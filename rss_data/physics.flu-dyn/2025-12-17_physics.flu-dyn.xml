      <title>Generalized relativistic second order magnetohydrodynamics: A correlation function approach using Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use total energy-momentum conservation and the Bianchi identity (magnetic-flux conservation) to construct second-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in a Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator (NESO) framework. We obtain all dissipative tensors in the medium by focusing on a relativistic magnetized plasma that preserves parity and is symmetric to charge-conjugation. We also provide Kubo formulas for all transport coefficients that arise at second order. Moreover, we extend the NESO formalism to systematically take into account for nonlocal contributions.</description>

      <title>The influence of surface tension in thin-film hydrodynamics: gravity free planar hydraulic jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydraulic jumps in thin films are traditionally explained through gravity-driven shallow-water theory, with surface tension assumed to play only a secondary role via Laplace pressure. Recent experiments, however, suggest that surface tension can be the primary mechanism. In this work we develop a theoretical framework for surface tension driven hydraulic jumps in planar thin-film flows. Starting from the full interfacial stress conditions, we show that the deviatoric component of the normal stress enters at leading order and fundamentally alters the balance. A dominant-balance analysis in the zero-gravity limit yields parameter-free governing equations, which admit a similarity solution for the velocity profile. Depth-averaged momentum conservation then reveals a singularity at unit Weber number, interpreted as the criterion for hydraulic control. This singularity is regularised by a non-trivial pressure gradient at the jump. This work establishes the theoretical basis for surface-tension-driven hydraulic jumps, providing analytical predictions for the jump location and structure.</description>

      <title>Efficient Time-Resolved Pressure Estimation by Sparse Sensor Optimization and Non-Time-Resolved PIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure field estimation from PIV data has been a well-established technique. However, time-resolved pressure estimation strongly depends on the temporal resolution of the PIV measurements. Generally, PIV data has limited time resolution creating challenges to understand high Reynolds number flows. To overcome this challenge, sensor data measured at few optimized locations with higher time resolution is combined with PIV data using data driven methods to reconstruct time resolved velocity fields. In this context, if we wish to estimate time resolved pressure fields from non-time resolved PIV data, there are two possible approaches. Approach 1: reconstruct time-resolved velocity field first from non-time resolved PIV data using sensor data, and then time-resolved pressure fields are estimated from time-resolved pressure fields by applying pressure Poisson equation. Approach 2: first estimate non-time resolved pressure fields from non-time resolved velocity field measurements using pressure Poisson equation and then reconstruct time resolved pressure fields directly from non-time resolved pressure fields. These two approaches are compared in this study. These approaches are demonstrated for actual PIV data of flow over a cylinder. Time-resolved PIV measurements are down-sampled to mimic non-time-resolved velocity data. It was found that the approach two is approximately thirty times faster than approach one when time resolution is improved from 1 Hz to 50 Hz. This is expected because in the second approach the pressure Poisson equation needs to be solved only with non-time resolved velocity fields which reduces the computational load.</description>

      <title>Turbulence enhancement of a fan array wind generator using geometric texturing and optimization-based control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fan array wind generators (FAWG) are designed to generate a rich set of turbulent flows reminiscent of those found in natural environments. In this study, we experimentally investigate a square FAWG consisting of 10x10 individually controllable fans with 4 cm width and a maximum velocity of 17 m/s. The goal is to maximize the turbulence intensity in the test region. Two approaches for fan operation are investigated: first, geometric texturing of the duty cycle distribution, and second, maximization of the turbulence intensity at selected hot-wire sensors with particle-swarm optimization. We find that geometric texturing (specifically a checkerboard pattern) yields a robust, uniform turbulence field (Tu ~ 0.14) driven by jet interactions. Conversely, particle swarm optimization achieves higher local turbulence (Tu ~ 0.28) but significantly sacrifices spatial uniformity. This study underscores the trade-off between local maximization and global uniformity in active turbulence generation.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network Closures for Complex-Shaped Particles in the Force-Coupling Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven surrogate framework to accelerate particle-resolved modelling of quasi-dilute suspensions of rigid, non-spherical particles in Stokes flow is introduced. A regularized-Stokeslet boundary element method (BEM) is implemented to compute hydrodynamic responses in canonical linear flows, focusing on the particle stresslet and angular velocity for spheroids, and additionally the chiral thrust for helicoidal particles. For spheroids, the BEM solver is validated against available analytical benchmarks (Faxen-type relations for the stresslet and Jeffery's theory for rotation), and parameter choices for surface discretization and regularization are selected through systematic convergence studies. For helicoidal particles, where no analytical solutions exist, accuracy is quantified via Richardson-style self-convergence, complemented by tests of linearity, frame objectivity, and chirality-dependent symmetries. The resulting datasets are used to train a neural-operator surrogate that maps local flow descriptors and particle configuration to the corresponding stresslet, rotation, and thrust at negligible evaluation cost. Across independent test sets spanning random orientations and flow types, the surrogate achieves median relative errors below 1% for the deviatoric stresslet (95th percentile below 3%) and comparable accuracy for angular velocity and thrust. The combination of validated BEM generation and fast inference provides a practical route to coupling complex particle shapes into mesoscale solvers such as the force-coupling method, enabling large-ensemble studies of microstructure and suspension rheology.</description>

      <title>An Ice Christmas Tree: Fast Three-Dimensional Printing of Ice Structures via Evaporative Cooling in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to three-dimensional (3D) printing of freeform ice structures by exploiting evaporative cooling. A micrometer-sized water jet is used to 3D print inside a vacuum chamber. The reduced ambient pressure leads to rapid evaporation of the extruded water, extracting latent heat, and quickly cooling the water well below 0 {\deg}C. Once deposited, the water freezes almost instantaneously into stable ice structures. We demonstrate high-fidelity printing of complex geometries (Christmas trees, cones, vertical pillars, and free-standing zigzag structures) without cryogenic infrastructure, supporting materials, or external refrigeration. This approach directly visualizes fundamental thermodynamic principles -- latent heat, evaporative cooling, and pressure-dependent phase transitions -- while offering a relatively simple and scalable platform for ice-templated microfluidics and tissue engineering, or even extraterrestrial 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive physics-informed neural network for forward and inverse problems in heterogeneous porous flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self-adaptive physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that reliably solves forward Darcy flow and performs accurate permeability inversion in heterogeneous porous media. In the forward setting, the PINN predicts velocity and pressure for discontinuous, piecewise-constant permeability; in the inverse setting, it identifies spatially varying permeability directly from indirect flow observations. Both models use a region-aware permeability parameterization with binary spatial masks, which preserves sharp permeability jumps and avoids the smoothing artifacts common in standard PINNs. To stabilize training, we introduce self-learned loss weights that automatically balance PDE residuals, boundary constraints, and data mismatch, eliminating manual tuning and improving robustness, particularly for inverse problems. An interleaved AdamW-L-BFGS optimization strategy further accelerates and stabilizes convergence. Numerical results demonstrate accurate forward surrogates and reliable inverse permeability recovery, establishing the method as an effective mesh-free solver and data-driven inversion tool for porous-media systems governed by partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>P-Bifurcations in Stochastic Flutter Model Under Common Gust Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aeroelastic flutter represents a critical nonlinear instability in flight dynamics, where the coupling between structural elasticity and unsteady aerodynamics leads to self-excited oscillations. In deterministic settings, the onset of flutter is typically characterized by bifurcations of invariant sets such as equilibria or limit cycles. However, real flight conditions are inherently stochastic due to atmospheric turbulence, rendering trajectory-based attractors insufficient for describing long-time behavior and motivating a probabilistic viewpoint. The stochastic nature of turbulence modifies these transitions, often generating high-dimensional stationary distributions which are difficult to visualize. In this work, we use a topological framework to detect and characterize such stochastic bifurcations in a two-degree-of-freedom aerofoil model with nonlinear stiffness. Reconstructing the full phase-space kernel density estimate (KDE) and constructing homological bifurcation plots reveal high-dimensional toroidal structures in the stationary probability density that are otherwise difficult to detect from two-dimensional projections. Further, we perform a comparative analysis of flutter under the influence of three classes of gust models: sinusoidal white Gaussian noise, the Dryden turbulence model, and the Von Karman turbulence model. Our analysis bypasses the predominantly used visual inspection in stochastic bifurcation studies, enabling systematic and automated exploration of stochastic flutter across large parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Large-scale patterns of small-scale vorticity interactions foster moist convection during cyclogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and intensification of a tropical cyclone is a complex phenomenon involving several feedback interactions between momentum and energetics of the storm, and across multiple spatio-temporal scales. Background vorticity interactions in the turbulent atmosphere play a crucial role in the formation of cyclones. How these vorticity interactions lead to convective organization and sustain a disastrous cyclonic vortex amidst a turbulent atmosphere remains elusive. Moreover, what processes distinguish depressions that develop into a cyclone from those that do not? Here, we investigate the role of small-scale vorticity interactions in the background flow in sustaining large-scale organization during the emergence of a cyclone. We construct time-varying complex networks where geographical locations are nodes and connections between nodes represent short-time vorticity correlations. Only those nodes are connected that are in spatial proximity corresponding to sub-meso length scales. Each network is constructed for 29 hours of data; consecutive networks are separated by three hours, thus revealing the evolution of local coherence in vorticity dynamics. We discover that small-scale vorticity interactions manifest as large-scale emergent patterns. Further, we establish that organized moist convection is significantly correlated to regions of locally coherent vorticity dynamics during the intensification of a depression that forms a cyclone; however, such correlations are not sustained during non-developing cases. Using modal analysis of time-evolving network connectivity, we show that these large-scale patterns are essentially large-scale modes of propagation of coherence in small-scale vorticity dynamics. We explain that such propagation is facilitated by moisture feedback at small-scales and self-organized patterns at large-scales.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic liquid crystal models for lipid bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained continuous descriptions for lipid bilayers are typically based on minimizing the Helfrich energy. Such models consider the fluid properties of these structures only implicitly and have been shown to nicely reproduce equilibrium properties. Model extensions that also address the dynamics of these structures are surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. They explicitly account for membrane viscosity. However, these models also usually treat the lipid bilayer as a homogeneous continuum, neglecting the molecular degrees of freedom of the lipids. Here, we derive refined models which consider in addition a scalar order parameter representing the molecular alignment of the lipids along the surface normal. Starting from hydrodynamic surface liquid crystal models, we obtain a hydrodynamic surface Landau--Helfrich model for asymmetric lipid bilayers and a surface Beris--Edwards model for symmetric lipid bilayers. The fully ordered case for both models leads to the known surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. Besides more detailed continuous models for lipid bilayers, we therefore also provide an alternative derivation of surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models.</description>

      <title>SuperWing: a comprehensive transonic wing dataset for data-driven aerodynamic design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning surrogate models have shown promise in accelerating aerodynamic design, yet progress toward generalizable predictors for three-dimensional wings has been limited by the scarcity and restricted diversity of existing datasets. Here, we present SuperWing, a comprehensive open dataset of transonic swept-wing aerodynamics comprising 4,239 parameterized wing geometries and 28,856 Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow field solutions. The wing shapes in the dataset are generated using a simplified yet expressive geometry parameterization that incorporates spanwise variations in airfoil shape, twist, and dihedral, allowing for an enhanced diversity without relying on perturbations of a baseline wing. All shapes are simulated under a broad range of Mach numbers and angles of attack covering the typical flight envelope. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we benchmark two state-of-the-art Transformers that accurately predict surface flow and achieve a 2.5 drag-count error on held-out samples. Models pretrained on SuperWing further exhibit strong zero-shot generalization to complex benchmark wings such as DLR-F6 and NASA CRM, underscoring the dataset's diversity and potential for practical usage.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal theorem for calculating the flow rate of oscillatory channel flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem in obtaining corrections to the steady flow rate due to flow oscillations in rigid channels. Starting from the unsteady Stokes equations, we derive the suitable reciprocity relation, assuming all quantities can be expressed as time-harmonic phasors. The auxiliary problem is the steady Hagen--Poiseuille flow solution, from which the reciprocal theorem allows us to calculate the first-order correction in the Womersley number to the steady flow rate in a straight rigid channel. We also consider nonuniform channels, specifically with variable height in the flow-wise direction, in which case the flow rate correction provides the leading-order effect of the interplay between the oscillations of the fluid flow and the given shape of the channel.</description>

      <title>Effects of lower floating-point precision on scale-resolving numerical simulations of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern computing clusters offer specialized hardware for reduced-precision arithmetic that can speed up the time to solution significantly. This is possible due to a decrease in data movement, as well as the ability to perform arithmetic operations at a faster rate. However, for high-fidelity simulations of turbulence, such as direct and large-eddy simulation, the impact of reduced precision on the computed solution and the resulting uncertainty across flow solvers and different flow cases have not been explored in detail and limits the optimal utilization of new high-performance computing systems. In this work, the effect of reduced precision is studied using four diverse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers (two incompressible, Neko and Simson, and two compressible, PadeLibs and SSDC) using four test cases: turbulent channel flow at Retau = 550 and higher, forced transition in a channel, flow over a cylinder at ReD = 3900, and compressible flow over a wing section at Rec = 50000. We observe that the flow physics are remarkably robust with respect to reduction in lower floating-point precision, and that often other forms of uncertainty, due to for example time averaging, often have a much larger impact on the computed result. Our results indicate that different terms in the Navier-Stokes equations can be computed to a lower floating-point accuracy without affecting the results. In particular, standard IEEE single precision can be used effectively for the entirety of the simulation, showing no significant discrepancies from double-precision results across the solvers and cases considered. Potential pitfalls are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Fluid Simulations in Structured Domains Using the Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity fluid simulations are central to understanding transport phenomena, yet resolving large or geometrically complex systems remains computationally prohibitive with existing methods. Recently, methods based on tensor-networks, commonly known as a quantum-inspired approach, were proposed to efficiently simulate flow in simple domains, where complexity emerges mostly from turbulence. Here, we substantially extend the understanding of such methods by demonstrating for the first time that also flows governed by translational or approximate symmetries of the geometry exhibit very low effective complexity in matrix product state (MPS) form. To this end, we introduce a tensor-network formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method based on MPS and demonstrate the generality of the method on three-dimensional flows through structured media and complex vascular geometries, establishing that tensor-network techniques can efficiently resolve fluid dynamics in complex domains previously inaccessible to MPS approaches. We show that in structured media, MPS representation yields compression ratios exceeding two orders of magnitude while preserving physical structure and dynamical fidelity. This reduction enables systematic numerical exploration of regimes that were previously intractable. Our results position tensor networks as a scalable paradigm for continuum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I further continue an investigation on Beltrami Flows began in 2015 with A. Sorin and amply revised and developed in 2022 with M. Trigiante. Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\mathbb{R}^3/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm. Indeed the present paper provides the theoretical foundations for such a algorithmic construction that is planned for a future publication.</description>

      <title>Shear jamming and nonlinear rheology of chocolate suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</description>
