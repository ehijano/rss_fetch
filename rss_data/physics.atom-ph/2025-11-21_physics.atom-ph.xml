      <title>Optimization of experimental parameters for laser-slowing and magneto-optical trapping of MgF molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diatomic molecules are promising systems for quantum science applications due to their complex energy structures and strong dipole-dipole interactions. Achieving ultracold temperatures is essential for these applications, but the complexity of molecular energy levels requires precise optimization of experimental parameters for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping (MOT). Here, we simulate and optimize the complete process of slowing and trapping MgF molecules, from a buffer-gas beam source to MOT capture, using Bayesian optimization. By combining laser slowing and MOT simulations, we identify parameters that maximize the capture velocity and the ratio of trapped molecules. Our results demonstrate a maximum MOT capture velocity of 82.5 m/s, and 28.6% of the molecules that reach the MOT region are trapped under optimal conditions. These findings provide insights into experimental setups for MgF and similar molecules, offering a framework for advancing molecular laser cooling and quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Laser Cooling Based on the $6\mathrm{P}_{3/2}$ Excited State of Rubidium Atoms via 420 nm Blue Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the laser cooling of rubidium atoms has inevitably relied on 780 nm cooling light corresponding to the first excited state $5\mathrm{P}_{3/2}$. Surprisingly, we demonstrate laser cooling directly utilizing 420 nm blue light for active optical clock, which corresponds to the high excited state $6\mathrm{P}_{3/2}$ of Rb atom. Experimentally, we successfully apply the 420 nm diffuse laser cooling technique to prepare a cold $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic cloud with a length of up to one meter, and measure the cold-atom absorption spectroscopy. The cold atom number is approximately $4.4\times10^{7}$. We systematically compare the cooling effects of 420 nm and 780 nm diffuse laser cooling, and verify the feasibility of blue light cooling using high excited state. This work directly employs blue light to cool and manipulate ground-state Rb atoms to the 6P excited state, providing a new and efficient approach for the cold-atom active optical clock. It is also expected to open up research directions and application prospects in frontier fields such as Rydberg atoms, ultracold quantum gases Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum information, and so on.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic passage of $^{205}$TlF with microwaves in a cryogenic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hyperfine-resolved state preparation scheme for thallium fluoride (TlF) molecules based on microwave-driven adiabatic passage (AP) in a spatially varying electric field. This method enables efficient and robust population transfer between selected $\left|J,m_J=0\right\rangle$ hyperfine sublevels of the $X\,^1\Sigma^+_0$ ground state in a cryogenic molecular beam, a key requirement for the CeNTREX search for nuclear time-reversal symmetry violation. Two sequential stages of AP are implemented. The first transfers population from $J=0$ to $J=1$ at a local field of $173~\mathrm{V/cm}$, and the second transfers from $J=1$ to $J=2$ at $110~\mathrm{V/cm}$. Transfer efficiencies are quantified through laser-induced fluorescence, and accounting for residual population in excited rotational levels after a prior stage of rotational cooling. We achieve state transfer efficiencies of $0.92(6)$ and $1.05(5)$ for the first and second states of AP, respectively. This corresponds to a total efficiency of $0.97(8)$ for population transfer from $J=0$ to $J=2$. These results demonstrate robust and high-fidelity preparation of specific rotational/hyperfine states in TlF.</description>

      <title>A low-energy effective Hamiltonian for Landau quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new renormalisation scheme to construct the Landau quasiparticles of Fermi fluids. The scheme relies on an energy cutoff $\Lambda$ which removes the quasi-resonant couplings, enabling the dressing of the particles into quasiparticles via a unitary transformation. The dynamics of the quasiparticles is then restricted to low-energy transitions and is fully determined by an effective Hamiltonian which unifies the Landau interaction function $f$ and the collision amplitude in a single amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ regularized by $\Lambda$. Our effective theory captures all the low-energy physics of Fermi fluids that support Landau quasiparticles, from the equation of state to the transport properties, both in the normal and in the superfluid phase. We apply it to an atomic Fermi gas with contact interaction to compute the speed of zero sound in function of the scattering length $a$. We also recover the Gork'ov-Melik Barkhudarov correction to the superfluid gap and critical temperature as a direct consequence of the dressing of particles into Landau quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Raman Spin-Dependent Kicks in the Presence of Micromotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose high-fidelity single-qubit spin-dependent kicks (SDKs) for trapped ions using nanosecond Raman pulses via amplitude modulation of a continuous-wave laser with a tunable beat frequency. We develop a general method for maintaining SDK performance in the presence of micromotion by identifying optimal choices of the RF phase and frequency that suppress unwanted backward kicks. The proposed scheme enables SDK infidelities as low as $10^{-9}$ in the absence of micromotion, and below $10^{-5}$ with micromotion. This study lays the foundation for the realization of sub-trap-period and high-fidelity two-qubit gates based on SDKs.</description>

      <title>Experiment to test one of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nearly 100 years, the incompleteness of quantum formalism and the probabilistic nature of measurement have been the subject of ongoing debate, with no interpretation achieving unanimous agreement. In double-slit interference experiments, standard quantum theory does not take particle size into account, which is not the case in de Broglie's double-solution theory. We use the large size of Rydberg atoms to propose an experiment to test the incompleteness of the standard quantum formalism. We present a variation on the double-slit experiment performed with Rydberg sodium atoms, in which a grating of very narrow slits is added between the two slits. Rydberg atoms are too big and cannot pass through the slits of the grating. We show with numerical simulations that the transmission densities in the standard interpretation and in the double-solution interpretation give very different results (a dark band appears in the center of the pattern). Experimental implementation now seems possible and would be a crucial test between these two interpretations.</description>
