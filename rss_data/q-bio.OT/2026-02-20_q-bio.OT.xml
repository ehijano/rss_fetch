      <title>Re-Solving the Shepherding Problem: Lead When Possible, Herd When Necessary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing systems for autonomous transport of groups of living agents has received a lot of attention in recent years due to a wealth of important potential applications. Biomimetic approaches are often sought, and a range of herding algorithms, inspired by how dogs herd sheep, as well as leadership algorithms mimicking leader-follower systems, have been introduced. However, they suffer from a common problem: shepherding algorithms require that agents evade the shepherd, and leading algorithms require that agents follow. This can cause problems in real-world applications where the behavioral responses of the agents to a transporter are likely to be heterogeneous over both long and short timescales. Here, we introduce an algorithm that adaptively switches between leading and herding depending on the response it receives from the agents to mitigate this problem. We show via simulation that this mixed algorithm can transport groups with any follower and evader composition, and we compare its performance with lead-only and herd-only algorithms. We also show that the mixed algorithm can deal with groups where individual agents randomly switch their strategy over time, as long as sufficient time is provided to complete the task relative to the switching rate. Given that our algorithm overcomes issues associated with herd-only and lead-only algorithms and might also, as a side effect, mitigate the issue of habituation to robotic transporters, it takes us one step closer to realizing many of the proposed applications for these types of algorithms.</description>

      <title>PREFER: An Ontology for the PREcision FERmentation Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision fermentation relies on microbial cell factories to produce sustainable food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and biofuels. Specialized laboratories such as biofoundries are advancing these processes using high-throughput bioreactor platforms, which generate vast datasets. However, the lack of community standards limits data accessibility and interoperability, preventing integration across platforms. In order to address this, we introduce PREFER, an open-source ontology designed to establish a unified standard for bioprocess data. Built in alignment with the widely adopted Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and connecting with several other community ontologies, PREFER ensures consistency and cross-domain compatibility and covers the whole precision fermentation process. Integrating PREFER into high-throughput bioprocess development workflows enables structured metadata that supports automated cross-platform execution and high-fidelity data capture. Furthermore, PREFER's standardization has the potential to bridge disparate data silos, generating machine-actionable datasets critical for training predictive, robust machine learning models in synthetic biology. This work provides the foundation for scalable, interoperable bioprocess systems and supports the transition toward more data-driven bioproduction.</description>

      <title>Geometric and topological constraints on oral seal formation during infant breastfeeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breastfeeding efficiency relies on coordinated tongue motion, sustained tissue contact and maintenance of an effective intraoral seal. Current assessments of seal formation mainly use local kinematic descriptors or pressure recordings, which do not capture the global structural continuity of the sealing region. We introduce a systolic geometry based approach in which each sagittal ultrasound frame is modeled as a two dimensional deformable domain bounded by tongue, palate and nipple contours. Global seal continuity is formalized through the shortest closed curve that cannot be contracted to a point because of the overall geometry of the domain. The nipple defines a central region that must be circumferentially enclosed by a contact band to maintain suction. Within this band, closed curves encircling the nipple exactly once can be identified; the shortest of these curves defines a normalized systolic index representing the tightest admissible sealing loop. Simulations of symmetric thinning, localized discontinuities and cyclic perturbations reveal feasibility boundaries separating seal preserving from seal breaking configurations. Notably, admissible encircling curves may transiently disappear even when overall geometric motion remains smooth. By capturing global circumferential continuity that cannot be inferred from local metrics alone, our approach generates testable hypotheses linking the existence and temporal stability of admissible encircling curves to milk transfer efficiency and vacuum stability. Applied to segmented ultrasound data and integrated with pressure measurements, our systolic approach could provide a quantitative framework for objective assessment of seal integrity and longitudinal monitoring of latch stability.</description>
