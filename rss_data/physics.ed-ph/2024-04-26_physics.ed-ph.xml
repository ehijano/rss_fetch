      <title>Laser Laboratory Beam Alignment Skills: Course Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of tutorials, assessments, and instructor guides are presented as a complete package for an upper-level undergraduate, or lower-level graduate, laboratory-based course, or extended new-student seminar. The purpose of this package is to teach the students essential skills beneficial for working in an experimental optical laboratory by introducing them to fundamental laboratory skills, and advanced optical alignment techniques. It is assumed that the students do not have any prior optical laboratory training or experience and the tutorials are written using detailed step-by-step instructions for the students to follow independently without the need for continual instructor guidance. The tutorials are intended to establish a common fundamental knowledge base and set of optical alignment skills within the group of students taking the course. Two examples of the target student groups for this package are: (1) an upper-level undergraduate optics course with a laboratory component (i.e., an undergraduate institution similar to Cal Poly), or (2) a cohort of new graduate students to an experimental optical program whose undergraduate backgrounds can span anything from no experimental optical experience to extensive experimental optical experience (i.e., an experimental R1 doctoral university similar to the Institut f\"ur Angewandte Physik at the Universit\"at Bonn). The accompanying assessments and instructor guides for each tutorial are provided in this package for the convenience of the course instructor(s) to use in the course as-is, or to use for their own reference of what skills to assess and how to tell if the student did the tasks correctly.</description>

      <title>Pocket Schlieren: a background oriented schlieren imaging platform on a smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background-oriented schlieren (BOS) is a powerful technique for flow visualization. Nevertheless, the widespread dissemination of BOS is impeded by its dependence on scientific cameras, computing hardware, and dedicated analysis software. In this work, we aim to democratize BOS by providing a smartphone based scientific tool called "Pocket Schlieren". Pocket Schlieren enables users to directly capture, process, and visualize flow phenomena on their smartphones. The underlying algorithm incorporates consecutive frame subtraction (CFS) and optical flow (OF) techniques to compute the density gradients inside a flow. It performs on both engineered and natural background patterns. Using Pocket Schlieren, we successfully visualized the flow produced from a burning candle flame, butane lighter, hot soldering iron, room heater, water immersion heating rod, and a large outdoor butane flame. Pocket Schlieren promises to serve as a frugal yet potent instrument for scientific and educational purposes. We have made it publicly available at doi: 10.5281/zenodo.10949271.</description>
