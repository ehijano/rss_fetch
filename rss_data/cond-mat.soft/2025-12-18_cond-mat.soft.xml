      <title>Memory-Induced Transport and Arrest in Flashing Ratchets: From Superdiffusion to Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of particles driven by colored noise in a flashing ratchet potential, focusing on both non-interacting and single-file interacting regimes. The model incorporates memory effects via a non-Markovian friction kernel, leading to superdiffusive dynamics and enhanced currents in the absence of interactions. However, when particles are constrained to single-file motion with hard-core repulsion, the same non-Markovian noise induces a dynamical transition: initial superdiffusion gives way to the formation of static clusters, ultimately suppressing net current. This transition occurs without a critical density and results from the interplay between noise persistence and the ratchet's potential. Our numerical results reveal a universal scaling behavior for the mean square displacement across densities, suggesting robustness of the clustering mechanism. These findings have potential implications for transport in crowded or confined systems such as colloidal suspensions, molecular motors in cellular environments, or microfluidic devices, where controlling noise and crowding can be used to tune transport efficiency.</description>

      <title>Buckling of knitted fabric wrapped around a rigid cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics exhibit high flexibility due to their periodic loop structures formed by bent yarns. Under compressive loading, they develop three-dimensional (3D) wrinkling patterns that reflect nonlinear interactions between yarn elasticity and local loop deformations, as observed when the sleeves of a sweater are rolled up. Despite their widespread use in garments and medical textiles, the relationship between loop-level geometry and macroscopic buckling remains less understood. Here, we investigate the 3D deformation of knitted fabrics wrapped around a rigid cylinder under uniaxial compression. Circumferential and axial stitch numbers are systematically varied to determine how loop geometry affects the evolution of wrinkle patterns. Samples with a small number of circumferential stitches exhibit sequential wrinkle formation from the compressed end, leading to an accordion-like wrinkle pattern, whereas those with a larger number of stitches form helical wrinkles simultaneously across the surface. Wrinkle morphology changes progressively with stitch geometry, accompanied by systematic variations in compressive force, loop deformation, and helical wrinkle angle. The development of helical wrinkles originates from subtle structural asymmetries introduced during manufacturing processes, including the tension applied during knitting and the direction of sample assembly. These results demonstrate that small variations in local loop deformation can lead to substantial differences in wrinkle morphology, highlighting the sensitivity of macroscopic buckling to microscopic structural features. The study establishes a direct link between loop-level mechanics and global deformation behavior, providing a basis for the predictive design of knitted structures with tailored mechanical responses and complex 3D patterns.</description>

      <title>Adhesive tape loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the mechanics of an \emph{adhesive tape loop}, formed by bending a straight rectangular strip with adhesive properties, and prescribing an overlap between the two ends. For a given combination of the adhesive strength and the extent of the overlap, the loop may unravel, it may stay in equilibrium, or open up quasi-statically to settle into an equilibrium with a smaller overlap. We define the state space of an adhesive tape loop with two parameters: a non-dimensional adhesion strength, and the extent of overlap normalized by the total length of the loop. We conduct experiments with adhesive tape loops fabricated out of sheets of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and record their states. We rationalize the experimental observations using a simple scaling argument, followed by a detailed theoretical model based on Kirchhoff rod theory. The predictions made by the theoretical model, namely the shape of the loops the states corresponding to equilibrium, show good agreement with the experimental data. Our model may potentially be used to deduce the strength of self-adhesion in sticky soft materials by simply measuring the smallest overlap needed to maintain a tape loop in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Extended defects in hard disk system and melting criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hard sphere model is widely used in description of fluids and solid media as a zero approximation to real systems. Despite the uniqueness of the model, few analytical results are known for it, both for the 2D and 3D cases. In present research we have investigated melting of the hard disk system by considering accumulation of extended defects of a certain type in the crystaline phase, and jamming of the disk packing. It results in formulation of melting criteria with lower and upper bounds on volume ratio at melting transition: $25/21 \le V/V_0 \le 5/4$. It was found that, in full agreement with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory, the 2D crystal melts into anisotropic liquid. The second transition, which is the transition between anisotropic and isotropic liquid has volume ratio $5/4 \le V/V_0 \le 13/9$.</description>

      <title>Experimental methods to control pinned and coupled actomyosin contraction events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actin and myosin drive many instances of force generation, deformation, and shape change in cells, tissues, and organisms. In particular, cytoskeletal actomyosin is remarkable in its adaptive architecture, responding to a host of actin-binding proteins. Equally important, however, is actomyosin's interaction with its mechanical environment. Actomyosin contractility and environmental properties, such as geometry and stiffness, are inherently coupled. To understand this coupling, novel experimental techniques are needed. Here we describe methods to spatially control the anchoring of reconstituted contractile actomyosin networks to two, opposing surfaces ("transverse anchoring"). The two surfaces can be either rigid ("pinned contraction"), or one of the surfaces may be compliant ("coupled contraction"). We introduce compliance by manufacturing flexure hinges, and describe their calibration. Calibration permits a direct measurement of the contractile force and mechanical work that actomyosin exerts on the environment. The methods described here provide an avenue toward a more complete characterization of actomyosin's role as an actuator, an essential property in its context of driving deformation and shape change in living systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Phase Diagram of Hard Sphere Dumbbells with Nested Sampling: Known Phases and New Packing Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of the nested sampling technique to sample the configuration space of non-spherical hard particles. We employ the technique on the hard dumbbell system consisting of two hard spheres connected by a rigid bond, and investigate the phase stability across a wide pressure range and for bond lengths from completely overlapping to tangential hard spheres. Nested sampling recovers all previously identified features of the phase diagram and identifies a family of new packing variants. The fluid phase, plastic crystal, close packed solid phases and aperiodic crystal are all sampled, and the transition points between these are mapped. Our results show good agreement with predictions made by existing equations of state, and former Monte Carlo simulations. Nested sampling also identified a close packed structure with Pnma symmetry which has not previously been considered.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor's Energy Landscape, Viscous Load, and Torque Generation Across Diffusion Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) converts transmembrane ion flux into directed mechanical rotation, driving bacterial motility. Despite extensive study, the frictional forces and energetics governing its torque generation remain poorly understood. Here, we combine single-molecule rotation measurements with stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively estimate its effective torque, viscous drag and activation energy barriers. We present three complementary methods based on solutions to the Smoluchowski equation for overdamped diffusion in a tilted periodic potential, which use as input the steady-state angular velocity and rotational diffusion data from individual \textit{E. coli} motors spanning different dynamical regimes. Crucially, these three methods require neither active external torque control, nor prior knowledge of the system's viscous drag or the motor's torque output. The first method assumes as input a model-dependent sinusoidal potential (single Fourier mode), albeit with unknown periodicity, yielding closed-form results in the low- and high-tilt limits, whereas the last two methods use a full Fourier-based reconstruction to output the now model-independent potential landscape. These approaches yield consistent estimates of the potential periodicity ($\approx$ 26-fold symmetry), energy barrier height ($\approx 2\!-\!4 k_{\rm B}T$), and internal friction coefficient ($\approx 0.1$ pN nm s rad$^{-2}$). Our results reveal that the BFM's torque-velocity relationship deviates significantly from the linear approximation near the critical tilt, where angular diffusion is maximized. More broadly, our framework provides a coherent strategy for reconstructing nanoscale energy landscapes from single-molecule data and is generalizable to other stepping molecular motors operating in cyclic conditions.</description>

      <title>Interacting Hysterons with Asymptotically Small or Large Spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of interacting hysteretic elements, called hysterons, capture the sequential response and complex memory effects in a wide range of complex systems and can guide the design of intelligent metamaterials. However, even simple models with few hysterons feature a bewildering number and variety of behaviors. Here we study the hysteron model in two physically relevant limits, where {the} response {of a hysteron system} is easier to understand. First, when the hysteron span - the gap between its two hysteretic transitions - dominates all other scales, the range of pathways encoded in transition graphs (t-graphs) becomes limited because many avalanches {are} absent. Second, when the hysteron span becomes vanishingly small, hysterons behave as interacting binary spins, {which require avalanches in order to} exhibit nontrivial pathways. Finally we show that hysterons can be mimicked by pairs of strongly interacting spins, {such} that collections of $n$ interacting hysterons can be mapped to $2n$ interacting spins, albeit {via} highly specific interactions. {Altogether,} our work provides a deeper understanding of the role of the hysteron parameters on their collective behavior, and points to connections and differences between spin- and hysteron-based models of complex matter.</description>

      <title>A reduced model for droplet dynamics with interfacial viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the phenomenological Maffettone-Minale (MM) model (P.L. Maffettone and M. Minale, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 78, 227-241 (1998)) to describe the time-dependent deformation of a droplet with interfacial viscosity in a shear flow. The droplet, characterised by surface tension $\sigma$, is spherical at rest with radius $R$ and deforms into an ellipsoidal shape under a shear flow of rate $G$, described by a symmetric second-order morphological tensor $\boldsymbol{S}$. In addition to surface tension, the extended MM (EMM) model incorporates interfacial shear and dilatational viscosities, $\mu_s$ and $\mu_d$, through the corresponding Boussinesq numbers $\mbox{Bq}_s=\mu_s/\mu R$ and $\mbox{Bq}_d=\mu_d/\mu R$, where $\mu$ is the bulk viscosity. A central goal of this work is to quantify the parameter range over which the EMM model provides a realistic description of droplet deformation, as a function of the capillary number Ca$=\mu R G/\sigma$ and the Boussinesq numbers. To this end, model predictions are systematically compared with fully resolved numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of capillary rising in corners. Using Onsager principle, we derive a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of meniscus profile. We obtain both numerical solutions and self-similar solutions to this partial differential equation. Our results show that the advance of the meniscus front follows a time-scaling of $t^{1/3}$, in agreement with the experimental results and theoretical conjecture of Ponomarenko et al.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium thermodynamics in driven macroscopic self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium statistical mechanics provides a robust framework for characterizing phase transitions in systems whose microsopic dynamics are time-reversible. Efforts to develop and validate theoretical frameworks for time-irreversible, non-equilibrium systems are constrained by experimental data that capture only partial measurements of the system dynamics. We herein overcome this limitation using a tunable macroscopic platform for non-equilibrium physics: millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface and driven out of equilibrium by a field of supercritical Faraday waves. The external driving induces correlated fluctuations in the particle trajectories, which in turn excite structural rearrangements between distinct metastable cluster topologies. By tracking all microstate transitions experimentally, we directly measure a non-zero entropy production rate reflecting broken detailed balance and quantifying the system's departure from equilibrium. The measured stochastic dynamics are in quantitative agreement with a many-body active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, thus establishing a bridge to a wider class of athermal, self-propelled systems at the microscale. These results invite parallel studies of non-equilibrium self-assembly kinetics using active colloids or passive particles immersed in bacterial baths whose dynamics and irreversibility are likewise governed by correlated active forces and tunable inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the machine learning of density functionals allows one to determine simultaneously the equilibrium chemical potential across simulation datasets of inhomogeneous classical fluids. Minimization of a loss function based on an Euler-Lagrange equation yields both the universal one-body direct correlation functional, which is represented locally by a neural network, as well as the system-specific unknown chemical potential values. The method can serve as an efficient alternative to conventional computational techniques of measuring the chemical potential. It also facilitates using canonical data from Brownian dynamics, molecular dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations as a basis for constructing neural density functionals, which are fit for accurate multiscale prediction of soft matter systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study flows generated within a two-dimensional corner by the chemical activity of the confining boundaries. Catalytic reactions at the surfaces induce diffusioosmotic motion of the viscous fluid throughout the domain. The presence of chemically active sectors can give rise to steady eddies reminiscent of classical Moffatt vortices, which are mechanically induced in similar confined geometries. In our approach, an exact analytical solution of the diffusion problem in a wedge geometry is derived and coupled to the diffusioosmotic slip-velocity formulation, yielding the stream function of associated Stokes flow. In selected limiting cases, simple closed-form expressions provide clear physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Our results open new perspectives for the design of microscale mixing strategies in dead-end pores and cornered microfluidic channels, and offer benchmarks for numerical simulations of confined (diffusio)osmotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider this effect from a macroscopic continuum perspective down to atomistic scales. First, we focus on the basic continuum example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under compressive plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes simply by adjusting the thickness of the surrounding shells, with no need to change the materials. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic levels using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. These extensions attest the robustness of our predictions down to atomistic scales. Thus, they open a straightforward possibility to adjust the strategy of mechanical cloaking via atomistic manipulations. From both perspectives, the underlying concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a spacelike singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>
