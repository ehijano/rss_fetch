      <title>Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in situations where posteriors are intractable or likelihood functions are treated as "black boxes." Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which transform a base distributions into a complex posterior by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions as an alternative to normalizing flows for NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. These gains persist across a variety of different encoder or "summary network" architectures, as well as in situations where no summary network is required. The code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/TianyuCodings/cDiff}.</description>

      <title>A novel longitudinal rank-sum test for multiple primary endpoints in clinical trials: Applications to neurodegenerative disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) present a significant global health challenge, characterized by cognitive decline, functional impairment, and other debilitating effects. Current AD clinical trials often assess multiple longitudinal primary endpoints to comprehensively evaluate treatment efficacy. Traditional methods, however, may fail to capture global treatment effects, require larger sample sizes due to multiplicity adjustments, and may not fully exploit multivariate longitudinal data. To address these limitations, we introduce the Longitudinal Rank Sum Test (LRST), a novel nonparametric rank-based omnibus test statistic. The LRST enables a comprehensive assessment of treatment efficacy across multiple endpoints and time points without multiplicity adjustments, effectively controlling Type I error while enhancing statistical power. It offers flexibility against various data distributions encountered in AD research and maximizes the utilization of longitudinal data. Extensive simulations and real-data applications demonstrate the LRST's performance, underscoring its potential as a valuable tool in AD clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Most Swiss-system tournaments are unfair: Evidence from chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swiss-system is an increasingly popular tournament format as it provides an attractive trade-off between the number of matches and ranking accuracy. However, few empirical research consider the optimal design of the Swiss-system. We contribute to this issue by investigating the fairness of Swiss-system chess competitions with an odd number of rounds, where half of the players have an extra game with white pieces. They are proven to enjoy a significant advantage and to be overrepresented among both the highest-ranked and outperforming players. Therefore, Swiss-system tournaments should have an even number of rounds and use a pairing mechanism that guarantees a balanced colour assignment.</description>

      <title>Insights into regression-based cross-temporal forecast reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-temporal forecast reconciliation aims to ensure consistency across forecasts made at different temporal and cross-sectional levels. We explore the relationships between sequential, iterative, and optimal combination approaches, and discuss the conditions under which a sequential reconciliation approach (either first-cross-sectional-then-temporal, or first-temporal-then-cross-sectional) is equivalent to a fully (i.e., cross-temporally) coherent iterative heuristic. Furthermore, we show that for specific patterns of the error covariance matrix in the regression model on which the optimal combination approach grounds, iterative reconciliation naturally converges to the optimal combination solution, regardless the order of application of the uni-dimensional cross-sectional and temporal reconciliation approaches. Theoretical and empirical properties of the proposed approaches are investigated through a forecasting experiment using a dataset of hourly photovoltaic power generation. The study presents a comprehensive framework for understanding and enhancing cross-temporal forecast reconciliation, considering both forecast accuracy and the often overlooked computational aspects, showing that significant improvement can be achieved in terms of memory space and computation time, two particularly important aspects in the high-dimensional contexts that usually arise in cross-temporal forecast reconciliation.</description>

      <title>Prediction of microstructural representativity from a single image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a method for predicting the representativity of the phase fraction observed in a single image (2D or 3D) of a material. Traditional approaches often require large datasets and extensive statistical analysis to estimate the Integral Range, a key factor in determining the variance of microstructural properties. Our method leverages the Two-Point Correlation function to directly estimate the variance from a single image (2D or 3D), thereby enabling phase fraction prediction with associated confidence levels. We validate our approach using open-source datasets, demonstrating its efficacy across diverse microstructures. This technique significantly reduces the data requirements for representativity analysis, providing a practical tool for material scientists and engineers working with limited microstructural data. To make the method easily accessible, we have created a web-application, \url{www.imagerep.io}, for quick, simple and informative use of the method.</description>

      <title>Generalized logistic model for $r$ largest order statistics, with hydrological application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective use of available information in extreme value analysis is critical because extreme values are scarce. Thus, using the $r$ largest order statistics (rLOS) instead of the block maxima is encouraged. Based on the four-parameter kappa model for the rLOS (rK4D), we introduce a new distribution for the rLOS as a special case of the rK4D. That is the generalized logistic model for rLOS (rGLO). This distribution can be useful when the generalized extreme value model for rLOS is no longer efficient to capture the variability of extreme values. Moreover, the rGLO enriches a pool of candidate distributions to determine the best model to yield accurate and robust quantile estimates. We derive a joint probability density function, the marginal and conditional distribution functions of new model. The maximum likelihood estimation, delta method, profile likelihood, order selection by the entropy difference test, cross-validated likelihood criteria, and model averaging were considered for inferences. The usefulness and practical effectiveness of the rGLO are illustrated by the Monte Carlo simulation and an application to extreme streamflow data in Bevern Stream, UK.</description>

      <title>Causal inference and policy evaluation without a control group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without a control group, the most widespread methodologies for estimating causal effects cannot be applied. To fill this gap, we propose the Machine Learning Control Method, a new approach for causal panel analysis that estimates causal parameters without relying on untreated units. We formalize identification within the potential outcomes framework and then provide estimation based on machine learning algorithms. To illustrate the practical relevance of our method, we present simulation evidence, a replication study, and an empirical application on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on educational inequality. We implement the proposed approach in the companion R package MachineControl</description>

      <title>Functional Clustering for Longitudinal Associations between Social Determinants of Health and Stroke Mortality in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10499v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the longitudinally changing associations between Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and stroke mortality is essential for effective stroke management. Previous studies have uncovered significant regional disparities in the relationships between SDOH and stroke mortality. However, existing studies have not utilized longitudinal associations to develop data-driven methods for regional division in stroke control. To fill this gap, we propose a novel clustering method to analyze SDOH -- stroke mortality associations in US counties. To enhance the interpretability of the clustering outcomes, we introduce a novel regularized expectation-maximization algorithm equipped with various sparsity-and-smoothness-pursued penalties, aiming at simultaneous clustering and variable selection in longitudinal associations. As a result, we can identify crucial SDOH that contribute to longitudinal changes in stroke mortality. This facilitates the clustering of US counties into different regions based on the relationships between these SDOH and stroke mortality. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies. By applying our method to longitudinal data on SDOH and stroke mortality at the county level, we identify 18 important SDOH for stroke mortality and divide the US counties into two clusters based on these selected SDOH. Our findings unveil complex regional heterogeneity in the longitudinal associations between SDOH and stroke mortality, providing valuable insights into region-specific SDOH adjustments for mitigating stroke mortality.</description>
