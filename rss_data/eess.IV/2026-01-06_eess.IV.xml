      <title>Placenta Accreta Spectrum Detection using Multimodal Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a life-threatening obstetric complication involving abnormal placental invasion into the uterine wall. Early and accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential to reduce maternal and neonatal risks. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning framework that enhances PAS detection by integrating multiple imaging modalities. A multimodal deep learning model was designed using an intermediate feature-level fusion architecture combining 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 2D Ultrasound (US) scans. Unimodal feature extractors, a 3D DenseNet121-Vision Transformer for MRI and a 2D ResNet50 for US, were selected after systematic comparative analysis. Curated datasets comprising 1,293 MRI and 1,143 US scans were used to train the unimodal models and paired samples of patient-matched MRI-US scans was isolated for multimodal model development and evaluation. On an independent test set, the multimodal fusion model achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 92.5% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.927, outperforming the MRI-only (82.5%, AUC 0.825) and US-only (87.5%, AUC 0.879) models. Integrating MRI and US features provides complementary diagnostic information, demonstrating strong potential to enhance prenatal risk assessment and improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>MetaFormer-driven Encoding Network for Robust Medical Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for medical image analysis, enabling precise disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many advanced models employ complex architectures, limiting their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. This paper proposes MFEnNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework that incorporates MetaFormer in the encoding phase of the U-Net backbone. MetaFormer, an architectural abstraction of vision transformers, provides a versatile alternative to convolutional neural networks by transforming tokenized image patches into sequences for global context modeling. To mitigate the substantial computational cost associated with self-attention, the proposed framework replaces conventional transformer modules with pooling transformer blocks, thereby achieving effective global feature aggregation at reduced complexity. In addition, Swish activation is used to achieve smoother gradients and faster convergence, while spatial pyramid pooling is incorporated at the bottleneck to improve multi-scale feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on different medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MFEnNet approach attains competitive accuracy while significantly lowering computational cost compared to state-of-the-art models.

      <title>Learned Hemodynamic Coupling Inference in Resting-State Functional MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides an indirect measurement of neuronal activity via hemodynamic responses that vary across brain regions and individuals. Ignoring this hemodynamic variability can bias downstream connectivity estimates. Furthermore, the hemodynamic parameters themselves may serve as important imaging biomarkers. Estimating spatially varying hemodynamics from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is therefore an important but challenging blind inverse problem, since both the latent neural activity and the hemodynamic coupling are unknown. In this work, we propose a methodology for inferring hemodynamic coupling on the cortical surface from rsfMRI. Our approach avoids the highly unstable joint recovery of neural activity and hemodynamics by marginalizing out the latent neural signal and basing inference on the resulting marginal likelihood. To enable scalable, high-resolution estimation, we employ a deep neural network combined with conditional normalizing flows to accurately approximate this intractable marginal likelihood, while enforcing spatial coherence through priors defined on the cortical surface that admit sparse representations. The proposed approach is extensively validated using synthetic data and real fMRI datasets, demonstrating clear improvements over current methods for hemodynamic estimation and downstream connectivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Calibrated Explainable AI for Fetal Ultrasound Plane Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard-plane classification underpins reliable prenatal biometry and anomaly screening, yet real-world deployment is limited by domain shift, image noise, and poor calibration of predicted probabilities. This paper presents a practical framework for uncertainty-calibrated explainable AI in fetal plane classification. We synthesize uncertainty estimation methods (Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, evidential learning, and conformal prediction) with post-hoc and uncertainty-aware explanations (Grad-CAM variants, LIME-style local surrogates, and uncertainty-weighted multi-resolution activation maps), and we map these components to a clinician-facing workflow. Using FETAL_PLANES_DB as a reference benchmark, we define a reporting protocol that couples accuracy with calibration and selective prediction, including expected calibration error, Brier score, coverage-risk curves, and structured error analysis with explanations. We also discuss integration points for quality control and human-in-the-loop review, where uncertainty flags trigger re-acquisition or expert confirmation. The goal is a reproducible, clinically aligned blueprint for building fetal ultrasound classifiers whose confidence and explanations remain trustworthy under noisy acquisition conditions.</description>

      <title>Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network with Limited Medical Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces critical challenges in semi-supervised learning scenarios due to severe annotation scarcity requiring expert radiological knowledge, significant inter-annotator variability across different viewpoints and expertise levels, and inadequate multi-scale feature integration for precise boundary delineation in complex anatomical structures. Existing semi-supervised methods demonstrate substantial performance degradation compared to fully supervised approaches, particularly in small target segmentation and boundary refinement tasks. To address these fundamental challenges, we propose SASNet (Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network), a dual-branch architecture that leverages both low-level and high-level feature representations through novel scale-aware adaptive reweight mechanisms. Our approach introduces three key methodological innovations, including the Scale-aware Adaptive Reweight strategy that dynamically weights pixel-wise predictions using temporal confidence accumulation, the View Variance Enhancement mechanism employing 3D Fourier domain transformations to simulate annotation variability, and segmentation-regression consistency learning through signed distance map algorithms for enhanced boundary precision. These innovations collectively address the core limitations of existing semi-supervised approaches by integrating spatial, temporal, and geometric consistency principles within a unified optimization framework. Comprehensive evaluation across LA, Pancreas-CT, and BraTS datasets demonstrates that SASNet achieves superior performance with limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods while approaching fully supervised performance levels. The source code for SASNet is available at https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/SASNet.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Agentic AI Framework for Uncertainty-Aware and Abstention-Enabled Acute Ischemic Stroke Imaging Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown strong potential in acute ischemic stroke imaging, particularly for lesion detection and segmentation using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most existing approaches operate as black box predictors, producing deterministic outputs without explicit uncertainty awareness or structured mechanisms to abstain under ambiguous conditions. This limitation raises serious safety and trust concerns in high risk emergency radiology settings. In this paper, we propose an explainable agentic AI framework for uncertainty aware and abstention enabled decision support in acute ischemic stroke imaging. The framework follows a modular agentic pipeline in which a perception agent performs lesion aware image analysis, an uncertainty estimation agent computes slice level predictive reliability, and a decision agent determines whether to issue a prediction or abstain based on predefined uncertainty thresholds. Unlike prior stroke imaging systems that primarily focus on improving segmentation or classification accuracy, the proposed framework explicitly prioritizes clinical safety, transparency, and clinician aligned decision behavior. Qualitative and case based analyses across representative stroke imaging scenarios demonstrate that uncertainty driven abstention naturally emerges in diagnostically ambiguous regions and low information slices. The framework further integrates visual explanation mechanisms to support both predictive and abstention decisions, addressing a key limitation of existing uncertainty aware medical imaging systems. Rather than introducing a new performance benchmark, this work presents agentic control, uncertainty awareness, and selective abstention as essential design principles for developing safe and trustworthy medical imaging AI systems.</description>

      <title>YODA: Yet Another One-step Diffusion-based Video Compressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While one-step diffusion models have recently excelled in perceptual image compression, their application to video remains limited. Prior efforts typically rely on pretrained 2D autoencoders that generate per-frame latent representations independently, thereby neglecting temporal dependencies. We present YODA--Yet Another One-step Diffusion-based Video Compressor--which embeds multiscale features from temporal references for both latent generation and latent coding to better exploit spatial-temporal correlations for more compact representation, and employs a linear Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for efficient one-step denoising. YODA achieves state-of-the-art perceptual performance, consistently outperforming traditional and deep-learning baselines on LPIPS, DISTS, FID, and KID. Source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/NJUVISION/YODA.</description>

      <title>Seamlessly Natural: Image Stitching with Natural Appearance Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces SENA (SEamlessly NAtural), a geometry-driven image stitching approach that prioritizes structural fidelity in challenging real-world scenes characterized by parallax and depth variation. Conventional image stitching relies on homographic alignment, but this rigid planar assumption often fails in dual-camera setups with significant scene depth, leading to distortions such as visible warps and spherical bulging. SENA addresses these fundamental limitations through three key contributions. First, we propose a hierarchical affine-based warping strategy, combining global affine initialization with local affine refinement and smooth free-form deformation. This design preserves local shape, parallelism, and aspect ratios, thereby avoiding the hallucinated structural distortions commonly introduced by homography-based models. Second, we introduce a geometry-driven adequate zone detection mechanism that identifies parallax-minimized regions directly from the disparity consistency of RANSAC-filtered feature correspondences, without relying on semantic segmentation. Third, building upon this adequate zone, we perform anchor-based seamline cutting and segmentation, enforcing a one-to-one geometric correspondence across image pairs by construction, which effectively eliminates ghosting, duplication, and smearing artifacts in the final panorama.
  Extensive experiments conducted on challenging datasets demonstrate that SENA achieves alignment accuracy comparable to leading homography-based methods, while significantly outperforming them in critical visual metrics such as shape preservation, texture integrity, and overall visual realism.</description>

      <title>Sim2Real SAR Image Restoration: Metadata-Driven Models for Joint Despeckling and Sidelobes Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides valuable information about the Earth's surface under all weather and illumination conditions. However, the inherent phenomenon of speckle and the presence of sidelobes around bright targets pose challenges for accurate interpretation of SAR imagery. Most existing SAR image restoration methods address despeckling and sidelobes reduction as separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that jointly performs both tasks using neural networks (NNs) trained on a realistic SAR simulated dataset generated with MOCEM. Inference can then be performed on real SAR images, demonstrating effective simulation to real (Sim2Real) transferability. Additionally, we incorporate acquisition metadata as auxiliary input to the NNs, demonstrating improved restoration performance.</description>

      <title>UniCrop: A Universal, Multi-Source Data Engineering Pipeline for Scalable Crop Yield Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crop yield prediction relies on diverse data streams, including satellite, meteorological, soil, and topographic information. However, despite rapid advances in machine learning, existing approaches remain crop- or region-specific and require data engineering efforts. This limits scalability, reproducibility, and operational deployment. This study introduces UniCrop, a universal and reusable data pipeline designed to automate the acquisition, cleaning, harmonisation, and engineering of multi-source environmental data for crop yield prediction. For any given location, crop type, and temporal window, UniCrop automatically retrieves, harmonises, and engineers over 200 environmental variables (Sentinel-1/2, MODIS, ERA5-Land, NASA POWER, SoilGrids, and SRTM), reducing them to a compact, analysis-ready feature set utilising a structured feature reduction workflow with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). To validate, UniCrop was applied to a rice yield dataset comprising 557 field observations. Using only the selected 15 features, four baseline machine learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Elastic Net) were trained. LightGBM achieved the best single-model performance (RMSE = 465.1 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6576$), while a constrained ensemble of all baselines further improved accuracy (RMSE = 463.2 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6604$). UniCrop contributes a scalable and transparent data-engineering framework that addresses the primary bottleneck in operational crop yield modelling: the preparation of consistent and harmonised multi-source data. By decoupling data specification from implementation and supporting any crop, region, and time frame through simple configuration updates, UniCrop provides a practical foundation for scalable agricultural analytics. The code and implementation documentation are shared in https://github.com/CoDIS-Lab/UniCrop.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Video Transmission over Multipath Fading Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenges of wireless video transmission over multipath fading channels, we propose a robust deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) framework by effectively exploiting temporal redundancy and incorporating robust innovations at the modulation, coding, and decoding stages. At the modulation stage, tailored orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for robust video transmission is employed, decomposing wideband signals into orthogonal frequency-flat sub-channels to effectively mitigate frequency-selective fading. At the coding stage, conditional contextual coding with multi-scale Gaussian warped features is introduced to efficiently model temporal redundancy, significantly improving reconstruction quality under strict bandwidth constraints. At the decoding stage, a lightweight denoising module is integrated to robustly simplify signal restoration and accelerate convergence, addressing the suboptimality and slow convergence typically associated with simultaneously performing channel estimation, equalization, and semantic reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robust framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video DeepJSCC methods, achieving an average reconstruction quality gain of 5.13 dB under challenging multipath fading channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction Using Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is essential across various disciplines for its capacity to capture rich spectral information. However, efficiently reconstructing hyperspectral images from compressive sensing measurements presents significant challenges. To tackle these, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that capitalizes on the unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images. We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based RGB and multispectral image dataset collected over paddy fields in the Vijayawada region, Andhra Pradesh, India, covering nursery to harvesting stages. We used a 20-megapixel RGB camera and a 5-megapixel four-band multispectral camera capturing red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared bands. Standardised operating procedure (SOP) and checklists were developed to ensure repeatable data acquisition. Our dataset comprises of 42,430 raw images (415 GB) captured over 5 acres with 1 cm/pixel ground sampling distance (GSD) with associated metadata such as GPS coordinates, flight altitude, and environmental conditions. Captured images were validated using Pix4D Fields to generate orthomosaic maps and vegetation index maps, such as normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalised difference red-edge (NDRE) index. Our dataset is one of the few datasets that provide high-resolution images with rich metadata that cover all growth stages of Indian paddy crops. The dataset is available on IEEE DataPort with DOI, . It can support studies on targeted spraying, disease analysis, and yield estimation.</description>

The proposed model introduces (i) a combined loss term aligning the global color statistics through differentiable histogram matching, perceptual image quality measure, and feature based similarity to preserve texture information, (ii) local hue-saturation priors injected via Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SPADE) to stabilize chromatic reconstruction, and (iii) texture-aware supervision within a Mamba backbone to preserve fine details. We introduce an adaptive-resolution inference engine that further enables high-resolution translation without sacrificing quality. Our proposed NIR-to-RGB translation model simultaneously enforces global color statistics and local chromatic consistency, while scaling to native resolutions without compromising texture fidelity or generalization. Extensive evaluations on FANVID, OMSIV, VCIP2020, and RGB2NIR using different evaluation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods. HAQAGen produces images with sharper textures, natural colors, attaining significant gains as per perceptual metrics. These results position HAQAGen as a scalable and effective solution for NIR-to-RGB translation across diverse imaging scenarios. Project Page: https://rajeev-dw9.github.io/HAQAGen/</description>

      <title>MS-ISSM: Objective Quality Assessment of Point Clouds Using Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds poses a significant challenge for objective quality assessment (PCQA), particularly in establishing accurate perceptual feature correspondence. To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MS-ISSM outperforms state-of-the-art metrics in both reliability and generalization.

      <title>LinMU: Multimodal Understanding Made Linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve impressive performance but are limited by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which prevents their deployment on edge devices and makes their understanding of high-resolution images and long-context videos prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos.</description>

      <title>DDNet: A Dual-Stream Graph Learning and Disentanglement Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of AIGC technology enables misleading viewers by tampering mere small segments within a video, rendering video-level detection inaccurate and unpersuasive. Consequently, temporal forgery localization (TFL), which aims to precisely pinpoint tampered segments, becomes critical. However, existing methods are often constrained by \emph{local view}, failing to capture global anomalies. To address this, we propose a \underline{d}ual-stream graph learning and \underline{d}isentanglement framework for temporal forgery localization (DDNet). By coordinating a \emph{Temporal Distance Stream} for local artifacts and a \emph{Semantic Content Stream} for long-range connections, DDNet prevents global cues from being drowned out by local smoothness. Furthermore, we introduce Trace Disentanglement and Adaptation (TDA) to isolate generic forgery fingerprints, alongside Cross-Level Feature Embedding (CLFE) to construct a robust feature foundation via deep fusion of hierarchical features. Experiments on ForgeryNet and TVIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by approximately 9\% in AP@0.95, with significant improvements in cross-domain robustness.</description>

      <title>COMPASS: High-Efficiency Deep Image Compression with Arbitrary-scale Spatial Scalability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, neural network (NN)-based image compression studies have actively been made and has shown impressive performance in comparison to traditional methods. However, most of the works have focused on non-scalable image compression (single-layer coding) while spatially scalable image compression has drawn less attention although it has many applications. In this paper, we propose a novel NN-based spatially scalable image compression method, called COMPASS, which supports arbitrary-scale spatial scalability. Our proposed COMPASS has a very flexible structure where the number of layers and their respective scale factors can be arbitrarily determined during inference. To reduce the spatial redundancy between adjacent layers for arbitrary scale factors, our COMPASS adopts an inter-layer arbitrary scale prediction method, called LIFF, based on implicit neural representation. We propose a combined RD loss function to effectively train multiple layers. Experimental results show that our COMPASS achieves BD-rate gain of -58.33% and -47.17% at maximum compared to SHVC and the state-of-the-art NN-based spatially scalable image compression method, respectively, for various combinations of scale factors. Our COMPASS also shows comparable or even better coding efficiency than the single-layer coding for various scale factors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Blind Video Quality Assessment with Rich Quality-aware Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) is a highly challenging task due to the intrinsic complexity of video content and visual distortions, especially given the high popularity of social media videos, which originate from a wide range of sources, and are often processed by various compression and enhancement algorithms. While recent BVQA and blind image quality assessment (BIQA) studies have made remarkable progress, their models typically perform well on the datasets they were trained on but generalize poorly to unseen videos, making them less effective for accurately evaluating the perceptual quality of diverse social media videos. In this paper, we propose Rich Quality-aware features enabled Video Quality Assessment (RQ-VQA), a simple yet effective method to enhance BVQA by leveraging rich quality-aware features extracted from off-the-shelf BIQA and BVQA models. Our approach exploits the expertise of existing quality assessment models within their trained domains to improve generalization. Specifically, we design a multi-source feature framework that integrates:(1) Learnable spatial features} from a base model fine-tuned on the target VQA dataset to capture domain-specific quality cues; (2) Temporal motion features from the fast pathway of SlowFast pre-trained on action recognition datasets to model motion-related distortions; (3) Spatial quality-aware features from BIQA models trained on diverse IQA datasets to enhance frame-level distortion representation; and (4) Spatiotemporal quality-aware features from a BVQA model trained on large-scale VQA datasets to jointly encode spatial structure and temporal dynamics. These features are concatenated and fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to regress them into quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public social media VQA datasets.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential and Future Cardiomyopathy from Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Deep Learning in a Cardio-oncology Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep learning framework to identify clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a somatic mutation condition associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, using routine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Utilizing 152 multi-view late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) scans from 136 cardio-oncology patients, we developed a convolutional neural network to (1) detect CHIP status and (2) stratify the risk of future cardiomyopathy specifically within the CHIP-positive cohort. To ensure robustness, we performed rigorous feature importance analysis to rule out reliance on demographic confounders such as age and immune checkpoint inhibitor usage. The model achieved an AUC of 0.71 for CHIP detection and, notably, an AUC of 0.87 for predicting future cardiomyopathy in CHIP-positive patients, significantly outperforming demographic-only baselines. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using LGE-CMR signatures as a non-invasive "radiogenomic" screening tool, potentially enabling accessible risk stratification and precision medicine for high-risk cardiovascular populations.</description>

      <title>Scan-Adaptive MRI Undersampling Using Neighbor-based Optimization (SUNO)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09799v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerated MRI involves collecting partial $k$-space measurements to reduce acquisition time, patient discomfort, and motion artifacts, and typically uses regular undersampling patterns or human-designed schemes. Recent works have studied population-adaptive sampling patterns learned from a group of patients (or scans). However, such patterns can be sub-optimal for individual scans, as they may fail to capture scan or slice-specific details, and their effectiveness can depend on the size and composition of the population. To overcome this issue, we propose a framework for jointly learning scan-adaptive Cartesian undersampling patterns and a corresponding reconstruction model from a training set. We use an alternating algorithm for learning the sampling patterns and the reconstruction model where we use an iterative coordinate descent (ICD) based offline optimization of scan-adaptive $k$-space sampling patterns for each example in the training set. A nearest neighbor search is then used to select the scan-adaptive sampling pattern at test time from initially acquired low-frequency $k$-space information. We applied the proposed framework (dubbed SUNO) to the fastMRI multi-coil knee and brain datasets, demonstrating improved performance over the currently used undersampling patterns at both $4\times$ and $8\times$ acceleration factors in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The code for the proposed framework is available at https://github.com/sidgautam95/adaptive-sampling-mri-suno.</description>

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes), we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152 achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&amp;E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions by utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&amp;E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&amp;E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&amp;E image repositories.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Adaptive Quantization for Variable Rate Image Coding for Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) has become increasingly important with the rapid integration of computer vision technology into real-world applications. However, most neural network-based ICM frameworks operate at a fixed rate, thus requiring individual training for each target bitrate. This limitation may restrict their practical usage. Existing variable rate image compression approaches mitigate this issue but often rely on additional training, which increases computational costs and complicates deployment. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free framework for quantization strength control which enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By exploiting the scale parameter predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method adaptively modulates quantization step sizes across both channel and spatial dimensions. This allows the model to preserve semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. Our architectural design further enables continuous bitrate control through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate baseline. The code is available at https://github.com/qwert-top/AQVR-ICM.</description>

      <title>P2U-SLAM: A Monocular Wide-FoV SLAM System Based on Point Uncertainty and Pose Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents P2U-SLAM, a visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system with a wide Field of View (FoV) camera, which utilizes pose uncertainty and point uncertainty. While the wide FoV enables considerable repetitive observations of historical map points for matching cross-view features, the data properties of the historical map points and the poses of historical keyframes have changed during the optimization process. The neglect of data property changes results in the lack of partial information matrices in optimization, increasing the risk of long-term positioning performance degradation. The purpose of our research is to mitigate the risks posed by wide-FoV visual input to the SLAM system. Based on the conditional probability model, this work reveals the definite impacts of the above data properties changes on the optimization process, concretizes these impacts as point uncertainty and pose uncertainty, and gives their specific mathematical form. P2U-SLAM embeds point uncertainty into the tracking module and pose uncertainty into the local mapping module respectively, and updates these uncertainties after each optimization operation including local mapping, map merging, and loop closing. We present an exhaustive evaluation on 27 sequences from two popular public datasets with wide-FoV visual input. P2U-SLAM shows excellent performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/BambValley/P2U-SLAM.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for geometry-independent operator learning in cardiac electrophysiology simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning biophysically accurate solution operators for cardiac electrophysiology is fundamentally challenged by geometric variability across patient-specific heart anatomies. Most existing neural operator approaches are limited to structured or weakly deformed domains, restricting their applicability to realistic atrial and ventricular geometries. Here, we introduce a unified operator-learning framework that projects inputs and outputs onto a standardised anatomical coordinate system, decoupling electrophysiological dynamics from mesh topology. This formulation enables geometry-independent learning while preserving physiologically meaningful spatial organisation, and allows predictions to be interpolated back onto patient-specific geometries for anatomical interpretation.
  To support large-scale training within the framework, we develop a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver and generate over 300,000 high-fidelity simulations across diverse patient-specific left atrial geometries with varied pacing and conduction properties. Within this anatomical coordinate domain, we design a neural operator to predict full-field local activation time maps, achieving a mean absolute error of 5.1 ms and an inference time of 0.12 ms per sample, outperforming existing operator learning and convolutional baselines. We further validate the framework on ventricular geometries, demonstrating robust generalisation beyond the atrial setting. Together, this framework establishes a scalable foundation for fast, geometry-invariant cardiac electrophysiology modelling, with potential relevance for real-time and population-scale clinical workflows.</description>
