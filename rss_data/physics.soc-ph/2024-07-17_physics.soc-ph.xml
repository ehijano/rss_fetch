      <title>Competition between group interactions and nonlinearity in voter dynamics on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), in which we incorporate the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimum minimizing exit time {\tau} . We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with N nodes, for which {\tau} scales as A ln N, where the prefactor A depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Advantage of Brokerage in Academia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science is a collaborative endeavor in which "who collaborates with whom" profoundly influences scientists' career trajectories and success. Despite its relevance, little is known about how scholars facilitate new collaborations among their peers. In this study, we quantify brokerage in academia and study its effect on the careers of physicists worldwide. We find that early-career participation in brokerage increases later-stage involvement for all researchers, with increasing participation rates and greater career impact among more successful scientists. This cumulative advantage process suggests that brokerage contributes to the unequal distribution of success in academia. Surprisingly, this affects both women and men equally, despite women being more junior in all brokerage roles and lagging behind men's participation due to their late and slow arrival to physics. Because of its cumulative nature, promoting brokerage opportunities to early career scientists might help reduce the inequalities in academic success.</description>

      <title>Quantum-tunnelling deep neural networks for sociophysical neuromorphic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum tunnelling effect -- the transmission of particles through a high potential barrier -- was one of the most impressive achievements of quantum mechanics made in the 1920s. Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of quantum tunnelling. I demonstrate the ability of the quantum tunnelling DNN (QT-DNN) to recognise optical illusions like a human. Hardware implementation of QT-DNN is expected to result in an inexpensive and energy-efficient neuromorphic chip suitable for applications in autonomous vehicles. The optical illusions recognition tests developed in this paper should lay foundations for cognitive benchmarking tasks for AI systems of the future, benefiting the fields of sociophysics and behavioural science.</description>

      <title>Lessons from a human-in-the-loop machine learning approach for identifying vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated properties in Savannah, Georgia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing strategies for managing vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated (VAD) properties is important for maintaining healthy communities. Yet, the process of identifying these properties can be difficult. Here, we create a human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITLML) model called VADecide and apply it to a parcel-level case study in Savannah, Georgia. The results show a higher prediction accuracy than was achieved when using a machine learning model without human input in the training. The HITLML approach also reveals differences between machine vs. human-generated results. Our findings contribute to knowledge about the advantages and challenges of HITLML in urban planning.

      <title>Independence role in the generalized Sznajd model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sznajd model is one of sociophysics's well-known opinion dynamics models. Based on social validation, it has found application in diverse social systems and remains an intriguing subject of study, particularly in scenarios where interacting agents deviate from prevailing norms. This paper investigates the generalized Sznajd model, featuring independent agents on a complete graph and a two-dimensional square lattice. Agents in the network act independently with a probability $p$, signifying a change in their opinion or state without external influence. This model defines a paired agent size $r$, influencing a neighboring agent size $n$ to adopt their opinion. This study incorporates analytical and numerical approaches, especially on the complete graph. Our results show that the macroscopic state of the system remains unaffected by the neighbor size $n$ but is contingent solely on the number of paired agents $r$. Additionally, the time required to reach a stationary state is inversely proportional to the number of neighboring agents $n$. For the two-dimensional square lattice, two critical points $p = p_c$ emerge based on the configuration of agents. The results indicate that the universality class of the model on the complete graph aligns with the mean-field Ising universality class. Furthermore, the universality class of the model on the two-dimensional square lattice, featuring two distinct configurations, is identical and falls within the two-dimensional Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Early-Career Researchers' Perspective on Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its inception, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has significantly advanced particle physics and will continue to do so in the context of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program to collect $3000$ fb$^{-1}$ by the end of 2041. The particle physics community worldwide is discussing which future collider could follow in the footsteps of the LHC and uncover yet inaccessible phenomena.
  To foster the discussion on this important topic among the young particle physicist community, the Early-Career Researchers (ECR) panel of the European Committee for Future Colliders (ECFA) has organized the Future Colliders for Early-Career Researchers workshop at CERN in September 2023. This document aims to summarise this event and present the ECR perspective, outline the key questions that came up during the discussions, and explore how ECRs can influence the decision process of future colliders community and beyond.</description>
