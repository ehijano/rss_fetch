      <title>Deformations and extensions of modified $\lambda$-differential Lie-Yamaguti algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the concept and representations of modified $\lambda$-differential Lie-Yamaguti algebras. We then establish the cohomology of a modified $\lambda$-differential Lie-Yamaguti algebra with coefficients in a representation. As applications, we investigate the formal deformations and abelian extensions of modified $\lambda$-differential Lie-Yamaguti algebras by using the second cohomology group.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of Poisson-type algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degenerations of Poisson-type algebras are studied in the following varieties in dimension two: Leibniz--Poisson algebras, transposed Leibniz--Poisson algebras, Novikov--Poisson algebras, commutative pre-Lie algebras, anti-pre-Lie Poisson algebras and pre-Poisson algebras. For these varieties, the algebraic and geometric classifications are given. Also, the complete graph of degenerations is obtained, together with the description of the orbit closures of each of its algebras and parametric families up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative factorizations and finite-dimensional representations of free algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very first step to develop non-commutative algebraic geometry is the arithmetic of polynomials in non-commuting variables over a commutative field, that is, the study of elements in free associative algebras. This investigation is presented as a natural extension of the classical theory in one variable by using Leavitt algebras, which are localizations of free algebras with respect to the Gabriel topology defined by an ideal of codimension 1. In particular to any polynomial in n non-commuting variables with non-zero constant term we associate a finite-dimensional module over the free algebra of rank n, which turns out to be simple if and only if the polynomial is irreducible. This approach leads to new insights in the study of the factorization of polynomials into irreducible ones and other related topics, such as an algorithm to divide polynomials or to compute the greatest common divisor between them, or a description of similar polynomials. The case of polynomials with zero constant term reduces to an open question whether the intersection of nonunital subalgebras of codimension 1 in a free associative algebra is trivial, that is, 0.</description>

      <title>Chain rule symmetry for singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the chain rule symmetry for the geometric stochastic heat equations in the full subcritical regime for Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. We show that the renormalised counter-terms that give a solution invariant under changes of coordinates are generated by iterations of covariant derivatives. The result was known only for space-time white noises, with a very specific proof that so far could not be extended to the general case. The key idea of the present paper is to change the perspective on several levels and to use ideas coming from operad theory and homological algebra. Concretely, we introduce the operad of Christoffel trees that captures the counter-terms of the renormalised equation; our main new insight is to describe the space of invariant terms homologically, using a suitable perturbation of the differential of the operadic twisting of that operad. As a consequence, we obtain the correct renormalisation for the quasi-linear KPZ equation in the subcritical regime completing the programme started by Hairer and Gerencser. Previously, the main algebraic tool used in the study of singular SPDEs were Hopf algebras of decorated trees; our work shows that operad theory and homological algebra add new powerful tools with immediate applications to open problems that were out of reach by other methods.</description>

      <title>Weak polynomial identities of small degree for the Weyl algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate weak polynomial identities for the Weyl algebra $\mathsf{A}_1$ over an infinite field of arbitrary characteristic. Namely, we describe weak polynomial identities of the minimal degree, which is three, and of degrees 4 and 5. We also describe weak polynomial identities is two variables.</description>
