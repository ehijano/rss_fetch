      <title>Sample-efficient neural likelihood-free Bayesian inference of implicit HMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Likelihood-free inference methods based on neural conditional density estimation were shown to drastically reduce the simulation burden in comparison to classical methods such as ABC. When applied in the context of any latent variable model, such as a Hidden Markov model (HMM), these methods are designed to only estimate the parameters, rather than the joint distribution of the parameters and the hidden states. Naive application of these methods to a HMM, ignoring the inference of this joint posterior distribution, will thus produce an inaccurate estimate of the posterior predictive distribution, in turn hampering the assessment of goodness-of-fit. To rectify this problem, we propose a novel, sample-efficient likelihood-free method for estimating the high-dimensional hidden states of an implicit HMM. Our approach relies on learning directly the intractable posterior distribution of the hidden states, using an autoregressive-flow, by exploiting the Markov property. Upon evaluating our approach on some implicit HMMs, we found that the quality of the estimates retrieved using our method is comparable to what can be achieved using a much more computationally expensive SMC algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Bayesian Last Layer for Regression: Uncertainty Quantification and Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Bayesian Last Layer models in the setting of multivariate regression under heteroscedastic noise, and propose an optimization algorithm for parameter learning. Bayesian Last Layer combines Bayesian modelling of the predictive distribution with neural networks for parameterization of the prior, and has the attractive property of uncertainty quantification with a single forward pass. The proposed framework is capable of disentangling the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, and can be used to transfer a canonically trained deep neural network to new data domains with uncertainty-aware capability.</description>

      <title>Three Quantization Regimes for ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the fundamental limits in the approximation of Lipschitz functions by deep ReLU neural networks with finite-precision weights. Specifically, three regimes, namely under-, over-, and proper quantization, in terms of minimax approximation error behavior as a function of network weight precision, are identified. This is accomplished by deriving nonasymptotic tight lower and upper bounds on the minimax approximation error. Notably, in the proper-quantization regime, neural networks exhibit memory-optimality in the approximation of Lipschitz functions. Deep networks have an inherent advantage over shallow networks in achieving memory-optimality. We also develop the notion of depth-precision tradeoff, showing that networks with high-precision weights can be converted into functionally equivalent deeper networks with low-precision weights, while preserving memory-optimality. This idea is reminiscent of sigma-delta analog-to-digital conversion, where oversampling rate is traded for resolution in the quantization of signal samples. We improve upon the best-known ReLU network approximation results for Lipschitz functions and describe a refinement of the bit extraction technique which could be of independent general interest.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLMs Requires More Than Statistical Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has seen blossoming research in deep learning theory attempting to answer, "Why does deep learning generalize?" A powerful shift in perspective precipitated this progress: the study of overparametrized models in the interpolation regime. In this paper, we argue that another perspective shift is due, since some of the desirable qualities of LLMs are not a consequence of good statistical generalization and require a separate theoretical explanation. Our core argument relies on the observation that AR probabilistic models are inherently non-identifiable: models zero or near-zero KL divergence apart -- thus, equivalent test loss -- can exhibit markedly different behaviors. We support our position with mathematical examples and empirical observations, illustrating why non-identifiability has practical relevance through three case studies: (1) the non-identifiability of zero-shot rule extrapolation; (2) the approximate non-identifiability of in-context learning; and (3) the non-identifiability of fine-tunability. We review promising research directions focusing on LLM-relevant generalization measures, transferability, and inductive biases.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of statistical sequential decision-making: concentration, risk-awareness and modelling in stochastic bandits, with applications to bariatric surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis aims to study some of the mathematical challenges that arise in the analysis of statistical sequential decision-making algorithms for postoperative patients follow-up. Stochastic bandits (multiarmed, contextual) model the learning of a sequence of actions (policy) by an agent in an uncertain environment in order to maximise observed rewards. To learn optimal policies, bandit algorithms have to balance the exploitation of current knowledge and the exploration of uncertain actions. Such algorithms have largely been studied and deployed in industrial applications with large datasets, low-risk decisions and clear modelling assumptions, such as clickthrough rate maximisation in online advertising. By contrast, digital health recommendations call for a whole new paradigm of small samples, risk-averse agents and complex, nonparametric modelling. To this end, we developed new safe, anytime-valid concentration bounds, (Bregman, empirical Chernoff), introduced a new framework for risk-aware contextual bandits (with elicitable risk measures) and analysed a novel class of nonparametric bandit algorithms under weak assumptions (Dirichlet sampling). In addition to the theoretical guarantees, these results are supported by in-depth empirical evidence. Finally, as a first step towards personalised postoperative follow-up recommendations, we developed with medical doctors and surgeons an interpretable machine learning model to predict the long-term weight trajectories of patients after bariatric surgery.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of conformal prediction methods for valid uncertainty quantification in machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, most work in the area of data analysis and machine learning was focused on optimizing predictive models and getting better results than what was possible with existing models. To what extent the metrics with which such improvements were measured were accurately capturing the intended goal, whether the numerical differences in the resulting values were significant, or whether uncertainty played a role in this study and if it should have been taken into account, was of secondary importance. Whereas probability theory, be it frequentist or Bayesian, used to be the gold standard in science before the advent of the supercomputer, it was quickly replaced in favor of black box models and sheer computing power because of their ability to handle large data sets. This evolution sadly happened at the expense of interpretability and trustworthiness. However, while people are still trying to improve the predictive power of their models, the community is starting to realize that for many applications it is not so much the exact prediction that is of importance, but rather the variability or uncertainty.
  The work in this dissertation tries to further the quest for a world where everyone is aware of uncertainty, of how important it is and how to embrace it instead of fearing it. A specific, though general, framework that allows anyone to obtain accurate uncertainty estimates is singled out and analysed. Certain aspects and applications of the framework -- dubbed `conformal prediction' -- are studied in detail. Whereas many approaches to uncertainty quantification make strong assumptions about the data, conformal prediction is, at the time of writing, the only framework that deserves the title `distribution-free'. No parametric assumptions have to be made and the nonparametric results also hold without having to resort to the law of large numbers in the asymptotic regime.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Regret Bounds for Online Learning in Adversarial Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adversarial Markov Decision Process (AMDP) is a learning framework that deals with unknown and varying tasks in decision-making applications like robotics and recommendation systems. A major limitation of the AMDP formalism, however, is pessimistic regret analysis results in the sense that although the cost function can change from one episode to the next, the evolution in many settings is not adversarial. To address this, we introduce and study a new variant of AMDP, which aims to minimize regret while utilizing a set of cost predictors. For this setting, we develop a new policy search method that achieves a sublinear optimistic regret with high probability, that is a regret bound which gracefully degrades with the estimation power of the cost predictors. Establishing such optimistic regret bounds is nontrivial given that (i) as we demonstrate, the existing importance-weighted cost estimators cannot establish optimistic bounds, and (ii) the feedback model of AMDP is different (and more realistic) than the existing optimistic online learning works. Our result, in particular, hinges upon developing a novel optimistically biased cost estimator that leverages cost predictors and enables a high-probability regret analysis without imposing restrictive assumptions. We further discuss practical extensions of the proposed scheme and demonstrate its efficacy numerically.</description>

      <title>Fair Risk Control: A Generalized Framework for Calibrating Multi-group Fairness Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for post-processing machine learning models so that their predictions satisfy multi-group fairness guarantees. Based on the celebrated notion of multicalibration, we introduce $(\mathbf{s},\mathcal{G}, \alpha)-$GMC (Generalized Multi-Dimensional Multicalibration) for multi-dimensional mappings $\mathbf{s}$, constraint set $\mathcal{G}$, and a pre-specified threshold level $\alpha$. We propose associated algorithms to achieve this notion in general settings. This framework is then applied to diverse scenarios encompassing different fairness concerns, including false negative rate control in image segmentation, prediction set conditional uncertainty quantification in hierarchical classification, and de-biased text generation in language models. We conduct numerical studies on several datasets and tasks.</description>

      <title>Unifying and extending Precision Recall metrics for assessing generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the evaluation of generative models has gained a lot of attention. Whereas most generative models are compared in terms of scalar values such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) or Inception Score (IS), in the last years (Sajjadi et al., 2018) proposed a definition of precision-recall curve to characterize the closeness of two distributions. Since then, various approaches to precision and recall have seen the light (Kynkaanniemi et al., 2019; Naeem et al., 2020; Park &amp; Kim, 2023). They center their attention on the extreme values of precision and recall, but apart from this fact, their ties are elusive. In this paper, we unify most of these approaches under the same umbrella, relying on the work of (Simon et al., 2019). Doing so, we were able not only to recover entire curves, but also to expose the sources of the accounted pitfalls of the concerned metrics. We also provide consistency results that go well beyond the ones presented in the corresponding literature. Last, we study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally.</description>

      <title>Optimization without retraction on the random generalized Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization over the set of matrices that satisfy $X^\top B X = I_p$, referred to as the generalized Stiefel manifold, appears in many applications involving sampled covariance matrices such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP). Solving these problems is typically done by iterative methods, such as Riemannian approaches, which require a computationally expensive eigenvalue decomposition involving fully formed $B$. We propose a cheap stochastic iterative method that solves the optimization problem while having access only to a random estimate of the feasible set. Our method does not enforce the constraint in every iteration exactly, but instead it produces iterations that converge to a critical point on the generalized Stiefel manifold defined in expectation. The method has lower per-iteration cost, requires only matrix multiplications, and has the same convergence rates as its Riemannian counterparts involving the full matrix $B$. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various machine learning applications involving generalized orthogonality constraints, including CCA, ICA, and GEVP.</description>

      <title>Minimax Regret Learning for Data with Heterogeneous Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern complex datasets often consist of various sub-populations. To develop robust and generalizable methods in the presence of sub-population heterogeneity, it is important to guarantee a uniform learning performance instead of an average one. In many applications, prior information is often available on which sub-population or group the data points belong to. Given the observed groups of data, we develop a min-max-regret (MMR) learning framework for general supervised learning, which targets to minimize the worst-group regret. Motivated from the regret-based decision theoretic framework, the proposed MMR is distinguished from the value-based or risk-based robust learning methods in the existing literature. The regret criterion features several robustness and invariance properties simultaneously. In terms of generalizability, we develop the theoretical guarantee for the worst-case regret over a super-population of the meta data, which incorporates the observed sub-populations, their mixtures, as well as other unseen sub-populations that could be approximated by the observed ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulation studies and an application to kidney transplantation data from hundreds of transplant centers.</description>

      <title>Robust Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with Conditional Value-at-Risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) have received significant research interest, offering an alternative to standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that often assume fixed transition probabilities. RMDPs address this by optimizing for the worst-case scenarios within ambiguity sets. While earlier studies on RMDPs have largely centered on risk-neutral reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of minimizing expected total discounted costs, in this paper, we analyze the robustness of CVaR-based risk-sensitive RL under RMDP. Firstly, we consider predetermined ambiguity sets. Based on the coherency of CVaR, we establish a connection between robustness and risk sensitivity, thus, techniques in risk-sensitive RL can be adopted to solve the proposed problem. Furthermore, motivated by the existence of decision-dependent uncertainty in real-world problems, we study problems with state-action-dependent ambiguity sets. To solve this, we define a new risk measure named NCVaR and build the equivalence of NCVaR optimization and robust CVaR optimization. We further propose value iteration algorithms and validate our approach in simulation experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a discriminative classifier for compositional data. This classifier is based on the posterior distribution of the Generalized Dirichlet which is the discriminative counterpart of Generalized Dirichlet mixture model. Moreover, following the mixture of experts paradigm, we proposed a hierarchical mixture of this classifier. In order to learn the models parameters, we use a variational approximation by deriving an upper-bound for the Generalized Dirichlet mixture. To the best of our knownledge, this is the first time this bound is proposed in the literature. Experimental results are presented for spam detection and color space identification.</description>

Abstract: A novel approach is given to overcome the computational challenges of the full-matrix Adaptive Gradient algorithm (Full AdaGrad) in stochastic optimization. By developing a recursive method that estimates the inverse of the square root of the covariance of the gradient, alongside a streaming variant for parameter updates, the study offers efficient and practical algorithms for large-scale applications. This innovative strategy significantly reduces the complexity and resource demands typically associated with full-matrix methods, enabling more effective optimization processes. Moreover, the convergence rates of the proposed estimators and their asymptotic efficiency are given. Their effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Distribution Shifts and Uncertainties for Enhanced Model Robustness in Machine Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution shifts, where statistical properties differ between training and test datasets, present a significant challenge in real-world machine learning applications where they directly impact model generalization and robustness. In this study, we explore model adaptation and generalization by utilizing synthetic data to systematically address distributional disparities. Our investigation aims to identify the prerequisites for successful model adaptation across diverse data distributions, while quantifying the associated uncertainties. Specifically, we generate synthetic data using the Van der Waals equation for gases and employ quantitative measures such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon distance, and Mahalanobis distance to assess data similarity. These metrics en able us to evaluate both model accuracy and quantify the associated uncertainty in predictions arising from data distribution shifts. Our findings suggest that utilizing statistical measures, such as the Mahalanobis distance, to determine whether model predictions fall within the low-error "interpolation regime" or the high-error "extrapolation regime" provides a complementary method for assessing distribution shift and model uncertainty. These insights hold significant value for enhancing model robustness and generalization, essential for the successful deployment of machine learning applications in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Perspective on Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods.</description>

      <title>Metalearners for Ranking Treatment Effects</title>

Abstract: Efficiently allocating treatments with a budget constraint constitutes an important challenge across various domains. In marketing, for example, the use of promotions to target potential customers and boost conversions is limited by the available budget. While much research focuses on estimating causal effects, there is relatively limited work on learning to allocate treatments while considering the operational context. Existing methods for uplift modeling or causal inference primarily estimate treatment effects, without considering how this relates to a profit maximizing allocation policy that respects budget constraints. The potential downside of using these methods is that the resulting predictive model is not aligned with the operational context. Therefore, prediction errors are propagated to the optimization of the budget allocation problem, subsequently leading to a suboptimal allocation policy. We propose an alternative approach based on learning to rank. Our proposed methodology directly learns an allocation policy by prioritizing instances in terms of their incremental profit. We propose an efficient sampling procedure for the optimization of the ranking model to scale our methodology to large-scale data sets. Theoretically, we show how learning to rank can maximize the area under a policy's incremental profit curve. Empirically, we validate our methodology and show its effectiveness in practice through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We warn against a common but incomplete understanding of empirical research in machine learning (ML) that leads to non-replicable results, makes findings unreliable, and threatens to undermine progress in the field. To overcome this alarming situation, we call for more awareness of the plurality of ways of gaining knowledge experimentally but also of some epistemic limitations. In particular, we argue most current empirical ML research is fashioned as confirmatory research while it should rather be considered exploratory.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Independence Test in the Presence of Discretization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general theory for adaptive nonparametric estimation of the mean function of a non-stationary and nonlinear time series model using deep neural networks (DNNs). We first consider two types of DNN estimators, non-penalized and sparse-penalized DNN estimators, and establish their generalization error bounds for general non-stationary time series. We then derive minimax lower bounds for estimating mean functions belonging to a wide class of nonlinear autoregressive (AR) models that include nonlinear generalized additive AR, single index, and threshold AR models. Building upon the results, we show that the sparse-penalized DNN estimator is adaptive and attains the minimax optimal rates up to a poly-logarithmic factor for many nonlinear AR models. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the usefulness of the DNN methods for estimating nonlinear AR models with intrinsic low-dimensional structures and discontinuous or rough mean functions, which is consistent with our theory.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Locally Differentially Private Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the contraction properties of locally differentially private mechanisms. More specifically, we derive tight upper bounds on the divergence between $PK$ and $QK$ output distributions of an $\epsilon$-LDP mechanism $K$ in terms of a divergence between the corresponding input distributions $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Our first main technical result presents a sharp upper bound on the $\chi^2$-divergence $\chi^2(PK}\|QK)$ in terms of $\chi^2(P\|Q)$ and $\varepsilon$. We also show that the same result holds for a large family of divergences, including KL-divergence and squared Hellinger distance. The second main technical result gives an upper bound on $\chi^2(PK\|QK)$ in terms of total variation distance $\mathsf{TV}(P, Q)$ and $\epsilon$. We then utilize these bounds to establish locally private versions of the van Trees inequality, Le Cam's, Assouad's, and the mutual information methods, which are powerful tools for bounding minimax estimation risks. These results are shown to lead to better privacy analyses than the state-of-the-arts in several statistical problems such as entropy and discrete distribution estimation, non-parametric density estimation, and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>A Black-box Approach for Non-stationary Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate learning the equilibria in non-stationary multi-agent systems and address the challenges that differentiate multi-agent learning from single-agent learning. Specifically, we focus on games with bandit feedback, where testing an equilibrium can result in substantial regret even when the gap to be tested is small, and the existence of multiple optimal solutions (equilibria) in stationary games poses extra challenges. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a versatile black-box approach applicable to a broad spectrum of problems, such as general-sum games, potential games, and Markov games, when equipped with appropriate learning and testing oracles for stationary environments. Our algorithms can achieve $\widetilde{O}\left(\Delta^{1/4}T^{3/4}\right)$ regret when the degree of nonstationarity, as measured by total variation $\Delta$, is known, and $\widetilde{O}\left(\Delta^{1/5}T^{4/5}\right)$ regret when $\Delta$ is unknown, where $T$ is the number of rounds. Meanwhile, our algorithm inherits the favorable dependence on number of agents from the oracles. As a side contribution that may be independent of interest, we show how to test for various types of equilibria by a black-box reduction to single-agent learning, which includes Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, and coarse correlated equilibria.</description>

      <title>Corruptions of Supervised Learning Problems: Typology and Mitigations</title>

Abstract: Corruption is notoriously widespread in data collection. Despite extensive research, the existing literature on corruption predominantly focuses on specific settings and learning scenarios, lacking a unified view. There is still a limited understanding of how to effectively model and mitigate corruption in machine learning problems. In this work, we develop a general theory of corruption from an information-theoretic perspective - with Markov kernels as a foundational mathematical tool. We generalize the definition of corruption beyond the concept of distributional shift: corruption includes all modifications of a learning problem, including changes in model class and loss function. We will focus here on changes in probability distributions. First, we construct a provably exhaustive framework for pairwise Markovian corruptions. The framework not only allows us to study corruption types based on their input space, but also serves to unify prior works on specific corruption models and establish a consistent nomenclature. Second, we systematically analyze the consequences of corruption on learning tasks by comparing Bayes risks in the clean and corrupted scenarios. This examination sheds light on complexities arising from joint and dependent corruptions on both labels and attributes. Notably, while label corruptions affect only the loss function, more intricate cases involving attribute corruptions extend the influence beyond the loss to affect the hypothesis class. Third, building upon these results, we investigate mitigations for various corruption types. We expand the existing loss-correction results for label corruption, and identify the necessity to generalize the classical corruption-corrected learning framework to a new paradigm with weaker requirements. Within the latter setting, we provide a negative result for loss correction in the attribute and the joint corruption case.</description>

      <title>Decolonial AI Alignment: Openness, Vi\'{s}e\d{s}a-Dharma, and Including Excluded Knowledges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior work has explicated the coloniality of artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment through mechanisms such as extractivism, automation, sociological essentialism, surveillance, and containment. However, that work has not engaged much with alignment: teaching behaviors to a large language model (LLM) in line with desired values, and has not considered a mechanism that arises within that process: moral absolutism -- a part of the coloniality of knowledge. Colonialism has a history of altering the beliefs and values of colonized peoples; in this paper, I argue that this history is recapitulated in current LLM alignment practices and technologies. Furthermore, I suggest that AI alignment be decolonialized using three forms of openness: openness of models, openness to society, and openness to excluded knowledges. This suggested approach to decolonial AI alignment uses ideas from the argumentative moral philosophical tradition of Hinduism, which has been described as an open-source religion. One concept used is vi\'{s}e\d{s}a-dharma, or particular context-specific notions of right and wrong. At the end of the paper, I provide a suggested reference architecture to work toward the proposed framework.</description>

Abstract: Goal-conditioned policies are generally understood to be "feed-forward" circuits, in the form of neural networks that map from the current state and the goal specification to the next action to take. However, under what circumstances such a policy can be learned and how efficient the policy will be are not well understood. In this paper, we present a circuit complexity analysis for relational neural networks (such as graph neural networks and transformers) representing policies for planning problems, by drawing connections with serialized goal regression search (S-GRS). We show that there are three general classes of planning problems, in terms of the growth of circuit width and depth as a function of the number of objects and planning horizon, providing constructive proofs. We also illustrate the utility of this analysis for designing neural networks for policy learning.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Phylogenetic Trees via Split-Weight Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning has become a staple in classical machine learning, successfully identifying clustering patterns in data across a broad range of domain applications. Surprisingly, despite its accuracy and elegant simplicity, unsupervised learning has not been sufficiently exploited in the realm of phylogenetic tree inference. The main reason for the delay in adoption of unsupervised learning in phylogenetics is the lack of a meaningful, yet simple, way of embedding phylogenetic trees into a vector space. Here, we propose the simple yet powerful split-weight embedding which allows us to fit standard clustering algorithms to the space of phylogenetic trees. We show that our split-weight embedded clustering is able to recover meaningful evolutionary relationships in simulated and real (Adansonia baobabs) data.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Differential Feature Under-reporting on Algorithmic Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive risk models in the public sector are commonly developed using administrative data that is more complete for subpopulations that more greatly rely on public services. In the United States, for instance, information on health care utilization is routinely available to government agencies for individuals supported by Medicaid and Medicare, but not for the privately insured. Critiques of public sector algorithms have identified such differential feature under-reporting as a driver of disparities in algorithmic decision-making. Yet this form of data bias remains understudied from a technical viewpoint. While prior work has examined the fairness impacts of additive feature noise and features that are clearly marked as missing, the setting of data missingness absent indicators (i.e. differential feature under-reporting) has been lacking in research attention. In this work, we present an analytically tractable model of differential feature under-reporting which we then use to characterize the impact of this kind of data bias on algorithmic fairness. We demonstrate how standard missing data methods typically fail to mitigate bias in this setting, and propose a new set of methods specifically tailored to differential feature under-reporting. Our results show that, in real world data settings, under-reporting typically leads to increasing disparities. The proposed solution methods show success in mitigating increases in unfairness.</description>

Abstract: Statistical learning theory is the foundation of machine learning, providing theoretical bounds for the risk of models learnt from a (single) training set, assumed to issue from an unknown probability distribution. In actual deployment, however, the data distribution may (and often does) vary, causing domain adaptation/generalization issues. In this paper we lay the foundations for a `credal' theory of learning, using convex sets of probabilities (credal sets) to model the variability in the data-generating distribution. Such credal sets, we argue, may be inferred from a finite sample of training sets. Bounds are derived for the case of finite hypotheses spaces (both assuming realizability or not) as well as infinite model spaces, which directly generalize classical results.</description>

      <title>Learning Action-based Representations Using Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning agents using high-dimensional observations must be able to identify relevant state features amidst many exogeneous distractors. A representation that captures controllability identifies these state elements by determining what affects agent control. While methods such as inverse dynamics and mutual information capture controllability for a limited number of timesteps, capturing long-horizon elements remains a challenging problem. Myopic controllability can capture the moment right before an agent crashes into a wall, but not the control-relevance of the wall while the agent is still some distance away. To address this we introduce action-bisimulation encoding, a method inspired by the bisimulation invariance pseudometric, that extends single-step controllability with a recursive invariance constraint. By doing this, action-bisimulation learns a multi-step controllability metric that smoothly discounts distant state features that are relevant for control. We demonstrate that action-bisimulation pretraining on reward-free, uniformly random data improves sample efficiency in several environments, including a photorealistic 3D simulation domain, Habitat. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis and qualitative results demonstrating the information captured by action-bisimulation.</description>

      <title>The Privacy Power of Correlated Noise in Decentralized Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning is appealing as it enables the scalable usage of large amounts of distributed data and resources (without resorting to any central entity), while promoting privacy since every user minimizes the direct exposure of their data. Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor, a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially, in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion SecLDP privacy accountant for public use.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Feature Extraction and Classification Layers for Calibrated Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have shown great promise in many classification applications, yet are widely known to have poorly calibrated predictions when they are over-parametrized. Improving DNN calibration without comprising on model accuracy is of extreme importance and interest in safety critical applications such as in the health-care sector. In this work, we show that decoupling the training of feature extraction layers and classification layers in over-parametrized DNN architectures such as Wide Residual Networks (WRN) and Visual Transformers (ViT) significantly improves model calibration whilst retaining accuracy, and at a low training cost. In addition, we show that placing a Gaussian prior on the last hidden layer outputs of a DNN, and training the model variationally in the classification training stage, even further improves calibration. We illustrate these methods improve calibration across ViT and WRN architectures for several image classification benchmark datasets.</description>

This paper seamlessly integrates mirror descent-based variational inference into Gaussian process-based few-shot classification, addressing the challenge of non-conjugate inference. By leveraging non-Euclidean geometry, mirror descent achieves accelerated convergence by providing the steepest descent direction along the corresponding manifold. It also exhibits the parameterization invariance property concerning the variational distribution. Experimental results demonstrate competitive classification accuracy, improved uncertainty quantification, and faster convergence compared to baseline models. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameters and components. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/keanson/MD-BSFC.</description>
