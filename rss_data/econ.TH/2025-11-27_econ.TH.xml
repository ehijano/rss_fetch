      <title>Asylum Assignment and Burden-Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of matching asylum seekers to member states, incorporating wait times, preferences of asylum seekers, and the priorities, capacities, and burden-sharing commitments of member states. We identify a unique choice rule that addresses feasibility while balancing priorities and capacities. We examine the effects of both homogeneous and heterogeneous burden-sizes among asylum seekers on the matching process. Our main result shows that when all asylum seekers are treated as having identical burden-sizes, the asylum-seeker-proposing cumulative offer mechanism guarantees both stability and strategy-proofness. In contrast, when burden-sizes vary, there are scenarios where achieving stability or strategy-proofness is no longer possible.</description>

      <title>Consistent solutions to the allocation of indivisible objects with general endowments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the consistency principle to examine various core concepts in a general allocation model that subsumes several familiar market design models as special cases. The conventional strong core is consistent but may be empty, whereas the exclusion core proposed by Balbuzanov and Kotowski (2019), although nonempty, is not consistent and may include unintuitive allocations. We therefore propose a refinement of the exclusion core, which is both nonempty and consistent. Our solution offers sharper predictions than existing alternatives and coincides with the strong core and/or the exclusion core in special cases that generalize familiar models.</description>

      <title>On the core of the Shapley-Scarf housing market model with full preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine core concepts in the classical model of \cite{shapley1974cores} under full preferences. Among the standard notions, the strong core may be empty, whereas the weak core, though always nonempty, can be overly large and include unreasonable allocations. Our main findings are: (1) The exclusion core of Balbuzanov and Kotowski (2019) -- a recent concept shown to outperform standard cores in complex environments under strict preferences -- can also be empty. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for its nonemptiness, showing that it is more often nonempty than the strong core. (2) We introduce two new core concepts, built on the exclusion core and the strong core respectively, by refining the assumptions on how indifferent agents may block. Both are nonempty and Pareto efficient, and coincide with the strong core whenever the latter is nonempty. (3) These core concepts are ordered by set inclusion, with the strong core as the smallest and the weak core as the largest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a unified approach to characterize the set of all feasible signals subject to privacy constraints. The Blackwell frontier of feasible signals can be decomposed into minimum informative signals achieving the Blackwell frontier of privacy variables, and conditionally privacy-preserving signals. A complete characterization of the minimum informative signals is then provided. We apply the framework to ex-post privacy (including differential and inferential privacy) and to constraints on posterior means of arbitrary statistics.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Storage in a Power System with Stochastic Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric power systems are increasingly turning to energy storage systems to balance supply and demand. But how much storage is required? What is the optimal volume of storage in a power system and on what does it depend? In addition, what form of hedge contracts do storage facilities require? We answer these questions in the special case in which the uncertainty in the power system involves successive draws of an independent, identically-distributed random variable. We characterize the conditions for the optimal operation of, and investment in, storage and show how these conditions can be understood graphically using price-duration curves. We also characterize the optimal hedge contracts for storage units.</description>

      <title>Discrete Choice with Endogenous Peer Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a continuous-time peer-effect discrete choice model where peers that affect the preferences of a given agent are randomly selected based on their previous choices. We characterize the equilibrium behavior and study the empirical content of the model. In the model, changes in the choices of peers affect both the set of peers the agent pays attention to and her preferences over the alternatives. We exploit variation in choices coupled with variation in the size of the set of potential peers to recover agents' preferences and the peer selection mechanism. These nonparametric identification results do not rely on exogenous variation of covariates.</description>

Abstract: This paper unifies two foundational constructs from economics and algorithmic game theory, the Arctic Auction and the linear Fisher market, to address the efficient allocation of differentiated goods in complex markets. Our main contributions are showing that an equilibrium for the Arctic Auction is captured by a Rational Convex Program, and deriving the first combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm for computing Arctic Auction equilibria.</description>

      <title>Strategic Attribute Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A researcher allocates a budget of informative tests across multiple unknown attributes to influence a decision-maker. We derive the researcher's equilibrium learning strategy by solving an auxiliary single-player problem. The attribute weights in this problem depend on how much the researcher and the decision-maker disagree. If the researcher expects an excessive response to new information, she forgoes learning altogether. In an organizational context, we show that a manager favors more diverse analysts as the hierarchical distance grows. In another application, we show how an appropriately opposed advisor can constrain a discriminatory politician, and identify the welfare-inequality Pareto frontier of researchers.</description>

      <title>Bundled School Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel school choice system where schools are grouped into hierarchical bundles and offered to students as options for preference reports. By listing a bundle, a student seeks admission to any school within it without ranking the schools. This approach helps students who struggle to rank schools precisely and expands options on limited preference lists, potentially improving match outcomes. We design a modified deferred acceptance mechanism to handle bundle reports while preserving stability. Two laboratory experiments support our theory, showing that well-constructed bundles aligned with student preferences enhance welfare and match rates without compromising fairness. Practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Screening with damages and ordeals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A welfare-maximizing designer allocates two kinds of goods using two wasteful screening instruments: ordeals, which enter agents' utilities additively, and damages, which harm agents in proportion to their values for the goods. If agents have common valuations for one of the goods, damages always lead to Pareto-dominated mechanisms: any allocation using damages can also be implemented with ordeals alone, while also leaving greater rents to inframarginal types. However, using damages can be optimal when agents' valuations for both goods are heterogeneous: with multidimensional types, the two devices differ in how they sort agents into available options, with the optimal sorting sometimes requiring the use of damages. I nevertheless identify distributional conditions under which using damages is not optimal. In those cases, the optimal mechanism produces an efficient allocation by posting "market-clearing" ordeals for each type of good.</description>

      <title>Modelling Asset Price Dynamics with Investor Inertia: Diffusion with Advection and Fourth-Order Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard models of asset price dynamics, such as geometric Brownian motion (see, for example, Osborne, 1959, Samuelson, 2016), do not formally incorporate investor inertia. This paper presents a two-stage framework for modelling this behaviour. First, we establish a microfoundation for the classic diffusion-with-advection model by representing the asset's log price as a three-state random walk (up, down or neutral). While this derivation offers a clear behavioural origin for drift and volatility, it is ultimately limited by its Gaussian nature and fails to capture the heavy tails (leptokurtosis) observed in financial markets. To address this issue, we introduce and apply a fourth-order extension inspired by diffusion-with-retention models (Bevilacqua, 2011), where a more complex representation of inertia generates non-Gaussian dynamics. Through an empirical application using Brazilian PETR4.SA data, we demonstrate that this extended model significantly outperforms the original in fitting the real distribution of returns. Our findings suggest that investor inertia is a dual concept capable of explaining both standard market trends and extreme events.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mediation and Moral Hazard: From Private To Public Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I characterize optimal mediation dynamics with fixed discounting in a moral hazard model between a long-lived worker and short-lived clients. I identify a structural transition: optimal mediation initially prescribes private communication and eventually switches to public communication. In early periods, optimal mediation creates information asymmetry between the worker and the clients by secretly randomizing between allowing the worker to shirk without penalty and requiring effort with minimal punishment following underperformance. Eventually, these randomizations disappear and optimal mediation prescribes public communication that induces standard carrot-and-stick incentives.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mechanism Collapse: A Boundary Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When are dynamics valuable? In Bayesian environments with public signals and no intertemporal commitment, we study a seller who allocates an economically single-shot resource over time. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which the optimal dynamic mechanism collapses to a simple terminal design: a single public experiment at date 0 followed by a posterior-dependent static mechanism executed at a deterministic date, with no further disclosure. The key condition is the existence of a global affine shadow value that supports the posterior-based revenue frontier and uniformly bounds all history-dependent revenues. When this condition fails, a collapse statistic pinpoints the dates and public state variables that generate genuine dynamic value. The characterization combines martingale concavification on the belief space with an affine-support duality for concave envelopes.</description>

      <title>Superiority of Instantaneous Decisions in Thin Dynamic Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dynamic matching setting where homogeneous agents arrive at random according to a Poisson process and randomly form edges yielding a sparse market. Agents stay in the market according to a certain sojourn time and wait to be matched with a compatible agent by a matching algorithm. When their maximum sojourn time is reached, they perish unmatched. The primary objective is to maximize the number of matched agents. Our main result is to show that a uniformly guaranteed sojourn time suffices to get almost optimal performance of instantaneous matching. Interestingly, this matching policy essentially keeps as few agents in the market as possible. Hence, in contrast to the common paradigm that market thickness is the crucial property for obtaining strong matching performance, we show that the agents' sojourn behavior can be an equally powerful factor. In addition, instantaneous matching is close to optimal with respect to minimizing waiting time. We develop new techniques for proving our results going beyond commonly adopted methods for Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>
