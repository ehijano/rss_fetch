      <title>Mechanical Characterization of Brain Tissue: Experimental Techniques, Human Testing Considerations, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical behavior of brain tissue is crucial for advancing both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Yet, accurately measuring these properties remains challenging due to the brain unique mechanical attributes and complex anatomical structures. This review provides a comprehensive overview of commonly used techniques for characterizing brain tissue mechanical properties, covering both invasive methods such as atomic force microscopy, indentation, axial mechanical testing, and oscillatory shear testing and noninvasive approaches like magnetic resonance elastography and ultrasound elastography. Each technique is evaluated in terms of working principles, applicability, representative studies, and experimental limitations. We further summarize existing publications that have used these techniques to measure human brain tissue mechanical properties. With a primary focus on invasive studies, we systematically compare their sample preparation, testing conditions, reported mechanical parameters, and modeling strategies. Key sensitivity factors influencing testing outcomes (e.g., sample size, anatomical location, strain rate, temperature, conditioning, and post-mortem interval) are also discussed. Additionally, selected noninvasive studies are reviewed to assess their potential for in vivo characterization. A comparative discussion between invasive and noninvasive methods, as well as in vivo versus ex vivo testing, is included. This review aims to offer practical guidance for researchers and clinicians in selecting appropriate mechanical testing approaches and contributes a curated dataset to support constitutive modeling of human brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Hybrid artificial intelligence echogenic components-based diagnosis of adnexal masses on ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Adnexal masses are heterogeneous and have varied sonographic presentations, making them difficult to diagnose correctly. Purpose: Our study aimed to develop an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence/computer aided diagnosis (AI/CADx)-based pipeline to distinguish between benign and malignant adnexal masses on ultrasound imaging based upon automatic segmentation and echogenic-based classification. Methods: The retrospective study was conducted on a consecutive dataset of patients with an adnexal mass. There was one image per mass. Mass borders were segmented from the background via a supervised U-net algorithm. Masses were spatially subdivided automatically into their hypo- and hyper-echogenic components by a physics-driven unsupervised clustering algorithm. The dataset was separated by patient into a training/validation set (95 masses; 70%) and an independent held-out test set (41 masses; 30%). Eight component-based radiomic features plus a binary measure of the presence or absence of solid components were used to train a linear discriminant analysis classifier to distinguish between malignant and benign masses. Classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), along with sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and accuracy at target 95% sensitivity. Results: The cohort included 133 patients with 136 adnexal masses. In distinguishing between malignant and benign masses, the pipeline achieved an AUC of 0.90 [0.84, 0.95] on the training/validation set and 0.93 [0.83, 0.98] on the independent test set. Strong diagnostic performance was observed at the target 95% sensitivity. Conclusions: A novel hybrid AI/CADx echogenic components-based ultrasound imaging pipeline can distinguish between malignant and benign adnexal masses with strong diagnostic performance.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for flow-compatible reconstruction of heart motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of cardiac chamber motion from time-resolved medical imaging modalities is of growing interest in both the clinical and biomechanical fields. Despite recent advancement, the cardiac motion reconstruction process remains complex and prone to uncertainties. Moreover, traditional assessments often focus on static comparisons, lacking assurances of dynamic consistency and physical relevance. This work introduces a novel paradigm of flow-compatible motion reconstruction, integrating anatomical imaging with flow data to ensure adherence to fundamental physical principles, such as mass and momentum conservation. The approach is demonstrated in the context of right ventricular motion, utilizing diffeomorphic mappings and multi-slice MRI to achieve dynamically consistent and physically robust reconstructions. Results show that enforcing flow compatibility within the reconstruction process is feasible and enhances the physical realism of the resulting kinematics.</description>

      <title>Artifacts in Photoacoustic Imaging: Origins and Mitigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is rapidly moving from the laboratory to the clinic, increasing the need to understand confounders which might adversely affect patient care. Over the past five years, landmark studies have shown the clinical utility of PAI, leading to regulatory approval of several devices. In this article, we describe the various causes of artifacts in PAI, providing schematic overviews and practical examples, simulated as well as experimental. This work serves two purposes: (1) educating clinical users to identify artifacts, understand their causes, and assess whether their impact, and (2) providing a reference of the limitations of current systems for those working to improve them. We explain how two aspects of PAI systems lead to artifacts: their inability to measure complete data sets, and embedded assumptions during reconstruction. We describe the physics underlying PAI, and propose a classification of the artifacts. The paper concludes by discussing possible advanced mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Chebyshev Reconstruction for the Anisotropic Equilibrium Model in Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging modality capable of real-time, high-sensitivity mapping of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Mesh-Informed Reduced Order Models for Aneurysm Rupture Risk Prediction</title>

Abstract: The complexity of the cardiovascular system needs to be accurately reproduced in order to promptly acknowledge health conditions; to this aim, advanced multifidelity and multiphysics numerical models are crucial. On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Molecular MRI Quantification using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biophysical model fitting plays a key role in obtaining quantitative parameters from physiological signals and images. However, the model complexity for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often translates into excessive computation time, which makes clinical use impractical. Here, we present a generic computational approach for solving the parameter extraction inverse problem posed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling coupled with experimental measurement of the system dynamics. This is achieved by formulating a numerical ODE solver to function as a step-wise analytical one, thereby making it compatible with automatic differentiation-based optimization. This enables efficient gradient-based model fitting, and provides a new approach to parameter quantification based on self-supervised learning from a single data observation. The neural-network-based train-by-fit pipeline was used to quantify semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) amide proton exchange parameters in the human brain, in an in-vivo molecular MRI study (n = 4). The entire pipeline of the first whole brain quantification was completed in 18.3 $\pm$ 8.3 minutes. Reusing the single-subject-trained network for inference in new subjects took 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 s, to provide results in agreement with literature values and scan-specific fit results.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Compton-PET Imaging for ion-range verification:A Preclinical Study for Proton-, Helium-, and Carbon-Therapy at HIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced-accuracy ion-range verification in real time shall enable a significant step forward in the use of therapeutic ion beams. Positron-emission tomography (PET) and prompt-gamma imaging (PGI) are two of the most promising and researched methodologies, both of them with their own advantages and challenges. Thus far, both of them have been explored for ion-range verification in an independent way. However, the simultaneous combination of PET and PGI within the same imaging framework may open-up the possibility to exploit more efficiently all radiative emissions excited in the tissue by the ion beam. Here we report on the first pre-clinical implementation of an hybrid PET-PGI imaging system, hereby exploring its performance over several ion-beam species (H, He and C), energies (55 MeV to 275 MeV) and intensities (10$^7$-10$^9$ ions/spot), which are representative of clinical conditions. The measurements were carried out using the pencil-beam scanning technique at the synchrotron accelerator of the Heavy Ion Therapy centre in Heidelberg utilizing an array of four Compton cameras in a twofold front-to-front configuration. The results demonstrate that the hybrid PET-PGI technique can be well suited for relatively low energies (55-155 MeV) and beams of protons. On the other hand, for heavier beams of helium and carbon ions at higher energies (155-275 MeV), range monitoring becomes more challenging owing to large backgrounds from additional nuclear processes. The experimental results are well understood on the basis of realistic Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, which show a satisfactory agreement with the measured data. This work can guide further upgrades of the hybrid PET-PGI system towards a clinical implementation of this innovative technique.</description>

      <title>Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT Using Two Orthogonal Projection Views: A Phantom Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel imaging and reconstruction framework for dual-energy cone-beam CT (DECBCT) using only two orthogonal X-ray projections at different energy levels (2V-DECBCT). The goal is to enable fast and low-dose DE volumetric imaging with high spectral fidelity and structural accuracy, suitable for DECBCT-guided radiation therapy. We introduce a framework for 2V-DECBCT based on physics-informed dual-domain diffusion models. A cycle-domain training strategy is employed to enforce consistency between projection and volume reconstructions through a differentiable physics-informed module. Furthermore, a spectral-consistency loss is introduced to preserve inter-energy contrast during the generative process. The model is trained and evaluated using 4D XCAT phantom data under realistic anatomical motion. The method produces high-fidelity DECBCT volumes from only two views, accurately preserving anatomical boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Subtraction maps computed from the reconstructed energy volumes show strong visual and numerical agreement with ground truth. This work presents the first diffusion model-based framework for 2V-DECBCT reconstruction, demonstrating accurate structural and spectral recovery from extremely sparse inputs.</description>
