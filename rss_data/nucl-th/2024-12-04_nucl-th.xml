      <title>Constraint on initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding fluids from nonlinear causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are scrutinized in terms of nonlinear causality of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Conventionally, it is believed that the matter generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions starts to behave as a fluid all at once at some initial time. However, it is by no means trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei the fluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinear causality at large departures from local equilibrium. We therefore quantify the inverse Reynolds number to justify the hydrodynamic description to be valid. The initial conditions are strictly constrained not to violate the causality conditions during the time evolution. With the help of the transverse energies per rapidity measured at RHIC and LHC, we obtain the minimum initial proper time and the maximum energy density allowed by nonlinear causality. This analysis strongly suggests that the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions needs to be described by a non-equilibrium description other than the framework of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Ladder equation for the three-particle vertex and its approximate solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the three two-particle Bethe-Salpeter equations to ten three-particle ladders. These equations are exact and yield the exact three-particle vertex, if we knew the three-particle vertex irreducible in one of the ten channels. However, as we do not have this three-particle irreducible vertex at hand, we approximate this building block for the ladder by the sum of two-particle irreducible vertices each connecting two fermionic lines. The comparison to the exact solution shows that this approximation is only good for rather weak interactions and even than only qualitatively - at least for the non-linear response function analyzed.</description>

      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the corresponding lattice QCD Hamiltonian. This method is equivalent to the Lanczos procedure introduced recently (Wagman-2024), but more general and simpler to implement. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by calculating the two lowest energy levels of a large number of hadrons including a few nuclei. While the signal-to-noise problem does not improve significantly, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable, compared to those extracted by conventional methods. Within a given statistical dataset the proposed method can effectively account for both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the fitting window, and hence can reliably be employed in lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thorough account of electromagnetic interactions of massive Dirac neutrinos as well as their spin-flavor state in the theoretical formulation of elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering is given. The formalism of neutrino charge, magnetic, electric, and anapole form factors defined as matrices in the mass basis is employed under the assumption of three-neutrino mixing. The flavor and spin change of neutrinos propagating from the source to the detector is taken into account in the form of a spin-flavor density matrix of the neutrino arriving at the detector. The potential effects of the neutrino charge radii, magnetic moments, and spin polarization in the neutrino-nucleon scattering experiments are outlined.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Soft QCD Physics at the LHC: highlights and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Switzerland became operational in 2009 and has since then produced a plethora of results for proton-proton (pp) collisions. This short review covers results that relates to soft QCD focusing on non-diffractive physics at mid-rapidity. Most of the presented results comes from transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra and related/derived observables such as multiplicity, $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ and ratios, but also the observed ``ridge'' and the questions of quark-gluon plasma in pp collisions will be discussed. The goal of the review is on one hand to introduce the topics and provide references for scientists joining the LHC program while at the same time highlighting what we consider the most interesting results and open questions to inspire novel measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new isomeric $(4^-)$ state at 285.5(32) keV in $^{162}$Tb was reported by R. Orford et al. [Phys. Rev. C 102, 011303(R) (2020)] based on a Penning-trap mass measurement. Here we show that this result is not compatible with existing experimental data. The state identified as $^{162}$Tb$^{m}$ with a mass-excess value of $-65593.9(25)$ keV is actually the $1^-$ ground state. The state identified as the ground state of $^{162}$Tb is most likely a molecular contaminant with the same mass-over-charge ratio.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Corrections to the CBF Effective Nuclear Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the inclusion of relativistic boost corrections into the CBF effective nuclear Hamiltonian, derived from a realistic model of two- and three-nucleon interactions using the formalism of correlated basis functions and the cluster expansion technique. Different procedures to take into account the effects of boost interactions are compared on the basis of the ability to reproduce the nuclear matter equation of state obtained from accurate many-body calculations. The results of our study show that the repulsive contribution of the boost interaction significantly depends on the underlying model of the non relativistic potential. On the other hand, the dominant relativistic correction turns out to be the corresponding reduction of the strength of repulsive three-nucleon interactions, leading to a significant softening of the equation of state at supranuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Universal bound states and resonances with Coulomb plus short-range potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study charged particles in three dimensions interacting via a short-range potential in addition to the Coulomb potential. When the Bohr radius and the scattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics of the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We develop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of the Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal their bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a repulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with increasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for an attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length. The zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at infinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles induced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances shorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas shallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of $\Delta$-isobars on Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We include the $\Delta$-isobars in the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star (NS) and study its effects with various parameter sets of the RMF model. We compare our results with the NS's constraints from the mass-radius measurement of PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0952-0607, and tidal deformability of GW170817. We calculate the mass-radius profile and tidal deformabilities of the NS using 21 parameter sets of the RMF model.Analyzing the result with various parameters, it is clear that only few parameter sets can satisfy simultaneously the constraints from NICER and GW170817. NLD parameter set satisfy all the constraints of NICER and GW170817. For its strong predictive power for the bulk properties of the neutron star, we take NLD parameter set as a representative for the detailed calculation of effect of $\Delta$-isobar on neutron star properties. We demonstrate that it is possible that $\Delta$-isobar can produce at 2-3 times the saturation density by adjusting the coupling constants $X_{\sigma\Delta}$, $X_{\rho\Delta}$ and $X_{\omega\Delta}$ in an appropriate range. Bulk properties of the NS like mass-radius profile and tidal deformability is strongly affected by the interaction strength of $\Delta$-isobar. Our calculation shows that it is also possible that by choosing $X_{\sigma\Delta}$, $X_{\rho\Delta}$ and $X_{\omega\Delta}$ to a suitable range the threshold density of $\Delta^-$-isobar become lower than $\Lambda^0$ hyperon. For a particular value of $\Delta$-coupling constants, the $R_{1.4}$ decrease by 1.7 km. This manuscipt give an argumentative justification for allowing $\Delta$-isobar degrees of freedom in the calculation of the NS properties.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum Distributions from Lattice QCD without Wilson Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs), which are defined by gauge-invariant 3D parton correlators with staple-shaped lightlike Wilson lines, can be calculated from quark and gluon correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge on a Euclidean lattice. These quantities can be expressed gauge-invariantly as the correlators of Coulomb-gauge-dressed fields, which reduce to the standard TMD correlators under principal-value prescription in the infinite boost limit. In the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory, a quasi-TMD defined from such correlators in a large-momentum hadron state can be matched to the TMD via a factorization formula, whose exact form is derived using Soft Collinear Effective Theory and verified at one-loop order. Compared to the currently used gauge-invariant correlators, this new method can substantially improve statistical precision and simplify renormalization for the time-reversal-even TMDs, which will greatly enhance the predicative power of lattice QCD in the non-perturbative region.</description>

      <title>Roberge-Weiss periodicity and singularity in hadron resonance gas model with excluded volume effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with pure imaginary baryon number chemical potential mu =i theta T, where T is temperature and theta is a real number, has the Roberge-Weiss periodicity. We study the theta-dependence of the baryon number density and the pressure in the hadron resonance gas model with excluded volume effects of baryons. It is shown that the baryon number density and the pressure are smooth periodic functions of theta at low or high temperature. However, they have singular behavior at theta =(2k+1)pi where k is an integer, when T sim 211MeV. This temperature is consistent with the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW obtained by lattice QCD simulations. This singularity can be explained by the dual excluded volume effects in which the roles of point-like and non point-like particles are exchanged each other in the ordinary excluded volume effects. It is also indicated that the excluded volume effect is visible just below TRW and is directly detectable by the lattice QCD simulation at finite theta. We compare the results with the one obtained by the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy with L\'evy sources from SPS through RHIC to LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtoscopy is a unique tool to investigate the space-time geometry of the matter created in ultra-relativistic collisions. If the probability density distribution of hadron emission is parametrized, then the dependence of its parameters on particle momentum, collision energy, and collision geometry can be given. In recent years, several measurements came to light that indicated the adequacy of assuming a L\'evy-stable shape for the mentioned distribution. In parallel, several new phenomenological developments appeared, aiding the interpretation of the experimental results or providing tools for the measurements. In this paper, we discuss important aspects of femtoscopy with L\'evy sources in light of some of these advances, including phenomenological and experimental ones.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>A new method to clarify contribution of chiral magnetic effect in small collision system $p^{\uparrow} + A$ involving a transversely polarized proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new experiment method to check contribution of chiral magnetic effect (CME). With experimental data of DIS involving transversely polarized proton, we have calculated the 3-D charge density inside the polarized proton, which is found to have a significant violation to spherical symmetry. Then we have calculated the property of electromagnetic field (E-M field) generated by a single transversely polarized proton ($p^{\uparrow}$). Based on them, the E-M field generated in small collision system $p^{\uparrow}+A$ are studied. We find that the orientation of this E-M field has a significant dependence on the polarization direction of the proton, and the correlator ($\Delta\gamma$ ) has also significant dependence on the angle between reaction plane and polarization direction. As background contribution are canceled comparing two collision geometry schemes, only contribution of CME is remained.</description>
