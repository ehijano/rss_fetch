      <title>Methodology for Analyzing Proton Multiplicity Fluctuations with Azimuthal Partitions in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary objective in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is to investigate the phase transition between confined and deconfined color matter. Complementary to the cumulants of conserved charges integrated over the full azimuth, we introduce a novel experimental approach to explore particle fluctuations in azimuthal partitions, which are potentially sensitive to the first-order phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. We evaluate proton multiplicity ($N_w$) fluctuations in azimuthal partitions of width $w$ to quantitatively estimate the clustering tendency among these protons. The $\Delta \sigma^2$ observable is defined as the normalized difference between the variance of the $N_w$ distribution and the binomial baseline. We demonstrate the feasibility and characteristics of this observable through simulations using the AMPT and MUSIC+FIST models. We also use a Gaussian correlation model to illustrate that the dependence of $\Delta \sigma^2$ on $w$ can be parameterized to accurately extract the strength and the range of the input interaction among protons.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature equations of state of compact stars with hyperons: three-dimensional tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct tables of finite temperature equation of state (EoS) of hypernuclear matter in the range of densities, temperatures, and electron fractions that are needed for numerical simulations of supernovas, proto-neutron stars, and binary neutron star mergers and cast them in the format of {\sc CompOSE} database. The tables are extracted from a model that is based on covariant density functional (CDF) theory that includes the full $J^P=1/2^+$ baryon octet in a manner that is consistent with the current astrophysical and nuclear constraints. We employ a parameterization with three different values of the slope of the symmetry energy $\Lsym=30$, 50 and 70 MeV and fixed skewness $\Qsat= 400$ MeV for above saturation matter. A model for the EoS of inhomogeneous matter is matched at sub-saturation density to the high-density hypernuclear EoS. We discuss the generic features of the resulting EoS and the composition of matter as a function of density, temperature, and electron fraction. The nuclear characteristics and strangeness fraction of these models are compared to the alternatives from the literature. The integral properties of static and rapidly rotating compact stars in the limit of zero temperature are discussed and confronted with the multimessenger astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Study of the alpha-particle monopole transition form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4He monopole form factor is studied by computing the transition matrix element of the electromagnetic charge operator between the 4He ground-state and the p+3H and n+3He scattering states. The nuclear wave functions are calculated using the hyperspherical harmonic method, by starting from Hamiltonians including two- and three-body forces derived in chiral effective field theory. The electromagnetic charge operator retains, beyond the leading order (impulse approximation) term, also higher order contributions, as relativistic corrections and meson-exchange currents. The results for the monopole form factor are in fairly agreement with recent MAMI data. Comparison with other theoretical calculations are also provided.</description>

      <title>Antinucleon-nucleon interactions in covariant chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress in developing high-precision relativistic chiral nucleon-nucleon interactions, we study the antinucleon-nucleon interaction at the leading order in the covariant chiral effective field theory. The phase shifts and inelasticities with $J\leq 1$ are obtained and compared to their non-relativistic counterparts. For most partial waves, the descriptions of phase shifts and inelasticities in the leading-order covariant chiral effective field theory are comparable to those in the next-to-leading order non-relativistic chiral effective field theory, confirming the relatively faster convergence observed in the nucleon-nucleon sector. In addition, we search for bound states/resonances near the $\bar{N}N$ threshold and find several structures that can be associated with those states recently observed by the BESIII Collaboration.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy Nuclear Spin Dependent Parity Violating Amplitudes in $^{133}$Cs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory at the singles and doubles approximation has been implemented to estimate nuclear spin dependent (NSD) parity violating (PV) electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes ($E1_{PV}^{NSD}$) among hyperfine levels of the $6s ~^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in $^{133}$Cs. To validate our calculations, we reproduce the Dirac-Hartree-Fock values and results from the combined coupled-Dirac-Hartree-Fock and random phase approximation (CPDF-RPA) method reported earlier. Contributions from the double-core-polarization (DCP) effects at the CPDF-RPA method were found to be between 3-12\% among different hyperfine levels. We derived a generalized expression for $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$, which helped incorporate both the NSD PV Hamiltonian and E1 operator simultaneously in the perturbative approach to account for the DCP contributions. The RCC method subsumes the CPDF-RPA and DCP effects in addition to contributions from the Br\"uckner pair-correlations and normalization of the wave functions, and correlations among them. To improve accuracy of the $E1_{PV}^{NSD}$ amplitudes further, we replace the {\it ab initio} values of the E1 matrix elements and energies by their experimental values via a sum-over-states approach.</description>

      <title>Inhomogenuous instabilities at large chemical potential in a rainbow-ladder QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we continue our efforts to study the existence of a phase with an inhomogeneous, i.e., spatially varying, chiral condensate in QCD. To this end we employ a previously established method of stability analysis of the two-particle irreducible effective action in a truncation that corresponds to a rainbow-ladder approximation of the quark-gluon interaction of QCD. If the analysis is restricted to homogeneous phases, the phase diagram features a first-order chiral transition in the lower-temperature regime. Performing the stability analysis along the lower-chemical-potential border of the corresponding spinodal region, we find that below a certain temperature the homogeneous chirally symmetric solution is unstable against inhomogeneous condensation. We argue that this instability may persist to chemical potentials above the homogeneous first-order phase boundary, in which case it signals the existence of an inhomogeneous ground state. Our methodology is also applicable for more sophisticated truncations of the QCD effective action.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau (Coulomb, Fokker-Planck) collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator completely. Additionally, by considering the cases of self-collisions and $m_a\ll m_b$, we express all of the Braginskii transport coefficients through the Chapman-Cowling integrals as well. We thus offer a multi-fluid 22-moment model as well as the Braginskii model, which are valid for a large class of (elastic) collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. The particular collisional process - the hard spheres, the Coulomb collisions, the Maxwell molecules, the inverse interparticle force $\sim 1/r^\nu$ (or other cases not discussed here), are specified only at the end, by simply selecting few (pure) numbers. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>Compact dwarfs made of light-quark nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing an equivparticle model with both linear confinement and leading-order perturbative interactions, we obtain systematically the properties of strangelets and nonstrange quark matter ($ud$QM) nuggets at various baryon ($A$) and charge ($Z$) numbers, where the detailed single-quark-energy levels are fixed by solving Dirac equations in mean-field approximation (MFA). We then examine the structures of compact dwarfs made of light strangelets or $ud$QM nuggets forming body-centered cubic lattices in a uniform electron background. Despite the strangelets and $ud$QM nuggets generally become more stable at larger $A$, the compact dwarfs are still stable since the fusion reactions between those objects do not take place in the presence of a Coulomb barrier, which is similar to the cases of light nuclei in normal white dwarfs. If $ud$QM dwarfs or strangelet dwarfs are covered with normal matter, their masses and radii become larger but do not exceed those of ordinary white dwarfs. Finally, we investigate the radial oscillation frequencies of $ud$QM dwarfs and strangelet dwarfs, and find that their frequencies are typically higher than traditional white dwarfs. The stability of compact dwarfs are then analysised by examining radial oscillation frequencies of the fundamental mode, where compact dwarfs covered by normal matter are still stable.</description>

      <title>Role of particle diffusion in shaping the gravitational wave signal from neutron star inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that the dissipative properties of superdense matter play a negligible role in modeling gravitational waveforms from neutron star inspirals. This study aims to investigate whether this presumption holds true for the often neglected dissipative process associated with particle diffusion in superconducting neutron stars. As we demonstrate, diffusion effects can significantly impact the phase of the gravitational wave from the inspiral, manifesting at a magnitude of a few tens of milliradians at large orbit separations, equivalent to orbital frequencies of a few hertz. We also find that dissipation resulting from particle diffusion might increase the neutron star's temperature to approximately $10^7\rm K$ during the inspiral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum turbulence has been addressed both experimentally (predominantly for superfluid $^4$He and $^3$He) and theoretically, the dynamics of various ensembles of quantized vortices was followed in time only until the vortices decay into phonons. How this ``thermalization'' is achieved is still an unelucidated question. Here, we report on the microscopic treatment of the real-time dynamics of an initial ensemble of quantized vortices and anti-vortices, with no phonons, at zero temperature, in a Unitary Fermi Gas (UFG). We follow the system in time until ``thermalization'' is achieved, and a clear non-Markovian evolution of the single particle occupation probabilities is observed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the nature of the $\Delta(1600)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coupled-channel analysis of the $ J^P = 3/2^+ \Delta $-baryon spectrum, based in the framework of Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We construct a Hamiltonian which mixes quark model-like single-particle states and two-particle meson-baryon channels, and constrain this via experimentally measured $ \pi N \to \pi N $ scattering observables. In the same vein as L\"{u}scher's approach, we then connect this infinite-volume inspired Hamiltonian with finite-volume lattice QCD results. Drawing on lattice correlation-matrix eigenvectors identifying the $ 1s $ and $ 2s $ states in the finite-volume $ \Delta(3/2^+) $ spectrum, and utilising the HEFT eigenvectors describing the composition of the energy eigenstates, we resolve the structure of these states and their relation to the $ \Delta(1600) $ resonance. We find the dominant contributions to this resonance come from strong rescattering in the $ \pi N $ and $ \pi \Delta $ channels. This contrasts the long-held view of a dominant quark model-like core for the $ \Delta(1600) $. Further discussion of other contemporary lattice results for the $ \Delta $ spectrum and $ \pi N $ scattering states is also presented.</description>

Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

      <title>Low energy alpha-nucleus optical potential studied via (a,n) cross section measurements on Te isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several processes of stellar nucleosynthesis, like the astrophysical gamma-process, nuclear reactions involving alpha particles play an important role. The description of these reactions necessitates the knowledge of the alpha-nucleus optical model potential (AOMP) which is highly ambiguous at low, astrophysical energies. This ambiguity introduces a substantial uncertainty in the stellar models for predicting elemental and isotopic abundances. The experimental study of the AOMP is thus necessary which can be implemented by measuring the cross section of alpha-induced nuclear reactions. At low energies, (a,n) reactions are suitable for such a purpose. Therefore, in the present work, the (a,n) cross sections of four Te isotopes have been measured, mostly for the first time, and compared with theoretical predictions. The (a,n) cross sections of 120,122,124,130Te have been measured in the energy range between about 10 and 17 MeV using the activation method. The detection of the gamma radiation following the decay of the radioactive reaction products were used to determine the cross sections. The measured cross sections are compared with statistical model calculations obtained from the widely used TALYS nuclear reaction simulation code. Predictions using various available AOMPs are investigated. It is found that the recently developed Atomki-V2 AOMP provides the best description for all studied reactions and this potential also reproduces well the total reaction cross sections from elastic scattering experiments, when they are available in literature. We recommend therefore to use the astrophysical reaction rates based on this potential for nucleosynthesis models of heavy elements.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective field theory, we study the leptoproduction of $J/{\psi}$ at next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD for both unpolarized and polarized electron-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the $J/{\psi}$-tagged deep inelastic scattering in the future Electron-Ion Collider can be served as a golden channel for the reasons including constraining NRQCD long distance matrix elements, probing the nuclear gluon distribution functions, as well as investigating the gluon helicity distribution inside a longitudinal polarized proton.</description>

Abstract: A general organizing principle is proposed that can be used to derive the equations of motion describing the near-equilibrium dynamics of causal and thermodynamically stable relativistic systems. The latter are found to display some new type of universal behavior near equilibrium that allows them to be grouped into universality classes defined by their degrees of freedom, information content, and conservation laws. The universality classes expose a number of surprising equivalences between different theories, shedding new light on the near-equilibrium behavior of relativistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a formalism that was recently developed in a companion paper, we rigorously prove the equivalence, in the linear regime, of a number of apparently different relativistic hydrodynamic theories proposed in the literature. In particular, we show that Hydro+ is indistinguishable from the Israel-Stewart theory for bulk viscosity, which in turn is indistinguishable from a reacting mixture. The two-fluid model for superfluidity coincides with the Israel-Stewart theory for heat conduction in the limit of infinite conductivity, and this explains why the latter has a second sound. Also, MIS$^*$ is equivalent to the Burgers model for viscoelasticity, and this implies that the former must exhibit an elastic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we show that if the degrees of freedom and the conservation laws of a hydrodynamic theory have the same geometric character as those of the Israel-Stewart theory, then such theory must be indistinguishable from the Israel-Stewart theory in the linear regime. This explains why all second-order theories turn out to be identical near equilibrium. Finally, we construct the first linearized model for a relativistic supersolid that is proven to be causal, stable, and strongly hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Impact of the $^6$Li asymptotic normalization constant onto $\alpha$-induced reactions of astrophysical interest</title>

Abstract: Indirect methods have become the predominant approach in experimental nuclear astrophysics for studying several low-energy nuclear reactions occurring in stars, as direct measurements of many of these relevant reactions are rendered infeasible due to their low reaction probability. Such indirect methods, however, require theoretical input that in turn can have significant poorly-quantified uncertainties, which can then be propagated to the reaction rates and have a large effect on our quantitative understanding of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis processes. We present two such examples involving $\alpha$-induced reactions, $^{13}$C($\alpha,n)^{16}$O and $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O, for which the low-energy cross sections have been constrained with $(^6$Li$,d)$ transfer data. In this Letter, we discuss how a first-principle calculation of $^6$Li leads to a 21% reduction of the $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O cross sections with respect to a previous estimation. This calculation further resolves the discrepancy between recent measurements of the $^{13}$C$(\alpha,n)^{16}$O reaction and points to the need for improved theoretical formulations of nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Tensor-force effects on nuclear matter in relativistic ab initio theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory in the full Dirac space, the tensor-force effects on infinite nuclear matter are elucidated by subtracting the matrix elements of tensor forces from the realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. The tensor-force effects for the binding energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the symmetry energy are attractive and are more pronounced around the empirical saturation density, while the tensor forces have little impact on the pure neutron matter. By tuning the tensor-force strength, an infinite (negative) scattering length in the spin-triplet channel is found. This locates the dilute SNM with only the $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ channel interaction at the unitary limit. Its ground-state energy is found proportional to the energy of a free Fermi gas with a scaling factor 0.38, revealing good universal properties. This work paves the way to study the tensor-force effects in neutron stars as well as finite nuclei from realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions, highlights the role of the tensor force on the deviation of the nuclear physics to the unitary limit, and provides valuable reference for studies of the four-component unitary Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-scalar meson spectral properties in the chiral crossover region of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the type of excitations that can exist in a thermal medium is key to understanding how hadronic matter behaves at extreme temperatures. In this work we study this question for pseudo-scalar mesons comprised of light-strange and strange-strange quarks, analysing how their low-energy spectral properties are modified as one passes through the high-temperature chiral crossover region between $T=145.6 \, \text{MeV}$ and $172.3 \, \text{MeV}$. We utilise the non-perturbative constraints satisfied by correlation functions at finite temperature in order to extract the low-energy meson spectral function contributions from spatial correlator lattice data in $N_{f}=2+1$ flavour QCD. The robustness of these contributions are tested by comparing their predictions with data for the corresponding temporal correlator at different momentum values. We find that around the pseudo-critical temperature $T_{\text{pc}}$ the data in both the light-strange and strange-strange channels is consistent with the presence of a distinct stable particle-like ground state component, a so-called thermoparticle excitation. As the temperature increases this excitation undergoes collisional broadening, and this is qualitatively the same in both channels. These findings suggest that pseudo-scalar mesons in QCD have a bound-state-like structure at low energies within the chiral crossover region which is still strongly influenced by the vacuum states of the theory.</description>

      <title>Quark production and thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first assemble a full set of the Boltzmann Equation in Diffusion Approximation (BEDA) for studying thermalization/hydrodynamization as well as the production of massless quarks and antiquarks in out of equilibrium systems. In the BEDA, the time evolution of a generic system is characterized by the following space-time dependent quantities: the jet quenching parameter, the effective temperature, and two more for each quark flavor that describe the conversion between gluons and quarks/antiquarks via the $2\leftrightarrow2$ processes. Out of the latter two quantities, an effective net quark chemical potential is defined, which equals the net quark chemical potential after thermal equilibration. We then study thermalization and the production of three flavors of massless quarks and antiquarks in spatially homogeneous systems initially filled only with gluons. A parametric understanding of thermalization and quark production is obtained for either initially very dense or dilute systems, which are complemented by detailed numerical simulations for intermediate values of initial gluon occupancy $f_0$. For a wide range of $f_0$, the final equilibration time is determined to be about one order of magnitude longer than that in the corresponding pure gluon systems. Moreover, during the final stage of the thermalization process for $f_0\geq 10^{-4}$, gluons are found to thermalize earlier than quarks and antiquarks, undergoing the top-down thermalization.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensate and the equation of state at nonzero baryon density from the hadron resonance gas model with a repulsive mean field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD equation of state and the chiral condensate using the hadron resonance gas model with repulsive mean-field interactions. We find that the repulsive interactions improve the agreement with the lattice results on the derivatives of the pressure with respect to the baryon chemical potential up to eighth order. From the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate we estimate the crossover temperature as a function of baryon chemical potential, $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$. We find that the chiral crossover line starts to deviate significantly from the chemical freeze-out line already for $\mu_B&gt;400$ MeV. Furthermore, we find that the chiral pseudocritical line can be parametrized as $T_{pc}(\mu_B)/T_{pc}(0)=1-\kappa_2 (\mu_B/T_{pc} (0))^2-\kappa_4 (\mu_B/T_{pc} (0))^4$ with $\kappa_2=0.0150(2)$ and $\kappa_4=3.1(6) \times 10^{-5}$, which are in agreement with lattice QCD results for small values of $\mu_B$. For the first time we find a tiny but non-zero value of $\kappa_4$ in our study.</description>

      <title>Incorporating $DD\pi$ effects and left-hand cuts in lattice QCD studies of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the relativistic field-theoretic three-particle finite-volume scattering formalism to describe generic $DD\pi$ systems in the charm $C=2$ sector. This includes the isospin-0 channel, in which the recently discovered doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is expected to manifest as a pole in the $DD \pi \to DD \pi$ scattering amplitude. The formalism presented here can also be applied to lattice QCD settings in which the $D^*$ is bound and, in particular, remains valid below the left-hand cut in $D D^*$ scattering, thus resolving an issue in previous analyses of lattice-determined finite-volume energies.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mesonic decay branch of the $\bar{K}\!N\!N$ quasi-bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted measurements of $K^- + {^3{\rm He}} \to \pi \!Y \!N + N'$ reactions using a $1~{\rm GeV}/c$ $K^-$-beam, with the objective of understanding the broad decay width of $\bar{K} \!N \!N$ (approximately twice as broad as that of $\Lambda(1405)$ considered to be the $\bar{K} \!N$ quasi-bound state). We successfully reproduced distributions of the $\pi \! Y \! N$ invariant mass and momentum transfer for $\pi \! Y \! N$ using model fitting functions for $\bar{K} \!N \!N$ formation and quasi-free $\bar{K}$ absorption (${\rm QF}_{\bar{K}-{\rm abs}}$) processes. The model can describe the experimental data quite well, and four $\bar{K} \! N \! N \to \pi \! Y \! N $ cross-sections were obtained. The results indicate that mesonic decay is the dominant decay branch of $\bar{K} \! N \! N$. The results also suggest that $\Gamma_{\pi \Lambda N} \sim \Gamma_{\pi \Sigma N}$, which indicates that the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=1$ absorption channel, in addition to the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=0$ absorption channel, substantially contribute to the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ decay, making the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ state approximately twice as unstable as $\Lambda$(1405).</description>
