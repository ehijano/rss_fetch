      <title>On flexibility of affine factorial varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a criterion of factoriality of a suspension. This allows to construct many examples of flexible affine factorial varieties. In particular, we find a homogeneous affine factorial 3-fold that is not a homogeneous space of an algebraic group.</description>

      <title>Normality of Schubert varieties in affine Grassmannians II: The tamely ramified case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a criterion for the normality of Schubert varieties in affine Grassmannians for many reductive groups (including all adjoint groups in characteristic at least 5 as well as all tamely ramified groups) in terms of the order of the algebraic fundamental group of a certain Levi subgroup, in particular in small positive characteristic. As an application, we obtain a similar normality criterion for local models in both equal and mixed characteristic. In particular, we give a classification of normal Pappas-Zhu local models at absolutely special level as well as for groups of semisimple rank 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of noncommutative surfaces called Artin--Schelter surfaces of del Pezzo types, which contains del Pezzo surfaces as special cases. We show that the moduli stacks of marked Artin--Schelter surfaces of del Pezzo types are birational to the moduli stacks of tuples consisting of a smooth projective curve of genus 1, two line bundles of degree 3, and a collection of line bundles of degree 1 on the curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the volumes of divisors in Calabi--Yau type varieties. We show that given a klt Calabi--Yau pair $(X,B)$ and an integral divisor $A$ on $X$, the volume of $A$ is in a fixed discrete set depending only on the dimension and singularities of $(X,B)$. As an application, we prove a boundedness result of polarized log Calabi--Yau pairs which was conjectured by Birkar.</description>

      <title>Birational Invariants from Hodge Structures and Quantum Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new invariants of smooth complex projective varieties, called Hodge atoms. Their construction combines rational Gromov-Witten invariants with classical Hodge theory and relies on the notion of an F-bundle, which is a non-archimedean version of a non-commutative Hodge structure. The Hodge atoms arise from the spectral decomposition of the F-bundle under the Euler vector field action, and behave additively under blowups, in accordance with Iritani's blowup theorem. We compute several examples and demonstrate applications to birational geometry. In particular, we prove that a very general cubic fourfold is not rational. We also obtain a new proof of the equality of Hodge numbers of birational Calabi-Yau manifolds in any dimension. Furthermore, we show that the framework naturally extends to representations of other motivic Galois groups. This enables the theory of atoms to produce new obstructions to rationality over non-algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero as well.</description>

      <title>Derived autoequivalences of length 2 flops via GIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the derived autoequivalences of a flopping rational curve of length 2 using GIT and the theory of windows applied to the universal length 2 flop. We show that the stringy K\"ahler moduli space (SKMS) associated to the GIT problem, as constructed by Halpern-Leistner-Sam, matches the description of the space obtained for length 2 threefolds by Hirano-Wemyss as a quotient of a Bridgeland stability manifold. Furthermore, we show that its fundamental group acts via contraction algebra and fibre algebra twists, hence recovering the monodromy action described by Donovan-Wemyss. In particular, this shows that the two approaches to building the SKMS agree in this setting.</description>

      <title>Lie algebroids, quantum Poisson algebroids, and Lie algebroid connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Lie algebroids over commutative ringed spaces. Lie algebroids over ringed spaces unify the existing notion of Lie algebroids over smooth manifolds, complex manifolds, analytic spaces, algebraic varieties, and schemes. We show that the universal enveloping algebroid of a Lie algebroid possesses a natural filtration that yields a structure of a sheaf of quantum Poisson algebras. We establish a bijective correspondence between sheaves of quantum Poisson algebras and Lie algebroids. We show that this correspondence leads to an adjunction between the two categories. We discuss this bijective correspondence in particular cases of Lie algebroids over ringed spaces and highlight the subsequent results. To characterize non-flat Lie algebroid connections, we construct a sheaf of twisted universal enveloping algebras for a Lie algebroid using Lie algebroid (hyper) cohomology. We show that our construction yields some of the existing constructions for Lie-Rinehart algebras and holomorphic Lie algebroids. As another application, we study the deformation groupoid of a Lie algebroid using the second hypercohomology of the Lie algebroid.</description>

Abstract: As a direct application of Dilworth truncations of polymatroids, we give short proofs of two theorems: Bernstein's characterisation of algebraic matroids coming from the Hadamard product of two linear spaces, and a formula for the dimension of the amoeba of a complex linear space by Draisma, Eggleston, Pendavingh, Rau, and Yuen. We disprove Bernstein's conjecture on a characterisation of the algebraic matroids of Hadamard products of more than two linear spaces, by giving explicit counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Single-valued periods of meromorphic modular forms and a motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate.
  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The F-pure threshold versus the a-invariant for standard graded rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hirose, Watanabe and Yoshida conjectured a criterion for a standard graded strongly $F$-regular ring to be Gorenstein in terms of the $F$-pure threshold. We complete the proof of this conjecture. We also prove natural extensions of the conjecture to section rings of normal, $F$-split projective varieties with respect to globally generated ample divisors. Our proof exploits the geometry of the Proj of the graded ring.</description>

      <title>Rational Witt vectors and associated sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sheafification of $W_{\mathrm{rat}} (\mathcal{O})$ and of the maps $\underline{\mathbb{Z}} \mathcal{O} \to W_{\mathrm{rat}} (\mathcal{O})$ and $W_{\mathrm{rat}} (\mathcal{O}) \to W_J (\mathcal{O})$ in various Grothendieck topologies, both subcanonical and non-subcanonical. Here, for a commutative ring $A$, $\underline{\mathbb{Z}} A$ is the reduced monoid algebra on $(A , \cdot)$ and $W_{\mathrm{rat}} (A)$ is the subring of rational functions in the big Witt ring $W (A)$. Moreover, $W_J$ is the ind-scheme representing $W_{\mathrm{rat}}$ on Fatou rings which was introduced by Hazewinkel and which we prove to be an ind-ring scheme. It turns out, for example that for any field $K$, we have $W_{\mathrm{rat}} (K) = \Gamma (\mathrm{spec}\, K , (\underline{\mathbb{Z}}\mathcal{O})^{\sharp})$ where $\sharp$ denotes the associated sheaf in the finite flat topology. More generally, this is true for Dedekind rings. By comparing our results with work of Suslin and Voevodsky we found an isomorphism of $W_{\mathrm{rat}} (A)$ for normal domains $A$ with a ring of universally integral finite relative correspondences. This gives a new geometric interpretation of Almkvist's theorem on cyclic $K$-theory for such rings and suggests a number of interesting questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$, in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the class of permawound unipotent groups, and show that they simultaneously satisfy certain "ubiquity" and "rigidity" properties that in combination render them very useful in the study of general wound unipotent groups. As an illustration of their utility, we present two applications: We prove that nonsplit smooth unipotent groups over (infinite) finitely-generated fields have infinite first cohomology; and we show that every commutative p-torsion wound unipotent group over a field of degree of imperfection 1 is the maximal unipotent quotient of a commutative pseudo-reductive group, thus partially answering a question of Totaro.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a pair (X,L) consisting of a projective variety X over a perfect field of characteristic p&gt;0 and an ample line bundle L on X, we introduce and study a positive characteristic analog of the $\alpha$-invariant introduced by Tian, which we call the $\alpha_F$-invariant. We utilize the theory of F-singularities in positive characteristics, and our approach is based on replacing klt singularities with the closely related notion of global F-regularity. We show that the $\alpha_F$-invariant of a pair (X,L) can be understood in terms of the global Frobenius splittings of the linear systems |mL|, for m&gt;0. We establish inequalities relating the $\alpha_F$-invariant with the F- signature, and use that to prove the positivity of the $\alpha_F$-invariant for all globally F-regular projective varieties (with respect to any ample L on X). When X is a Fano variety and L is $-K_X$, we prove that the $\alpha_F$-invariant of X is always bounded above by 1/2 and establish tighter comparisons with the F-signature. We also show that for toric Fano varieties, the $\alpha_F$-invariant matches with the usual (complex) $\alpha$-invariant.</description>

We connect this topic to the study of mixed discriminants and multiple solutions of systems of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Around the topological classification problem of polynomial maps: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the topology of polynomial maps originates from classical questions in affine geometry, such as the Jacobian Conjecture, as well as from works of Whitney, Thom, and Mather in the 1950-70s on diffeomorphism types of smooth maps. During that period, Thom came up with a famous construction of a one-dimensional family of real polynomial maps all sharing the same degree, but in which every polynomial map has its unique topological type. According to his convention, the topological type of a map is preserved precisely when it is composed with homeomorphisms on both source and target spaces.
  Thom also conjectured that for each pair $(n,d)$, any family of $n$--variate, degree--$d$ (complex, or real) polynomial functions has at most finitely-many topological types. Soon after, a collection of results by several mathematicians throughout the 1970s and 1980s settled this conjecture, and solved its subsequent generalization to polynomial maps.
  In this survey, we outline the historical context and highlight a range of significant works from the 1950s to the present day that lead to the current state of the art in the study of polynomial maps' topology. The focal point of this survey is to shed some light on the ensuing classification problem of topological types of polynomial maps. The presentation is achieved by making a gentle introduction to several other prominent questions in affine geometry, all of which are recounted through the lens of this classification problem.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation functors, Koszul duality, and Maurer-Cartan spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarise the chain of comparisons showing Hinich's derived Maurer-Cartan functor gives an equivalence between differential graded Lie algebras and derived Schlessinger functors on Artinian differential graded-commutative algebras. We include some motivating deformation problems and analogues for more general Koszul dual pairs of operads.</description>

      <title>The volume function is upper semicontinuous on families of divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of volumes of divisors in a family. We show that the volume of a divisor on the generic fiber equals the infimum of its volumes on fibers over any dense subset of the base. As an application, we show that the volume function of a divisor is upper semicontinuous in flat families with reduced and irreducible fibers.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of cones of projective hypersurfaces with singularities isolated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Z$ be a projective hypersurface such that its underlying reduced variety has only isolated singularities. In case its irreducible components have constant multiplicities, for instance if $\dim Z&gt;1$, we show that the spectrum of its cone can be described by using the spectral numbers at singular points of the reduced hypersurface and the global degree. In the non-reduced plane curve case, assuming that the underlying reduced curve has only semi-weighted-homogeneous singularities, we express the spectrum of the cone in terms of the local weights and the weighted degrees and multiplicities of local irreducible components together with the degrees and multiplicities of global ones. These generalize a formula for reduced line arrangements. In the non-reduced ordinary (that is, semi-homogeneous) singularity case, the second formula is essentially equivalent to the one obtained by the third-named author.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Galois property of hypersurfaces over algebraic integers across other characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate hypersurfaces defined over a ring of algebraic integers, and show that if the projection from a point induces a Galois extension over either a number field or the residue field associated with a prime ideal satisfying certain conditions, then the Galois property persists under reduction modulo the residue field associated with all but finitely many such prime ideals. Furthermore, for quartic hypersurfaces, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the Galois group to be given by a projective linear group, depending on the characteristic of the base field.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics and Hodge theory of degenerations of abelian varieties: A survey of the Mumford construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey the Mumford construction of degenerating abelian varieties, with a focus on the analytic version of the construction, and its relation to toric geometry. Moreover, we study the geometry and Hodge theory of multivariable degenerations of abelian varieties associated to regular matroids, and extend some fundamental results of Clemens on 1-parameter semistable degenerations to the multivariable setting.</description>

      <title>On the generators of coordinate algebras of affine ind-varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the structure of the coordinate ring of an affine ind-variety. We prove that any coordinate ring of an affine ind-variety which is not isomorphic to an affine algebraic variety does not have a countable set of generators. Also we prove that coordinate rings of affine ind-varieties have an everywhere dense subspace of countable dimension.</description>

      <title>Nonrational varieties with unirational parametrizations of coprime degrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists a $2$-dimensional family of smooth cubic threefolds admitting unirational parametrizations of coprime degrees. This together with Clemens--Griffiths' work solves the long standing open problem whether there exists a nonrational variety with unirational parametrizations of coprime degrees. Our proof uses a new approach, called the Noether--Cremona method, for determining the rationality of quotients of hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>A minimal resolution for the Jacobian ideal of a generic curve arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nodal curve $C$ in the complex projective plane whose irreducible components $C_i$ are smooth. A minimal set of generators $G$ for the first and second syzygy modules of the Jacobian ideal of $C$ are described, using recent results by Th. Kahle, H. Schenck, B. Sturmfels and M. Wiesmann on the likelihood correspondence. The elements of $G$ have explicit formulas in terms of the equations $f_i=0$ of the irreducible components $C_i$ of $C$. Similar results, including extensions to hypersurfaces arrangements in $\mathbb{P}^n$ were obtained by R. Burity, Z. Ramos, A. Simis and St. Toh\u aneanu with a genericity assumption which may not be easy to test in practice.</description>

      <title>On holographic duals of certain isolated weighted Gorenstein cDV singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on an important mathematical conjecture, together with hypothesis of homological mirror symmetry in the context of Landau-Ginzburg models, we show that a class of compound Du Val singularities do not admit a crepant resolution. Most of these singularities sit in the type cEn. This implies that those singularities are not dual to four dimensional N =1 superconformal quiver gauge theories through stacks of D3 branes placed at the singularities. We verify this statement on the physics side by enumerating consistent gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic higher-genus integration kernels via convolution over homology cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polylogarithms on arbitrary higher-genus Riemann surfaces can be constructed from meromorphic integration kernels with at most simple poles, whose definition was given by Enriquez via functional properties. In this work, homotopy-invariant convolution integrals over homology cycles are shown to provide a direct construction of Enriquez kernels solely from holomorphic Abelian differentials and the prime form. Our new representation is used to demonstrate the closure of the space of Enriquez kernels under convolution over homology cycles and under variations of the moduli. The results of this work further strengthen the remarkable parallels of Enriquez kernels with the non-holomorphic modular tensors recently developed in an alternative construction of higher-genus polylogarithms.</description>
