      <title>Limit cycles of piecewise smooth differential systems of the type nonlinear center and saddle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise linear differential systems separated by two parallel straight lines of the type of center-center-Hamiltonian saddle and the center-Hamiltonian saddle-Hamiltonian saddle can have at most one limit cycle and there are systems in these classes having one limit cycle. In this paper, we study the limit cycles of a piecewise smooth differential system separated by two parallel straight lines formed by nonlinear centers and a Hamiltonian saddle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite countable amenable group and $P$ a polyhedron with topological dimension $dim(P)&lt;\infty$. We construct a minimal subshift $(X,G)$ such that its mean topological dimension is equal to $dim(P)$. This result answers the question of D. Dou in \cite{DD}, moreover, it is also an extension of the work of L. Jin and Y. Qiao \cite{JQ} for $\mathbb{Z}$-action.</description>

      <title>Scalable Optimal Motion Planning for Multi-Agent Systems by Cosserat Theory of Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the motion planning problem for large multi-agent systems, utilizing Cosserat rod theory to model the dynamic behavior of vehicle formations. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem over partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the system as a continuum. This approach ensures scalability with respect to the number of vehicles, as the problem's complexity remains unaffected by the size of the formation. The numerical discretization of the governing equations and problem's constraints is achieved through Bernstein surface polynomials, facilitating the conversion of the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. This NLP problem is subsequently solved using off-the-shelf optimization software. We present several properties and algorithms related to Bernstein surface polynomials to support the selection of this methodology. Numerical demonstrations underscore the efficacy of this mathematical framework.</description>

      <title>Strong and Weak Random Walks on Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walks play an important role in probing the structure of complex networks. On traditional networks, they can be used to extract community structure, understand node centrality, perform link prediction, or capture the similarity between nodes. On signed networks, where the edge weights can be either positive or negative, it is non-trivial to design a random walk which can be used to extract information about the signed structure of the network, in particular the ability to partition the graph into communities with positive edges inside and negative edges in between. Prior works on signed network random walks focus on the case where there are only two such communities (strong balance), which is rarely the case in empirical networks. In this paper, we propose a signed network random walk which can capture the structure of a network with more than two such communities (weak balance). The walk results in a similarity matrix which can be used to cluster the nodes into antagonistic communities. We compare the characteristics of the so-called strong and weak random walks, in terms of walk length and stationarity. We show through a series of experiments on synthetic and empirical networks that the similarity matrix based on weak walks can be used for both unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering, outperforming the same similarity matrix based on strong walks when the graph has more than two communities, or exhibits asymmetry in the density of links. These results suggest that other random-walk based algorithms for signed networks could be improved simply by running them with weak walks instead of strong walks.</description>

      <title>Iterative method for real-time Hybrid testing: application to a cantilever beam with two interface degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an iterative method for real-time hybrid testing (RTHT) is proposed. The method seeks to iteratively balance the interface conditions between the physical and numerical substructures by controlling the periodic demand of the actuators. It is then suitable for RTHT of structures undergoing a periodic response, e.g. structures excited at resonance. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method on a cantilever beam in bending motion with two degrees of freedom at the interface, which we use as a prototype for future testing of aircraft wings. We show that a number of challenges arise in these settings, such as the difficulty in measuring interface forces while controlling a continuous structure and the instability of the hybrid test for small time delays. Classical RTHT strategies could produce inaccurate or unstable outcomes, whereas the proposed method is able to attain very good interface synchronisation in a wide range of tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Shape differentiation for Poincar\'e maps of harmonic fields in toroidal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study Poincar\'e maps of harmonic fields in toroidal domains using a shape variational approach. Given a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^3$, we define its harmonic fields as the set of magnetic fields which are curl free and tangent to the boundary. For toroidal domains, this space is one dimensional, and one may thus single out a harmonic field by specifying a degree of freedom, such as the circulation along a toroidal loop. We are then interested in the Poincar\'e maps of such fields restricted to the boundary, which produce diffeomorphisms of the circle. We begin by proving a general shape differentiability result of such Poincar\'e maps in the smooth category, and obtain a general formula for the shape derivative. We then investigate two specific examples of interest; axisymmetric domains, and domains for which the harmonic field has a diophantine rotation number on the boundary. We prove that, in the first case, the shape derivative of the Poincar\'e map is always identically zero, whereas in the second case, assuming an additional condition on the geometry of the domain, the shape derivative of the Poincar\'e map may be any smooth function of the circle by choosing an appropriate perturbation of the domain.</description>

      <title>Pathways to hyperchaos in a three-dimensional quadratic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with various routes to hyperchaos with all three positive Lyapunov exponents in a three-dimensional quadratic map. The map under consideration displays strong hyperchaoticity in the sense that in a wider range of parameter space the system showcase three positive Lyapunov exponents. It is shown that the saddle periodic orbits eventually become repellers at this hyperchaotic regime. By computing the distance of the repellers to the attractors as a function of parameters, it is shown that the hyperchaotic attractors absorb the repelling periodic orbits. First we discuss a route from stable fixed point undergoing period-doubling bifurcations to chaos and then hyperchaos, and role of saddle periodic orbits. We then illustrate a route from doubling bifurcation of quasiperiodic closed invariant curves to hyperchaotic attractors. Finally, presence of weak hyperchaotic flow like attractors are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Slope Problem in Discrete Iteration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slope problem in holomorphic dynamics in the unit disk goes back to Wolff in 1929. However, there have been several contributions to this problem in the last decade. In this article the problem is revisited, comparing the discrete and continuous cases. Some advances are derived in the discrete parabolic case of zero hyperbolic step, showing that the set of slopes has to be a closed interval which is independent of the initial point. The continuous setting is used to show that any such interval is a possible example. In addition, the set of slopes of a family of parabolic function is discussed, leading to examples of functions with some regularity whose set of slopes is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>On extended model of Josephson junction, linear systems with polynomial solutions, determinantal surfaces and Painlev\'e 3 equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a 3-parameter family of linear special double confluent Heun equations introduced and studied by V.M.Buchstaber and S.I.Tertychnyi, which is an equivalent presentation of a model of Josephson junction in superconductivity. Buchstaber and Tertychnyi have shown that the set of those complex parameters for which the Heun equation has a polynomial solution is a union of explicit planar algebraic curves: the spectral curves indexed by $\ell\in\mathbb N$. In his paper with I.V.Netay, the author has shown that each spectral curve is irreducible in Heun equation parameters (consists of two irreducible components in parameters of Josephson junction model). Netay discovered numerically and conjectured a genus formula for spectral curves. He reduced it to the conjecture stating that each of them is regular in $\mathbb C^2$ with a coordinate axis deleted. Here we prove Netay's regularity and genus conjectures. For the proof we study a 4-parameter extension of a family of linear systems equivalent to the Heun equations. They yield an equivalent presentation of the extension of model of Josephson junction introduced by the author in his paper with Yu.P.Bibilo. We describe the so-called determinantal surfaces consisting of linear systems with polynomial solutions as explicit algebraic surfaces indexed by $\ell\in\mathbb N$. The spectral curves are their intersections with the hyperplane of the initial Heun equation family. We prove that each determinantal surface is regular outside appropriate hyperplane and consists of two rational irreducible components. The proofs use Stokes phenomena theory, holomorphic vector bundle technique, foliation of determinantal surfaces by isomonodromic families of linear systems governed by Painlev\'e 3 equation and transversality of the latter foliation to the initial model.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Likelihood Approach to Filtering for Advection-Diffusion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Bayesian data assimilation scheme is formulated for advection-dominated advective and diffusive evolutionary problems, based upon the Dynamic Likelihood (DLF) approach to filtering. The DLF was developed specifically for hyperbolic problems -waves-, and in this paper, it is extended via a split step formulation, to handle advection-diffusion problems. In the dynamic likelihood approach, observations and their statistics are used to propagate probabilities along characteristics, evolving the likelihood in time. The estimate posterior thus inherits phase information. For advection-diffusion the advective part of the time evolution is handled on the basis of observations alone, while the diffusive part is informed through the model as well as observations. We expect, and indeed show here, that in advection-dominated problems, the DLF approach produces better estimates than other assimilation approaches, particularly when the observations are sparse and have low uncertainty. The added computational expense of the method is cubic in the total number of observations over time, which is on the same order of magnitude as a standard Kalman filter and can be mitigated by bounding the number of forward propagated observations, discarding the least informative data.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic Kac-Moody Calogero model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new kind of quantum Calogero model is proposed, based on a hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra. We formulate nonrelativistic quantum mechanics on the Minkowskian root space of the simplest rank-3 hyperbolic Lie algebra $AE_3$ with an inverse-square potential given by its real roots and reduce it to the unit future hyperboloid. By stereographic projection this defines a quantum mechanics on the Poincar\'e disk with a unique potential. Since the Weyl group of $AE_3$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of the modular group PSL(2,$\mathbb{Z}_2$), the model is naturally formulated on the complex upper half plane, and its potential is a real modular function. We present and illustrate the relevant features of $AE_3$, give some approximations to the potential and rewrite it as an (almost everywhere convergent) Poincar\'e series. The standard Dunkl operators are constructed and investigated on Minkowski space and on the hyperboloid. In the former case find that their commutativity is obstructed by rank-2 subgroups of hyperbolic type (the simplest one given by the Fibonacci sequence), casting doubt on the integrability of the model. An appendix with Don Zagier investigates the computability of the potential. We foresee applications to cosmological billards and to quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Sharp systolic inequalities for invariant tight contact forms on principal S1-bundles over S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systole of a contact form $\alpha$ is defined as the shortest period of closed Reeb orbits of $\alpha$. Given a non-trivial $\mathbb S^1$-principal bundle over $\mathbb S^2$ with total space $M$, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for the class of tight contact form on $M$ invariant under the $\mathbb S^1$-action. This inequality exhibits a behavior which depends on the Euler class of the bundle in a subtle way. As applications, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for rotationally symmetric Finsler metrics on $\mathbb S^2$, a systolic inequality for the shortest contractible closed Reeb orbit, and a particular case of a conjecture by Viterbo.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model order reduction of large-scale dynamical systems with root mean squared error measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>
