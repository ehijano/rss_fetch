      <title>Highly divisible cycles in homological Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_*$ be a homology theory of finite type and $\{E^r_{s,t}(X)=\frac{Z^r_{s,t}(X)}{B^r_{s,t}(X)}; d^r_{s,t}\}$ denote the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for $F_*$ of a $CW$-complex $X$. In this paper we study elements of the maximal possible order in the groups $E^2_{n,0}(X)/Z^{r}_{n,0}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Computational Approaches to the Singer Transfer: Preimages in the Lambda Algebra and $G_k$-Invariant Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic, algorithmic method to compute the preimage of elements under the Singer algebraic transfer. Using the lambda algebra and the invariant-theoretic formula of P.H. Chon and L.M. Ha [5], we formulate the preimage search as a solvable problem in linear algebra. This framework is applied to study key indecomposable elements in the Adams spectral sequence. As a consequence, we show that the proof of the known result that $d_0$ lies in the image of the fourth Singer transfer, as given by Nguyen Sum in [17], is false. Furthermore, we provide the explicit description of a preimage for the element $p_0 \in Ext^{4,4+33}_{\mathcal A}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2).$ This preimage had not been explicitly determined in the previous work of N.H.V. Hung and V.T.N. Quynh [8]. Finally, our most significant contribution is the construction of a complete \textsc{SageMath} algorithm that fully automates the computation of both the dimension and an explicit basis for the $G_k$-invariant space $[(Q\mathcal{P}_k)_d]^{G_k}$. This tool facilitates the verification of our results [11, 12, 13] that were previously computed manually in connection with Singer's conjecture for rank 4.</description>

      <title>Towards the $p=3$ Kervaire Invariant Problem: The $E_2$-page for the homotopy fixed points spectral sequence computing $\pi_*({E_6}^{hC_9})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel suggest that the last remaining Kervaire invariant problem, the case of $p=3$, can be solved by computing the homotopy fixed points spectral sequence for $\pi_* E_6^{hC_9}$. We prove a detection theorem for this case and use a conjectural form of the $C_9$-action on $E_6$ to compute the $E_2$ page of this spectral sequence away from homological degree zero.</description>

      <title>Condensation of the operad for multiplicative hyperoperads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a map of operads from an $E_2$-operad to the condensation of the operad for multiplicative hyperoperads. We deduce from it the existence of an $E_2$-action on the homotopy limit of the underlying functor of a multiplicative hyperoperad. This result is the higher dimensional analogue of a result due to Batanin and Berger implying Deligne's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series for Configuration Spaces of Punctured Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g,r}$ denote the $r$-punctured closed Riemann surface of genus $g$. For every $g\geq 0$, we determine the four-variable generating function for the mixed Hodge numbers of the unordered configuration spaces of $\Sigma_{g,1}$. The cases where $g\geq 2$ are new. Combining a result of \cite{huang2020cohomology}, this determines the analogous generating function for $\Sigma_{g,r}$ for all $r\geq 1$. As an application of our formula we illustrate how classical homological stability results, as well as so-called secondary stability results of \cite{miller2019higher} can be interpolated to illustrate stable behaviors in the mixed Hodge numbers of these spaces which have been thus-far undiscovered.</description>

      <title>The algebra of semi-flows: a tale of two topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To capture the global structure of a dynamical system we reformulate dynamics in terms of appropriately constructed topologies, which we call flow topologies; we call this process topologization. This yields a description of a semi-flow in terms of a bi-topological space, with the first topology corresponding to the (phase) space and the second to the flow topology. A study of topology is facilitated through discretization, i.e. defining and examining appropriate finite sub-structures. Topologizing the dynamics provides an elegant solution to their discretization by discretizing the associated flow topologies. We introduce Morse pre-orders, an instance of a more general bi-topological discretization, which synthesize the space and flow topologies, and encode the directionality of dynamics. We describe how Morse pre-orders can be augmented with appropriate (co)homological information in order to describe invariance of the dynamics; this ensemble provides an algebraization of the semi-flow. An illustration of the main ingredients of the paper is provided by an application to the theory of discrete parabolic flows. Algebraization yields a new invariant for positive braids in terms of a bi-graded differential module which contains Morse theoretic information of parabolic flows.</description>

      <title>Culf maps and edgewise subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for any simplicial space $X$, the $\infty$-category of culf maps over $X$ is equivalent to the $\infty$-category of right fibrations over $\operatorname{sd}(X)$, the edgewise subdivision of $X$. (When $X$ is a Rezk complete Segal or 2-Segal space, $\operatorname{sd}(X)$ is the twisted arrow category of $X$.) We give two proofs of independent interest; one exploiting comprehensive factorization and the natural transformation from the edgewise subdivision to the nerve of the category of elements, and another exploiting a new factorization system of ambifinal and culf maps, together with the right adjoint to edgewise subdivision. Using this main theorem, we show that the $\infty$-category of decomposition spaces and culf maps is locally an $\infty$-topos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For associative rings with anti-involution several homology theories exists, for instance reflexive homology as studied by Graves and involutive Hochschild homology defined by Fern\`andez-Val\`encia and Giansiracusa. We prove that the corresponding homology groups can be identified with the homotopy groups of an equivariant Loday construction of the one-point compactification of the sign-representation evaluated at the trivial orbit, if we assume that $2$ is invertible and if the underlying abelian group of the ring is flat. We also show a relative version where we consider an associative $k$-algebra with an anti-involution where $k$ is an arbitrary ground ring.</description>

      <title>Trinitary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A {\em trinitary algebra} is any subalgebra of the space of smooth functions $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ that is distinguished in this space by finitely many linear conditions of the form $f(x_i) = f(\tilde x_i) = f(\hat x_i)$, where $x_i, \tilde x_i,$ and $ \hat x_i $ are distinct points in $ M$, $i=1, \dots, k$, or is approximated by such subalgebras. Trinitary algebras naturally arise in the study of discriminant varieties, i.e., the spaces of singular geometric objects, in theories where the property of being singular is formulated in terms of simultaneous behavior at three distinct points. The space of all trinitary algebras in $C^\infty(M, {\mathbb R})$ is analogous to the space of all ideals of finite codimension, which plays the same role in the study of discriminants defined in the terms of a single singular point, and also to the space of {\em equilevel algebras} (see \cite{EA}) which are defined by collections of conditions $f(x_i)=f(\tilde x_i)$ and play the same role in the study of discriminants defined by binary singularities like the self-intersections of the image. We classify the trinitary algebras up to the codimension four in $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$, describe the cell structures of the varieties of these algebras, and calculate their homology groups and Stiefel--Whitney classes of their canonical normal bundles.</description>

      <title>Models for cyclic infinity operads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct model structures on cyclic dendroidal sets and cyclic dendroidal spaces for cyclic quasi-operads and complete cyclic dendroidal Segal spaces, respectively. We show these models are Quillen equivalent to the model structure for simplicial cyclic operads. This answers in the affirmative a question of the second author and Drummond-Cole concerning model structures for cyclic $\infty$-operads. We infer similar statements for planar cyclic $\infty$-operads, providing the model-categorical foundation needed to complete Walde's program on the relationship between cyclic 2-Segal spaces and planar cyclic $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <title>A matrix criterion and algorithmic approach for the Peterson hit problem: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [15] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [15].</description>

      <title>The Basic Reproduction Number for Petri Net Models: A Next-Generation Matrix Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basic reproduction number (R_0) is an epidemiological metric that represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The methodology for calculating this metric is well-defined for numerous model types, including, most prominently, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The basic reproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an outbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to inform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the spread of diseases. A Petri net (PN) is a directed bipartite graph where places, transitions, arcs, and the firing of the arcs determine the dynamic behavior of the system. Petri net models have been an increasingly used tool within the epidemiology community. However, a generalized method for calculating R_0 directly from PN models has not been established. Thus, in this paper, we present a general method for calculating R_0 for Petri nets. Additionally, we show how a computational method implementing the next-generation algorithm in ODE models can also be applied to Petri net models. We also provide multiple examples of how to use this approach to calculate 0 for various SIR-type Petri net models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. The soft random simplicial complexes is a model for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$. This new model depends on a probability vector $\rho$ which allows the simplicial complexes to present randomness in all dimensions. In this article, we use a normal approximation theorem to prove central limit theorems for the number of $k$-faces and for the Euler's characteristic for soft random simplicial complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the twisted cohomology of the mapping class group with level structures, with coefficients in the $r$-tensor powers of the Prym representations for any positive integer $r$. When $r\ge 2$, we show that the cohomology exhibits instability for large genus, whereas it remains stable for $r=0$ or $r=1$. As a corollary, we prove that the symplectic Prym representation associated with any finite abelian regular cover of a non-closed finite-type surface is infinitesimally rigid.</description>
