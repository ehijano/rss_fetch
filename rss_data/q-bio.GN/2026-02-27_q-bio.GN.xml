      <title>CrossLLM-Mamba: Multimodal State Space Fusion of LLMs for RNA Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA-associated interactions is essential for understanding cellular regulation and advancing drug discovery. While Biological Large Language Models (BioLLMs) such as ESM-2 and RiNALMo provide powerful sequence representations, existing methods rely on static fusion strategies that fail to capture the dynamic, context-dependent nature of molecular binding. We introduce CrossLLM-Mamba, a novel framework that reformulates interaction prediction as a state-space alignment problem. By leveraging bidirectional Mamba encoders, our approach enables deep ``crosstalk'' between modality-specific embeddings through hidden state propagation, modeling interactions as dynamic sequence transitions rather than static feature overlaps. The framework maintains linear computational complexity, making it scalable to high-dimensional BioLLM embeddings. We further incorporate Gaussian noise injection and Focal Loss to enhance robustness against hard-negative samples. Comprehensive experiments across three interaction categories, RNA-protein, RNA-small molecule, and RNA-RNA demonstrate that CrossLLM-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the RPI1460 benchmark, our model attains an MCC of 0.892, surpassing the previous best by 5.2\%. For binding affinity prediction, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.95 on riboswitch and repeat RNA subtypes. These results establish state-space modeling as a powerful paradigm for multi-modal biological interaction prediction.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Spectral Geometry of Biological Knowledge in Single-Cell Transformer Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT learn high-dimensional gene representations, but what biological knowledge these representations encode remains unclear. We systematically decode the geometric structure of scGPT internal representations through 63 iterations of automated hypothesis screening (183 hypotheses tested), revealing that the model organizes genes into a structured biological coordinate system rather than an opaque feature space.
  The dominant spectral axis separates genes by subcellular localization, with secreted proteins at one pole and cytosolic proteins at the other. Intermediate transformer layers transiently encode mitochondrial and ER compartments in a sequence that mirrors the cellular secretory pathway. Orthogonal axes encode protein-protein interaction networks with graded fidelity to experimentally measured interaction strength (Spearman rho = 1.000 across n = 5 STRING confidence quintiles, p = 0.017).
  In a compact six-dimensional spectral subspace, the model distinguishes transcription factors from their target genes (AUROC = 0.744, all 12 layers significant). Early layers preserve which specific genes regulate which targets, while deeper layers compress this into a coarser regulator versus regulated distinction. Repression edges are geometrically more prominent than activation edges, and B-cell master regulators BATF and BACH2 show convergence toward the B-cell identity anchor PAX5 across transformer depth. Cell-type marker genes cluster with high fidelity (AUROC = 0.851). Residual-stream geometry encodes biological structure complementary to attention patterns. These results indicate that biological transformers learn an interpretable internal model of cellular organization, with implications for regulatory network inference, drug target prioritization, and model auditing.</description>

      <title>VAE-MS: An Asymmetric Variational Autoencoder for Mutational Signature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutational signature analysis has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering the underlying biological processes driving cancer development. However, the signature extraction process, typically performed using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), often lacks reliability and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, several solutions have been introduced, including the use of neural networks to achieve more accurate estimates and probabilistic methods to better capture natural variation in the data. In this work, we introduce a Variational Autoencoder for Mutational Signatures (VAE-MS), a novel model that leverages both an asymmetric architecture and probabilistic methods for the extraction of mutational signatures. VAE-MS is compared to with three state-of-the-art models for mutational signature extraction: SigProfilerExtractor, the NMF-based gold standard; MUSE-XAE, an autoencoder that employs an asymmetric design without probabilistic components; and SigneR, a Bayesian NMF model, to illustrate the strength in combining a nonlinear extraction with a probabilistic model. In the ability to reconstruct input data and generalize to unseen data, models with probabilistic components (VAE-MS, SigneR) dramatically outperformed models without (SigProfilerExtractor, MUSE-XAE). The NMF-baed models (SigneR, SigProfilerExtractor) had the most accurate reconstructions in simulated data, while VAE-MS reconstructed more accurately on real cancer data. Upon evaluating the ability to extract signatures consistently, no model exhibited a clear advantage over the others. Software for VAE-MS is available at https://github.com/CLINDA-AAU/VAE-MS.</description>

      <title>What Topological and Geometric Structure Do Biological Foundation Models Learn? Evidence from 141 Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When biological foundation models such as scGPT and Geneformer process single-cell gene expression, what geometric and topological structure forms in their internal representations? Is that structure biologically meaningful or a training artifact, and how confident should we be in such claims? We address these questions through autonomous large-scale hypothesis screening: an AI-driven executor-brainstormer loop that proposed, tested, and refined 141 geometric and topological hypotheses across 52 iterations, covering persistent homology, manifold distances, cross-model alignment, community structure, and directed topology, all with explicit null controls and disjoint gene-pool splits.
  Three principal findings emerge. First, the models learn genuine geometric structure. Gene embedding neighborhoods exhibit non-trivial topology, with persistent homology significant in 11 of 12 transformer layers at p &lt; 0.05 in the weakest domain and 12 of 12 in the other two. A multi-level distance hierarchy shows that manifold-aware metrics outperform Euclidean distance for identifying regulatory gene pairs, and graph community partitions track known transcription factor target relationships. Second, this structure is shared across independently trained models. CCA alignment between scGPT and Geneformer yields canonical correlation of 0.80 and gene retrieval accuracy of 72 percent, yet none of 19 tested methods reliably recover gene-level correspondences. The models agree on the global shape of gene space but not on precise gene placement. Third, the structure is more localized than it first appears. Under stringent null controls applied across all null families, robust signal concentrates in immune tissue, while lung and external lung signals weaken substantially.</description>
