      <title>Commutators between coprime order elements in non-abelian simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations on the set of commutators between the elements of a finite group having relatively prime orders have prompt us to propose a variant of the Ore conjecture: For every finite non-abelian simple group and for every $g\in G$, there exist $x,y\in G$ with $g=[y,x]$ and with the order of $x$ relatively prime to the order of $y$. In this note we present some evidence towards the veracity of this conjecture by proving it for alternating groups and some sporadic simple groups.</description>

      <title>Continuous two-valued discrete-time dynamical systems and actions of two-valued groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continuous 2-valued dynamical systems with discrete time (dynamics) on $\mathbb{C}$. The main question addressed is whether a 2-valued dynamics can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group. We construct a class of strongly invertible continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ such that none of these dynamics can be given by the action of any 2-valued group. We also construct an example of a continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ that is not strongly invertible but can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group.</description>

      <title>Finite groups whose maximal subgroups have almost odd index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recurring theme in finite group theory is understanding how the structure of a finite group is determined by the arithmetic properties of group invariants. There are results in the literature determining the structure of finite groups whose irreducible character degrees, conjugacy class sizes or indices of maximal subgroups are odd. These results have been extended to include those finite groups whose character degrees or conjugacy class sizes are not divisible by $4$. In this paper, we determine the structure of finite groups whose maximal subgroups have index not divisible by $4$. As a consequence, we obtain some new $2$-nilpotency criteria.</description>

      <title>Semigroup Congruences and Subsemigroups of the Direct Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate semigroups $S$ which have the property that every subsemigroup of $S\times S$ which contains the diagonal $\{ (s,s)\colon s\in S\}$ is necessarily a congruence on $S$. We call such $S$ a DSC semigroup. It is well known that all finite groups are DSC, and easy to see that every DSC semigroup must be simple. Building on this, we show that for broad classes of semigroups -- including periodic, stable, inverse and several well-known types of simple semigroups -- the only DSC members are groups. However, it turns out that there exist non-group DSC semigroups, which we obtain utilising a construction introduced by Byleen for the purpose of constructing interesting congruence-free semigroups. Such examples can additionally be regular or bisimple.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Voronoi percolation in higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the uniqueness thresholds for Poisson-Voronoi percolation in symmetric spaces of connected higher rank semisimple Lie groups with property (T) converge to zero in the low-intensity limit. This phenomenon is fundamentally different from situations in which Poisson-Voronoi percolation has previously been studied.
  Our approach builds on a recent breakthrough of Fraczyk, Mellick and Wilkens (arXiv:2307.01194) and provides an alternative proof strategy for Gaboriau's fixed price problem. As a further application of our result, we give a new class of examples of non-amenable Cayley graphs that admit factor of iid bond percolations with a unique infinite cluster and arbitrarily small expected degree, answering a question inspired by Hutchcroft-Pete (Invent. math. 221 (2020)).}</description>

      <title>Degrees and prime power order zeros of characters of symmetric and alternating groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $p$-part of the degree of an irreducible character of a symmetric group is completely determined by the set of vanishing elements of $p$-power order. As a corollary we deduce that the set of zeros of prime power order controls the degree of such a character. The same problem is analysed for alternating groups, where we show that when $p=2$ this data can only be determined up to two possibilities. We prove analogous statements for the defect of the $p$-block containing the character and for the $p$-height of the character.</description>

      <title>Relative cubulation of relative strict hyperbolization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that many relatively hyperbolic groups obtained by relative strict hyperbolization admit a cocompact action on a CAT(0) cubical complex. Under suitable assumptions on the peripheral subgroups, these groups are residually finite and even virtually special. We include some applications to the theory of manifolds, such as the construction of new non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds with residually finite fundamental group, and the existence of non-triangulable aspherical manifolds with virtually special fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Coarse group theoretic study on stable mixed commutator length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. We study the large scale behavior, not the exact values themselves, of the stable mixed commutator length $scl_{G,N}$ on the mixed commutator subgroup $[G,N]$; when $N=G$, $scl_{G,N}$ equals the stable commutator length $scl_G$ on the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$. For this purpose, we regard $scl_{G,N}$ not only as a function from $[G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, but as a bi-invariant metric function $d^+_{scl_{G,N}}$ from $[G,N]\times [G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Our main focus is coarse group theoretic structures of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$. Our preliminary result (the absolute version) connects, via the Bavard duality, $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$ and the quotient vector space of the space of $G$-invariant quasimorphisms on $N$ over one of such homomorphisms. In particular, we prove that the dimension of this vector space equals the asymptotic dimension of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$.
  Our main result is the comparative version: we connect the coarse kernel, formulated by Leitner and Vigolo, of the coarse homomorphism $\iota_{G,N}\colon ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})\to ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G}})$; $y\mapsto y$, and a certain quotient vector space $W(G,N)$ of the space of invariant quasimorphisms. Assume that $N=[G,G]$ and that $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional with dimension $\ell$. Then we prove that the coarse kernel of $\iota_{G,N}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ as a coarse group. In contrast to the absolute version, the space $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional in many cases, including all $(G,N)$ with finitely generated $G$ and nilpotent $G/N$. As an application of our result, given a group homomorphism $\varphi\colon G\to H$ between finitely generated groups, we define an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map `inside' the groups, which is dual to the naturally defined $\mathbb{R}$-linear map from $W(H,[H,H])$ to $W(G,[G,G])$ induced by $\varphi$.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Generalisation of Rank two Complex Reflection Groups via Generators and Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex reflection groups of rank two are precisely the finite groups in the family of groups that we call J-reflection groups. These groups are particular cases of J-groups as defined by Achar &amp; Aubert in 2008. The family of J-reflection groups generalises both complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups, a family of groups defined and studied by Gobet. We give uniform presentations by generators and relations of J-reflection groups, which coincide with the presentations given by Brou\'e, Malle and Rouquier when the groups are finite. In particular, these presentations provide uniform presentations for complex reflection groups of rank two where the generators are reflections (however the proof uses the classification of irreducible complex reflection groups). Moreover, we show that the center of J-reflection groups is cyclic, generalising what happens for irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups. Finally, we classify J-reflection groups up to reflection isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>$G$-complete reducibility and saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16927v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H \subseteq G$ be connected reductive linear algebraic groups defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt; 0$. In our first main theorem we show that if a closed subgroup $K$ of $H$ is $H$-completely reducible, then it is also $G$-completely reducible in the sense of Serre, under some restrictions on $p$, generalising the known case for $G = GL(V)$. Our proof uses R.W. Richardson's notion of reductive pairs to reduce to the $GL(V)$ case. We study Serre's notion of saturation and prove that saturation behaves well with respect to products and regular subgroups. Our second main theorem shows that if $K$ is $H$-completely reducible, then the saturation of $K$ in $G$ is completely reducible in the saturation of $H$ in $G$ (which is again a connected reductive subgroup of $G$), under suitable restrictions on $p$, again generalising the known instance for $G = GL(V)$. We also study saturation of finite subgroups of Lie type in $G$. We show that saturation is compatible with standard Frobenius endomorphisms, and we use this to generalise a result due to Nori from 1987 in case $G = GL(V)$.</description>
