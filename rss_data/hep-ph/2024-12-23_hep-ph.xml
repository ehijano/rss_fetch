      <title>Improving the performance of weak supervision searches using data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak supervision combines the advantages of training on real data with the ability to exploit signal properties. However, training a neural network using weak supervision often requires an excessive amount of signal data, which severely limits its practical applicability. In this study, we propose addressing this limitation through data augmentation, increasing the training data's size and diversity. Specifically, we focus on physics-inspired data augmentation methods, such as $p_{\text{T}}$ smearing and jet rotation. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of weak supervision, enabling neural networks to learn efficiently from substantially less data.</description>

      <title>Confronting impact-parameter dependent model in next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD with combined HERA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, we present the CGC/saturation approach of Ref.[C.~Contreras, E.~Levin, R.~Meneses and M.~Sanhueza,Eur. Phys. J. C 80 (2020) no.11, 1029] and its parameters determined from the combined HERA data. This model features an analytical solution for the non-linear Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution equation and the exponential behavior of the saturation momentum on the impact parameter $b$-dependence, characterized by $Q_s\propto \exp(-mb)$. We compare our results with experimental data at small-$x$, including the proton structure function $F_2$, charm structure function $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$, and exclusive vector meson production. The model shows good agreement across a wide kinematic range. Our findings support using this approach for reliable predictions in upcoming experiments like the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and the LHeC.</description>

      <title>Global parameterizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering with dispersive constraints: beyond the S0 wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new global parameterizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering for the S2, P, D, F, and G partial waves up to at least 1.8 GeV, easy to implement for phenomenological use. With earlier S0-wave parameterizations, slightly updated here, they reproduce previous partial wave dispersion analyses up to the $\pi\omega$ threshold. In addition, these new parameterizations have improved their description of recent P-wave data, the inelasticity in various waves, and their fulfillment of Roy-like and forward dispersion relations. The latter now test very high partial waves and have an improved matching with the Regge regime, extending those with P-wave contributions up to 1.6 GeV. Above 1.6 GeV and up to 1.8 GeV, or sometimes somewhat beyond, the parameterizations are simple unconstrained fits to data.</description>

      <title>Implications of Higgs mass for hidden sector SUSY breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden sector SUSY breaking where charged hidden sector fields obtain SUSY breaking vevs once seemed common in dynamical SUSY breaking (DSB). In such a case, scalars can obtain large masses but gauginos and A-terms gain loop-suppressed anomaly-mediated contributions which may be smaller by factors of 1/16\pi^2 ~1/160. This situation leads to models such as PeV or mini-split supersymmetry with m(scalars)~ 160 m(gauginos). In order to generate a light Higgs mass m_h~ 125 GeV, the scalar mass terms are required in the 10-100 TeV range, leading to large, unnatural contributions to the weak scale. Alternatively, in gravity mediation with singlet hidden sector fields, then m(scalars)~ m(gauginos)~ A-terms and the large A-terms lift m_h -&gt;125 GeV even for natural values of m(stop1)~ 1-3 TeV. Requiring naturalness, which is probabilistically preferred by the string landscape, then the measured Higgs mass seems to favor singlets in the hidden sector, which can be common in metastable and retrofitted DSB models.</description>

      <title>On the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OKA Collaboration has obtained a new upper limit on the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay probability which is 65 times lower than the one currently listed by PDG. However it is still about $10^{4}$ times worse than the theoretical prediction. It was suggested that production of pionium $A_{2\pi}$ in the final state of the semileptonic $K^+$ decay with subsequent $A_{2\pi} \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ decay will increase the value of theoretical branching ratio due to the absence of five-particle phase space suppression. The estimates done in our paper show that despite the gain in the phase space the decay $K^+ \to A_{2\pi}\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ appeares to be strongly suppressed because of the smallness of the pionium wave function at zero $\pi$ mesons separation.</description>

      <title>Correlations of net baryon number and electric charge in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correlations between net baryon number and electric charge up to sixth order related to the interactions of nuclear matter at low temperature, and explore their relationship with the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition (LGPT) within the framework of the nonlinear Walecka model. The calculation shows that strong correlations between the baryon number and electric charge exist in the vicinity of LGPT, and the higher order correlations are more sensitive than the lower order ones near the phase transition. However, in the high-temperature region away from the LGPT the rescaled lower order correlations are relatively larger than most of the higher order ones. Besides, some of the fifth- and sixth-order correlations possibly change the sign from negative to positive along the chemical freeze-out line with the decrease of temperature. In combination with the future experimental projects at lower collision energies, the derived results can be referred to study the phase structure of strongly interacting matter and analyze the related experimental signals.</description>

      <title>Composite asymmetric dark matter with a dark photon portal: Multimessenger tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) is the framework that naturally explains the coincidence of the baryon density and the dark matter density of the Universe. Through a portal interaction sharing particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the Standard Model and dark sectors, dark matter particles, which are dark-sector counterparts of baryons, can decay into antineutrinos and dark-sector counterparts of mesons (dark mesons) or dark photon. Subsequent cascade decay of the dark mesons and the dark photon can also provide electromagnetic fluxes at late times of the Universe. We derive constraints on the lifetime of dark matter decay in the composite ADM scenario from the astrophysical observations of the $e^+$, $e^-$, and $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The constraints from cosmic-ray positron measurements by AMS-02 are the most stringent at $\gtrsim2$ GeV: a lifetime should be larger than the order of $10^{26}$ s, corresponding to the cutoff scale of the portal interaction of about $10^8 \text{--} 10^9 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. We also show the importance of neutrino observations with Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande, which give conservative bounds.</description>

      <title>A $Z_4$ symmetric inverse seesaw model for neutrino masses and FIMP dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical framework based on a spontaneously broken $Z_4$ symmetry is proposed to generate neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism and to facilitate dark matter production through a freeze-in scenario. The model introduces right-handed neutrinos $N_i$, additional fermions $\chi_i$, and a complex scalar $S$. The stability of the dark matter candidate is ensured by an unbroken $Z_2$ subgroup, and its relic abundance is predominantly produced through decay and scattering processes involving the heavy singlet fermions. Phenomenological analyses show that this relatively minimal construction naturally aligns the neutrino oscillation parameters with the latest global oscillation data. Furthermore, the observed dark matter relic density is successfully accounted for within the overlapping parameter space relevant to neutrino properties.</description>

      <title>Minimal structure for neutrino mass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking clue from the minimal structure of texture 4-zero hermitian mass matrices, which are very successful in accommodating quark mixing data, we propose a form of texture 2-zero complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix with only one phase parameter. This minimal mass matrix not only accommodates the available neutrino oscillation data, but also makes interesting predictions for the unknown parameters like the lightest neutrino mass $m_{\nu_1}$ (for normal ordering(NO)), Jarlskog's rephasing invariant $J_{CP}$, Dirac type CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ and effective neutrino mass $\left&lt; m_{ee} \right&gt;$. We also explore the correlations between the parameters of the model, that lead us to minimizing the parameters further.</description>

      <title>Five dimensional $SU(5) \times U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a grand unified model in five dimensions that addresses the strong CP problem. The boundary conditions responsible for breaking the GUT gauge group to the standard model gauge group also explain the mass splitting for new matter content required for gauge coupling unification and the emergence of the QCD axion from the $ U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ gauge field. The quality of the axion solution is ensured by the gauge symmetry. The proton decay rate, axion dark matter detection, and the cosmological aspects of our setup are also discussed. Notably, the proton decay signal is expected to be easily testable.</description>

      <title>$P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ decay into $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D}\Lambda_c$ and the spin of the $P_c$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of the width and spin assignment of the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ pentaquark states. We calculate the partial decays widths of the particles into $J/\psi N$, $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D} \Lambda_c$ with the first one obtained within a unitary approach with the coupled channels of $J/\psi N$ and $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ with the interaction driven by vector meson exchange, and the last two by means of triangle diagrams involving pion exchange which break the spin degeneracy of the vector meson exchange. The widths obtained depend much on the spin of the particles and we study the possible scenarios for spin assignment, favoring the $1/2^-$ , $3/2^-$ order. We predict values for decays in different channels and show that their determination would allow to decide unambiguously the spin of the states.</description>

      <title>Photon proliferation from $N$-body dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a photon proliferation effect from $N$-body dark matter (DM) annihilation in the early Universe, which can induce a drastic photon-temperature shift after neutrino decoupling. For pseudoscalar DM mass below the eV scale, we show that the photon proliferation effect becomes significant as the mass approaches the ultralight end, due to the huge enhancement from the background DM number density. This presents the leading constraints on the DM-photon coupling, DM self-interaction, and DM-electron coupling, which are stronger than the existing bounds up to several orders of magnitude. The present research can be extended to other interactions and DM candidates, and highlights the importance of multi-body processes in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Flavour anomalies and Machine Learning: an improved analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended analysis of our previous results on flavour anomalies in semileptonic rare $B$-meson decays using an effective field theory approach and assuming that new physics affects only one generation in the interaction basis and non-universal mixing effects are generated by the rotation to the mass basis. A global fit to experimental data is performed, focusing on LFU ratios $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $R_{J/\psi}$ and branching ratios that exhibit tensions with Standard Model predictions on $B \rightarrow K^{(*)} \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays. We use a Machine Learning Montecarlo algorithm in our analysis. Comparing three different scenarios, we show that the one that introduces only mixing between the second and third quark generations and no mixing in the lepton sector, as well as independent coefficients for the singlet and triplet four fermion effective operators, provides the best fit to experimental data. A comparison with our previous results is performed.</description>

      <title>What happens when supercooling is terminated by curvature flipping of the effective potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the nature of a certain type of supercooled phase transition, where the supercooling is guaranteed to end due to the curvature of the finite-temperature effective potential at the origin experiencing a sign flip at some temperature. In such models the potential barrier trapping the scalar field at the meta-stable origin is quickly vanishing at the temperature scale of the phase transition. It is therefore not immediately clear if critical bubbles are able to form, or whether the field will simply transition over the barrier and smoothly roll down to the true minimum. To address this question, we perform lattice simulations of a scalar potential exhibiting supercooling, with a small barrier around the origin, and qualitatively determine the fate of the phase transition. Our simulations indicate that, owing to the required flatness of the potential, the scalar field remains trapped around the origin such that the phase transition generically proceeds via the nucleation and expansion of true-vacuum bubbles. We comment on the possible gravitational wave signals one might expect in a concrete toy model and discuss the parameter space in which bubble percolation is and isn't expected.</description>

      <title>The QCD moat regime and its real-time properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense QCD matter may exhibit crystalline phases. Their existence is reflected in a moat regime, where mesonic correlations feature spatial modulations. We study the realtime properties of pions at finite temperature and density in QCD in order to elucidate the nature of this regime. We show that the moat regime arises from particle-hole-like fluctuations near the Fermi surface. This gives rise to a characteristic peak in the spectral function of the pion at nonzero \emph{spacelike} momentum. This peak can be interpreted as a new quasi particle, the moaton. In addition, our framework also allows us to directly test the stability of the homogeneous chiral phase against the formation of an inhomogeneous condensate in QCD. We find that the formation of such a phase is highly unlikely for baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B \leq 630$\,MeV.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass effects in off-light-cone distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop correction to the forward matrix element of an off-light-cone bi-local quark correlator characterised by a space-like separation $z^2$ in the presence of heavy quarks with mass $m$. This calculation allows us to extract the one-loop matching kernel, necessary to connect quasi and pseudo-distributions to collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), accounting for heavy-quark mass effects. Our result is exact in that it includes all powers of $z^2m^2$ at one loop in $\alpha_s$. In the limit $z^2m^2\rightarrow 0$, it consistently reduces to the known massless result. We also carry out an implementation of our expression, which allows us to compute the charm pseudo-distribution of the proton given its PDF. We finally comment on the quantitative impact of heavy-quark mass corrections.</description>

      <title>Dimension-8 operators in $W^+W^-$ production via gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dimension-8 operators on $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC for the incoming gluon-gluon channel. To this end, we have identified all dimension-8 CP-even operators contributing to the process in question, and computed the corresponding tree-level helicity amplitudes for fully-leptonic decays of the $W$ bosons. These are implemented in the program MCFM-RE, which automatically incorporates the effect of a jet-veto to reduce the otherwise overwhelming $t\bar t$ background. We find that, unless we break the hierarchy of the effective field theory (EFT), the interference of the dimension-8 operators with the Standard Model is negligible across the considered distributions. This justifies including the square of dimension-6 operators when performing EFT fits with this channel. We then present new constraints on CP-even and CP-odd dimension-6 operators within the EFT regime. Lastly, we postulate a scenario in which the hierarchy of the EFT is broken, justified by the strong constraints on dimension-6 operators from existing on-shell Higgs data. In this scenario, we discuss the constraints that can be reasonably set on CP-even dimension-8 operators with current and future data. We remark that the effect of the jet-veto on the ability to constrain new physics in the $W^+W^-$ channel is quite dramatic and must be properly taken into account.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV and probing new physics of the seesaw scale poses a great challenge. A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. Under the neutrino seesaw mechanism, fluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing to the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization of QCD in $1 + 1$ dimensions: four-fermion interactions from quark-gluon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. We use a functional formulation with covariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the gauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local fermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of quark matter and in-medium properties of mesons from Callan-Symanzik flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute meson spectral functions at finite temperature and density in the quark-meson model, supplemented with a computation of the phase diagram. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the non-analytic structure of the meson two-point functions which is of great relevance for phenomenological applications, such as moat regimes and inhomogeneous phases. Furthermore, it is also relevant from a field-theoretical standpoint as it provides an insight into the applicability of derivative expansions of the effective action to studies of general fermion-boson models, both at zero and finite chemical potential. Our computation is based on a functional renormalization group setup that preserves causality, all spacetime symmetries, and the Silver-Blaze property. The combination of these properties can only be achieved by a Callan-Symanzik regulator. Instead of momentum shell integrations, renormalization group flows generated by such a regulator describe the change of the theory induced by a change of the masses of the mesons and quarks. A particular focus of our work lies on the construction of controlled Callan-Symanzik flows in the presence of spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking by means of chiral Ward-Takahashi identities.</description>

      <title>Fully heavy asymmetric scalar tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar tetraquarks $T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ with asymmetric contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c}\overline{b}$ are explored using the QCD sum rule method. These states are modeled as the diquark-antidiquarks composed of the axial-vector components. The masses and current couplings of $T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The predictions obtained for the masses of these four-quark mesons prove that they are unstable against the strong two-meson fall-apart decays to conventional mesons. In the case of the tetraquark $ T_{b}$ this is the decay $T_{\mathrm{b}}\to \eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The processes $T_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are kinematically allowed decay modes of the tetraquark $ T_{c}$. The widths of corresponding processes are evaluated by employing the QCD three-point sum rule approach which are necessary to estimate strong couplings at the tetraquark-meson-meson vertices of interest. The mass $ m=(15697 \pm 95)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T_b]=(36.0 \pm 10.2)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the tetraquark $T_{b}$ as well as the parameters $ \widetilde{m}=(9680 \pm 102)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[T_c]=(54.7 \pm 9.9)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the case of $T_{c}$ provide useful information to search for and interpret new exotic states.</description>

      <title>Electroweak corrections in the SMEFT: four-fermion operators at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model (SM), electroweak (EW) corrections become significant at high energies, particularly at the tera-electronvolt scale and beyond, due to the presence of Sudakov logarithms. At these energy scales, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework provides an enhanced sensitivity to potential new physics effects. This motivates the inclusion of EW corrections not only for SM predictions but also for analyses within SMEFT. In this work, we compute EW corrections in the high-energy limit for a selected set of dimension-six operators, specifically the class of four-fermion contact interactions, in key hard-scattering processes relevant to both current and future colliders: top-quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in a muon collider scenario, as well as the Drell-Yan process at the LHC. We first discuss the technical details and challenges associated with evaluating EW Sudakov logarithms in SMEFT, contrasting them with the SM case. We then present phenomenological results for the aforementioned processes, highlighting the non-trivial effects introduced by EW corrections arising from the insertion of dimension-six, four-fermion operators. Importantly, the resulting $K$-factors exhibit significant deviations from their SM counterparts, with dependencies not only on the process but also on the specific operators considered. Finally, we explore the potential to lift flat directions in the SMEFT parameter space by incorporating higher-order corrections, using Fisher information techniques.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the complete computation of the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections to the neutral-current Drell-Yan process. Our calculation holds in the entire range of dilepton invariant masses. We present phenomenological results for several kinematical distributions in the case of bare muons both in the resonant region and for high invariant masses. We also consider the forward-backward asymmetry, which is a key observable to measure the weak mixing angle. We finally extend our calculation to dressed leptons and compare our results in the massless limit to those available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Flavor Violations in $B$-Mesons within Non-Minimal SU(5)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent anomalies in $B$-meson decays, such as deviations in $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$, suggest possible lepton flavor universality violation and new exotic interactions. In this work, we explore these anomalies within a non-minimal SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) framework, which introduces a 45-dimensional Higgs representation predicting exotic scalar particles, including the leptoquark $R_2$ and diquark $S_6$. The $R_2$ leptoquark addresses charged current anomalies in $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions, the $S_6$ diquark contributes to nonleptonic neutral current processes, such as $B\to K\pi$ while at the loop level, the exchange of a leptoquark and diquark contributes to $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$ offering solutions to longstanding puzzles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential for extracting the longitudinal proton structure function $F_{L}$ at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) through a Rosenbluth separation method. The impacts of differing assumptions on sample sizes, systematic uncertainties and beam energy scenarios are investigated. With a sufficiently large number of centre of mass energy configurations and well-controlled systematics, the EIC will measure $F_{L}$ to an unprecedented precision, even with relatively modest luminosities. The accessible kinematic range complements both fixed target and HERA data. In the most optimistic scenarios, the EIC data will be a highly competitive direct probe of the proton gluon density.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In models of dark matter composed of feebly interacting ultralight bosons in the state of Bose-Einstein condensate, the dynamical friction force acting on circularly moving globular clusters modelled as Plummer spheres is determined. Analytic expressions for both radial and tangential components of the dynamical friction force are given. We reveal that the dynamical friction force for the Plummer sphere deviates from that for a point probe of the same mass for the significantly large ratio of the Plummer sphere radius to its orbital radius as well as for large values of the Mach number.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations for the evolution of the order parameter in space and time, such as the Langevin equation. We demonstrate that the ordinary differential equations governing either the temporal or spatial dependence in the Langevin equation provide surprisingly substantial insights into the dynamics of the phase transition. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time, which is crucial to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In particular, Bernoulli differential equations that arise in the overdamped case can be solved analytically. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. Apart from the fundamental insights into the KZM, this finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales, which would otherwise be difficult to achieve with numerical simulations of the full partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Three-Flavor Neutrino Oscillations on an NMR Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer using the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) theory in close analogy to the physical processes realized in experiments. We simulate three-flavor neutrino oscillations on a two-qubit NMR quantum information processor. The three-flavor neutrino states were encoded into the two-qubit system, leaving one redundant basis state (representing an unphysical sterile neutrino). We simulated the neutrino oscillations in different scenarios, including propagation in vacuum and through surrounding matter, and both with and without a CP violating phase $\delta$ at a Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) baseline distance of L = 1285 km. The oscillation probabilities were obtained after unitarily time evolving the initial flavor state and and comparisons were performed between different scenarios. Further, we design and implement an optimized quantum circuit encoding all four parameters (three mixing angles-$\theta_{12},\theta_{23},\theta_{13}$ and one complex phase $\delta$) to implement the PMNS unitary matrix, which relates the flavor and mass eigenstates. The interaction with matter is considered as a perturbation to the vacuum Hamiltonian, and the same quantum circuit is employed with an approximation of two mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{13}$ ) and mass eigenvalues. Our experimental results match well with numerical simulations and highlight the potential of quantum computers for exploring the physics of neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Quark-Quark and Quark-nucleon Potential model Extended-soft-core meson-exchange Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quark-quark (QQ) and Quark-nucleon (QN) interactions in this paper are derived from the Extended-soft-core (ESC) interactions. The meson-quark-quark (MQQ) vertices are determined in the framework of the constituent quark model (CQM). These vertices are such that upon folding with the ground-state baryon quark wave functions the one-boson-exchange (OBE) amplitudes for baryon-baryon (BB), and in particularly for nucleon-nucleon (NN), are reproduced. This opens the attractive possibility to define meson-quark interactions at the quark level which are directly related related to the interactions at the baryon level. the latter have been determined by the baryon-baryon data. Application of these "realistic" quark-quark interactions in the quark-matter phase is presumably of relevance for the description of highly condensed matter, as e.g. neutron-star matter.</description>

      <title>The hadronic decay of vector charmonium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraction of decay parameters using lattice techniques is a computationally expensive task, requiring several volumes and group irreps to relate the spectrum on a lattice simulation to the infinite volume scattering. In this project we employ an alternative method based on a narrow-width approximation to extract the hadronic mixing $&lt;\bar{D}D|\psi(3770)&gt;$, which is needed to compute the decay $\Gamma(\psi(3770)\to\bar{D}D)$ between the second excited state of vector charmonium and a pair of $D$-mesons in a $p$-wave. We carry out our lattice simulations on two CLS ensembles at $m_\pi \sim 440~\text{MeV}$ and $a\sim 0.066~\text{fm}$ and obtain results compatible with experiment. Furthermore, we interpret our results analytically using the ${}^3P_0$ quark model.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Description of 2+1 Dimensional Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective metric description of 2+1 dimensional black holes describing deviations from the classical Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. The latter is a classical 2+1 dimensional rotating black hole with constant negative curvature. The effective metric is constrained by imposing the black hole symmetries and asymptotic classical behavior. The deformed metric is parametrized in terms of a physical quantity that we choose to be a physical distance. The latter can be solved for in three main regions of interest, the one around the horizon, origin, and spatial infinity. The finiteness of physical quantities at the horizon, such as the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, leads to universal constraints on the physical parameters of the metric around the horizon. This allows us to further derive the general form of the corrected Hawking temperature in terms of the physical parameters of the effective metric. Assuming that the approach can be generalized to the interior of the black hole, we further develop an effective metric description near the origin. To illustrate the approach, we show how to recast the information encoded in a specific model of quantum BTZ known as quBTZ black hole in terms of the effective metric coefficients.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reduction without Integration-By-Parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interesting study of Feynman integral reduction that does not employ integration-by-parts identities. Our approach proceeds by studying the equivalence relations of integral contours in the Feynman parameterization. We find that the integration contour can take a more general form than that given by the Cheng-Wu theorem. We apply this idea to one-loop integrals, and derive universal reduction formulas that can be used to efficiently reduce any one-loop integral. We expect that this approach can be useful in the reduction of multi-loop integrals as well.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) approach, we present a fluid-dynamical approach to solving flow equations for models living in a multi-dimensional field space. To this end, the underlying exact flow equation of the effective potential is reformulated as a set of nonlinear advection-diffusion-type equations which can be solved using the Kurganov-Tadmor central scheme, a modern finite-volume discretization from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing explicit benchmark tests using zero-dimensional models with two discretized field space directions or two symmetry invariants. Our techniques can be directly applied to flow equations of effective potentials of general (fermion-)boson systems with multiple invariants or condensates, as we also demonstrate for two concrete examples in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Size Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. Along with strong lensing studies and nearby galaxy observations, these could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos with a blue, tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$). We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10}~ M_{\odot}$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>The gauge symmetry violation in the QCD ground state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to report on convincing progress made in the investigation of the one of the true dynamical and gauge structures of the QCD ground state (vacuum). It also sheds new significunt insights into a mass squared dynamical generation in it. For this purpose, we use only the tensor algebra derivation rigorous rules in dealing with the corresponding skeleton loop integrals, contributing into the full gluon self-energy. The novel constraint on any solution to QCD has been exactly and uniquely derived in the framework of the Slavnov-Taylor identities for the gauge particles propagators. Its general solution makes it possible tpprove that the gauge symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is groken in its state. The dynamical source of this effect has to be identified with the constant tadpole term, having the dimension of a mass squared. The exact proof has been given that it cannot be disregarded from the theory and its ground state by ant means. The gauge symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian forbids such kind of terms, but the perturbative renormalizability of the theory will not be affected. The particular solution of the novel constraint describes the gluon field configurations with unbroken gauge symmetry in the QCD vacuum. The solution with broken gauge symmetry dominates over the solution with unbroken one at large distances, while being in agreement with it at short distances.</description>

      <title>Revealing the mystery of the double charm tetraquark in $pp$ collision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to probe the nature of the double charm tetraquark through the prompt production asymmetry between $T_{\bar{c}\bar{c}}^-$ and $T_{cc}^+$ in $pp$ collisions. When comparing two theoretical pictures, i.e. the compact tetraquark and hadronic molecular pictures, we find that the former one exhibits a significantly larger production asymmetry, enabling the unambiguous determination of the tetraquark's internal structure. Additionally, distinctive differences in the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of $T_{\bar{c}\bar{c}}^-$ and $T_{cc}^+$ cross sections emerge, particularly at $p_\mathrm{T}\approx 2~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $y\approx \pm 6$ at a center-of-mass energy of 14$~\mathrm{TeV}$. The insignificant asymmetry in hadronic molecular picture is because that hadronic molecules are produced in hadronic phase, where the phase space of their constituents needs to be taken into account rigorously. Our work can be extended to the exploration of other double heavy tetraquark candidates, offering a versatile approach to advance our understanding of exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Nucleation and Off-Equilibrium Effects in High-Temperature Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study real-time nucleation in perturbative high-temperature quantum field theories. Specifically, we consider the evolution of thermal particles driven out of equilibrium by nucleation. These particles form the thermal bath for the nucleating bubbles, and their off-equilibrium dynamics back-react on the bubbles, modifying the nucleation rates. Utilizing kinetic Boltzmann descriptions for the thermal particles, we derive modifications to Langer's nucleation rate arising from the off-equilibrium effects, unaccounted for in Linde's thermal rate. Importantly, we establish a connection to equilibrium computations of nucleation rates, particularly with the effective field theory approach, showing that they correctly capture the leading parts of the logarithm of the rate. We also show that the dominant damping of nucleation from a light bosonic quantum field arises from its corresponding long-wavelength classical modes, rather than the associated hard particles. This work provides a foundation for further studies of off-equilibrium effects in nucleation rates for realistic Standard Model extensions.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the modeling of the hadronic phase of QCD at finite magnetic field in the framework of hadron resonance gas (HRG). We focus on the statistical description of particle yields that include contribution from resonance decays. We demonstrate that the swift increase in the number of protons with magnetic field predicted in the HRG is due to the ill-defined description of higher-spin states. We discuss fluctuations of conserved charges and show that at present the qualitative comparison of the model predictions with the Lattice QCD data should be treated with care. We also discuss the principle of detailed balance which allows to study the magnetic field dependence of neutral resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate minimal scalar leptoquark models that dynamically generate neutrino Majorana masses at the one-loop level and examine their implications for low-energy processes. We show that these models can produce viable neutrino masses, consistent with neutrino oscillation and cosmological data. By using leptoquark couplings fixed by neutrino data, we predict additional contributions to neutrinoless double-beta decays ($0\nu\beta\beta$), which are chirality enhanced and compete with the standard contributions from the Majorana masses. Our analysis demonstrates that these effects are sizable for leptoquark masses as large as $\mathcal{O}(300~\mathrm{TeV})$, potentially increasing or decreasing the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life, and creating an ambiguity between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between $0\nu\beta\beta$ and flavor observables, such as kaon decays and $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, emphasizing that the latter is complementary to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

We consider Hermiticity and renormalizability a criterion to define the derivative Elko-Higgs interaction as the suitable candidate for a dark coupling. Then, the free parameters of the model are fixed by cosmological constraints on the dark matter abundance, bounds on the Higgs invisible decays, and limits on the electron-dark matter scattering mediated by the Higgs.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of the Regge-eikonal model of hadron interaction based on the analyticity of the scattering amplitude with taking into account the hadron structure, a simultaneous analysis is carried out of 90 sets of data. These sets include the data were obtained at low energies ($\sqrt{s} &gt; 3.6 $ GeV and high energies at FNAL, ISR, $SP\bar{P}S$, TEVATRON and LHC with 4326 experimental points, including the data of $A_N$. The energy and momentum transfer dependence of separate sets of data is analyzed on the basis of the eikonalized Born amplitude with taking into account two additional anomalous terms. Different origins of the nonlinear behavior of the slope of the scattering amplitude are compared. No contribution of hard-Pomeron in the elastic hadron scattering is found. The importance of Odderon's contribution is presented. In the framework of the HEGS model, using the electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic form factors, the differential cross sections in the CNI region and at large $t$ are described well in a wide energy region simultaneously. It is shown that the cross-even part includes the soft pomeron and the additional term with a large slope have energy dependence $\ln^2(s)$. The cross-odd part includes the maximal odderon term with $\ln^{2}(s)$ and an additional oscillation term with $\ln(s)$. It is shown that the additional terms with large slope are proportional to charge distributions but the maximal odderon term and oscillation term are proportional to matter distributions. Also, a good description of proton-neutron differential scattering with 526 experimental points is obtained on the basis of the amplitudes taken from the analysis of $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ scattering. A good description of the $A_N$ data was also obtained.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors in kinetic theory for a mixture of quark and gluon fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exactly solve an RTA-Boltzmann equation that describes the dynamics of coupled massless quark and gluon fluids undergoing transversally homogeneous longitudinal boost-invariant expansion. We include a fugacity parameter that allows quarks to be out of chemical equilibrium and we account for the different collision rates of quarks and gluons, which are related by Casimir scaling. Based on these assumptions, we numerically determine the evolution of a large set of moments of the quark and gluon distribution functions and reconstruct their entire distribution functions. We find that both late and early-time attractors exist for all moments of the distribution functions containing more than one power of the squared longitudinal momentum. These attractors emerge long before the system reaches the regime where hydrodynamic approximations apply. In addition, we discuss how the shear viscous corrections and entropy density of the fluid mixture evolve and consider the properties of their respective attractors. Finally, the entropy production is also investigated for different initial values of momentum anisotropy and quark abundance.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$-decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the determinations of the QCD condensates within the SVZ expansion in the axial-vector (A) channel using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) ${\cal R}_{10}^A(\tau)$ within stability criteria and $\tau$-like higher moments ${R}_{n,A}$ within stability for arbitrary $\tau$-mass squared $s_0$. We find the same violation of the factorization by a factor 6 of the four-quark condensate as from $e^+e^- \to$ Hadrons data. One can notice a systematic alternate sign and no exponential growth of the size of these condensates. Then, we extract $\alpha_s$ from the lowest $\tau$-decay like moment and find: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{V-A}=0.3135(83)$ (FO) and 0.3322 (81) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{V-A}=0.1177(10)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1200(9)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$\,(CI). We extend the analysis to the V--A channel and find: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{V-A}=0.3135(83)$ (FO) and 0.3322 (81) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{V-A}=0.1177(10)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1200(9)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$\,(CI). We observe that in different channels ($e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons, \, A,\,V-A), the extraction of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ at the observed $\tau$-mass leads to an overestimate of its value. Our determinations from these different channels lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3140(44)$ (FO) and 0.3346 (35) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1178(6)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1202(4)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$(CI). Comparisons with some other results are done.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group running of dimension-8 four-fermion operators in the SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the renormalization-group equations governing the evolution of dimension-8 four-fermion operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We describe the calculation and present analytic results for both the full flavor structure of the SMEFT and with the assumption of minimal flavor violation. We present numerical results for the renormalization-group evolution of the coefficients, and study their impact on fits of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Drell-Yan data. The effects of running on the dimension-8 coefficients can reach 50\% or more when evolving from 10 TeV scale down to few-GeV energies relevant for the analysis of fixed-target data. However, the impact of the dimension-8 running on the analysis of Drell-Yan data from the LHC is minimal.</description>

      <title>Improved Treatment of Bosonic Dark Matter Dynamics in Neutron Stars: Consequences and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conceivable that a bosonic dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with SM particles will be accumulated at the center of a neutron star (NS) and can lead to black hole formation. In contrast to previous works with a fixed NS temperature, we dynamically determine the formation of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for a given set of DM parameters, namely the DM-neutron scattering cross-section ($\sigma_{\chi n}$), the thermal average of DM annihilation cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$) and the DM mass ($m_\chi$). For both non-annihilating and annihilating DM with $\langle\sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-26}{~\rm cm^3~ s^{-1}}$, the BEC forms for $m_\chi \lesssim 10$ TeV. In case of non-annihilating DM, observations of old NS allows $\sigma_{\chi n}\lesssim 10^{-52}~{\rm cm^2}$ for $10 {~\rm MeV} \leq m_{\chi} \lesssim 10 {~\rm GeV}$ (with BEC) and $\sigma_{\chi n}\lesssim 10^{-47}~{\rm cm^2}$ for $5 {~\rm TeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 30 {~\rm PeV} $ (without BEC). This analysis shows that the electroweak mass window, $10 {~\rm GeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 5 {~\rm TeV}$ is essentially unconstrained by NS observations and therefore is subject only to direct detection experiments. In the annihilating DM scenario, the exclusion limits on DM parameters become weaker and even vanish for typical WIMP annihilation cross-section. However, the late-time heating of the NS enables us to probe the region with $\sigma_{\chi n}\gtrsim 10^{-47}~{\rm cm^2}$, using the James Webb Space Telescope in the foreseeable future. When our results are viewed in the context of indirect searches of DM, it provides a lower limit on the $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, which is sensitive to the DM thermal state.</description>

      <title>Density correlations under global and local charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a formalism to compute spatial $n$-point correlations of a conserved charge density in a large thermal system in the canonical ensemble, with explicit results presented up to 4th order. The resulting correlators contain local and balancing terms expressed through the grand-canonical susceptibilities for any equation of state. The new formalism is used to introduce a Gaussian local baryon number conservation in (spatial) rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at LHC conditions through a modulation of the balancing term. Connection to the conservation volume $V_c$ approach is established, indicating that the latter is appropriate for observables within a limited range around midrapidity. Quantitative analysis of the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration on net proton cumulants in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV shows significant evidence for local baryon conservation.</description>

      <title>Magnetized neutral 2SC color superconductivity and possible origin of the inner magnetic field of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the neutral 2SC phase of color superconductivity is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field and for diquark coupling constants and baryonic densities that are expected to characterize neutron stars. Specifically, the behavior of the charged gluons Meissner masses is investigated in the parameter region of interest taking into account, in addition, the contribution of a rotated magnetic field. It is found that up to moderately-high diquark coupling constants the mentioned Meissner masses become tachyonic independently of the applied magnetic-field amplitude, hence signalizing the chromomagnetic instability of this phase. To remove the instability, the restructuring of the system ground state is proposed, which now will be formed by vortices of the rotated charged gluons. These vortices boost the applied magnetic field having the most significant increase for relatively low applied magnetic fields. Finally, considering that with the stellar rotational frequency observed for magnetars a field of the order of $10^8$ G can be generated by dynamo effect, we show that by the boosting effect just described the field can be amplified to $10^{17}$ G that is in the range of inner core fields expected for magnetars. Thus, we conclude that the described mechanism could be the one responsible for the large fields characterizing magnetars if the cores of these compact objects are formed by neutral 2SC matter.</description>

      <title>Angular integrals with three denominators via IBP, mass reduction, dimensional shift, and differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>

Abstract: A number of new balloon or space-based gamma-ray observatories have been proposed to close a "MeV gap" in sensitivity to gamma rays in the MeV-GeV energy band. One aspect of the science case for these instruments is their ability to constrain or discover decaying or annihilating dark matter. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of these instruments for dark matter annihilation or decay for a range of possible Standard Model final states and compare to existing bounds.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the minimal set of leptoquarks into the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos, capable of generating radiative masses for active neutrinos. As a main consequence, the standard neutrinos acquire small Majorana masses at the one-loop level, while right-handed (sterile) neutrinos obtain small Majorana masses at the two-loop level, naturally making them light particles as well. Additionally, we discuss the viability of this scenario and several other interesting phenomenological consequences, including its impact on $B$-meson physics and rare Higgs decays, both of which are also induced by the leptoquarks.</description>

Abstract: The ability to model and sample from conditional densities is important in many physics applications. Implicit quantile networks (IQN) have been successfully applied to this task in domains outside physics. In this work, we illustrate the potential of IQNs as components of emulators using the simulation of jets as an example. Specifically, we use an IQN to map jets described by their 4-momenta at the generation level to jets at the event reconstruction level. The conditional densities emulated by our model closely match those generated by $\texttt{Delphes}$, while also enabling faster jet simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metric, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the renormalization analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present new constraints on the velocity-independent cross section of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter particles obtained with SRG/ART-XC after 4 full-sky surveys. These constraints are derived from observations of the Milky Way Halo, 33 Local Group spheroidal dwarf (dSph) galaxies and separately for the dSph galaxy Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. The constraints from the Milky Way Halo are the strongest among others and among all available in literature for this class of Dark Matter models with particle masses from 4 to 15 keV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the occurrence of Sound Speed Resonances (SSR) in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation across a wide range of coupling functions and parameters. After inflation, the damped oscillations of the inflaton around its potential minimum induces damped oscillations of the sound speed of tensor modes, leading to resonant amplification of the latter. Once the inflaton stabilizes around the minimum, the tensor sound speed reduces to unity (speed of light). In the context of multi-field inflation, the sound speed oscillations can be followed by a second phase of inflation, resulting in a distinctive stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). We show that these GW signals can be probed by upcoming experiments such as $\textbf{SKA}$, $\textbf{DECIGO}$, and $\textbf{BBO}$ depending on the duration of the second inflationary phase.</description>

      <title>Production and study of antideuterium with the GBAR beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential of circulating antideuterons ($\mathrm{\overline{d}}$) in the AD/ELENA facility at CERN is under active investigation. Approximately 100 $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ per bunch could be delivered as a $100\,\mathrm{keV}$ beam based on measured cross-sections. These $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ could be further decelerated to $12\,\mathrm{keV}$ using the GBAR scheme, enabling the synthesis of antideuterium ($\mathrm{\overline{D}}$) via charge exchange with positronium, a technique successfully demonstrated with $6\,\mathrm{keV}$ antiprotons for antihydrogen production. The AD/ELENA facility is currently studying the possibility of increasing the $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ rate using an optimized new target geometry. Assuming this is feasible, we propose further enhancing the anti-atom production by using laser-excited positronium in the $2P$ state within a cavity, which is expected to increase the $\mathrm{\overline{D}}(2S)$ production cross-section by almost an order of magnitude for $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ with $2\,\mathrm{keV}$ energy. We present the projected precision for measuring the antideuterium Lamb shift and extracting the antideuteron charge radius, as a function of the beam flux.</description>

      <title>The Status of Neutrino Cosmology: Standard $\Lambda$CDM, Extensions, and Tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus on neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine combinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey data, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$). Our results show upper limits in the range of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 76.9\,\mathrm{meV}$ to $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 108\,\mathrm{meV}$ (95\% CL). The variation in the limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the separate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and its relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\Sigma m_\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\Lambda$CDM, we find a $1.47\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO), with similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong constraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at $1.36\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the shape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\Sigma m_\nu &gt; 0$, is only present at less than $2\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra relativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.5$, alleviate the Hubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV partially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is included, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.

      <title>The Equivalence Theorem at work: manifestly gauge-invariant Abelian Higgs model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the Equivalence Theorem from an algebraic viewpoint, using an extended BRST symmetry. This version of the Equivalence Theorem is then used to reexpress the Abelian Higgs model action, originally written in terms of undesirable gauge variant field excitations, in terms of gauge-invariant, physical variables, corresponding to the Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi composite operators in the original field formulation. Although the ensuing action encompasses an infinite number of vertices and appears to be nonrenormalizable from the powercounting viewpoint, it nevertheless is renormalizable, thanks to the hidden equivalence with the original model. Hence, manifestly gauge-invariant computations are possible. We present an explicit illustration in terms of the gauge-invariant scalar field, its Green's function and corresponding pole mass.</description>
