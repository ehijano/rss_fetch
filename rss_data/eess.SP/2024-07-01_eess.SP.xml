      <title>Multi-Satellite MIMO Systems for Direct User-Satellite Communications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in satellite technology have made direct-to-device connectivity a viable solution for ensuring global access. This method is designed to provide internet connectivity to remote, rural, or underserved areas where traditional cellular or broadband networks are lacking or insufficient. This paper is a survey providing an in-depth review of multi-satellite Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems as a potential solution for addressing the link budget challenge in direct user-satellite communication. Special attention is given to works considering multi-satellite MIMO systems, both with and without satellite collaboration. In this context, collaboration refers to sharing data between satellites to improve the performance of the system. This survey begins by explaining several fundamental aspects of satellite communications (SatComs), which are vital prerequisites before investigating the multi-satellite MIMO systems. These aspects encompass satellite orbits, the structure of satellite systems, SatCom links, including the inter-satellite links (ISL) which facilitate satellite cooperation, satellite frequency bands, satellite antenna design, and satellite channel models, which should be known or estimated for effective data transmission to and from multiple satellites. Furthermore, this survey distinguishes itself by providing more comprehensive insights in comparison to other surveys. It specifically delves into the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) within the channel model section. It goes into detail about ISL noise and channel models, and it extends the ISL section by thoroughly investigating hybrid FSO/RF ISLs. Furthermore, analytical comparisons of simulation results from these works are presented to highlight the advantages of employing multi-satellite MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Replication of filtered interferometer measurements in interstellar communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar communication signals have been conjectured to be present, albeit difficult to identify. Experiments conducted since 2018 indicate an anomalous presence of a type of speculated interstellar signal, delta-t delta-f polarized pulse pairs, thought to be possibly sourced from a celestial direction near 5.25 hr Right Ascension and -7.6 deg. Declination. A recent experiment utilizing a radio interferometer identified anomalous pulse pairs associated with these celestial coordinates. The experiment is described in arXiv:2404.08994. Other experiments produced anomalous results, reported in arXiv:2105.03727, arXiv:2106.10168, arXiv:2202.12791 and arXiv:2203.10065. After the recent experiment was concluded, the interferometer antenna elements were modified to have increased aperture and reduction in radio interference-caused false positives. An experiment was conducted to attempt replication of the previously reported interferometer measurements. Observations are reported here. Apparent replicated falsification of an expected random white noise explanatory hypothesis compels the development and testing of alternate and auxiliary hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Machine-Type Communication Waveforms: An Exploration of New Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives a generalized class of waveforms with an application to machine-type communication (MTC) while studying its underlying structural characteristics in relation to conventional modulation waveforms. First, a canonical waveform of frequency-error tolerance is identified for a unified preamble and traffic signal design, ideal for MTC use as a composite waveform, commonly known as a transmission burst. It is shown that the most widely used modulation schemes for mIoT traffic signals, e.g., FSK and LoRa modulation, are simply subsets of the canonical waveform. The intrinsic characteristics and degrees of freedom the waveform offers are then explored. Most significantly, a new waveform dimension is uncovered and exploited as additional degrees of freedom for satisfying the MTC requirements, i.e., energy and resource efficiency and robustness. The corresponding benefits are evaluated analytically and numerically in AWGN, frequency-flat, and selective channels. We demonstrate that neither FSK nor LoRa can fully address the mIoT requirements since neither fully exploits the degrees of freedom from the perspective of the generalized waveform class. Finally, a solution is devised to optimize energy and resource efficiency under various deployment environments and practical constraints while maintaining the low-complexity property.</description>

      <title>MIMO-NOMA Enabled Sectorized Cylindrical Massive Antenna Array for HAPS with Spatially Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high altitude platform station (HAPS) technology is garnering significant interest as a viable technology for serving as base stations in communication networks. However, HAPS faces the challenge of high spatial correlation among adjacent users' channel gains which is due to the dominant line-of-sight (LoS) path between HAPS and terrestrial users. Furthermore, there is a spatial correlation among antenna elements of HAPS that depends on the propagation environment and the distance between elements of the antenna array. This paper presents an antenna architecture for HAPS and considers the mentioned issues by characterizing the channel gain and the spatial correlation matrix of the HAPS. We propose a cylindrical antenna for HAPS that utilizes vertical uniform linear array (ULA) sectors. Moreover, to address the issue of high spatial correlation among users, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) clustering method is proposed. An algorithm is also developed to allocate power among users to maximize both spectral efficiency and energy efficiency while meeting quality of service (QoS) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) conditions. Finally, simulation results indicate that the spatial correlation has a significant impact on spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in multiple antenna HAPS systems.</description>

      <title>Time Index Modulation-Driven Standalone RIS Mechanism for Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising demand for energy and spectrum resources in next-generation Internet-of-things (IoT) systems accounts for innovative modes of information and power transfer. One potential solution is to harness the active transmission capability of devices to facilitate data transmission and wireless energy harvesting (WEH) for backscatter communication so as to form a symbiotic radio (SR) environment in a mutualistic manner. Additionally, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) into the SR environment can provide an additional link and enhance the reliability of backscatter communication, thereby reinforcing the symbiotic relationships between active and passive devices. This paper proposes a novel SR system where a standalone RIS sustains its functions through WEH based on a low-power RIS structure and establishes mutualistic symbiosis by utilizing a signal conveyed by the primary transmitter (PTx) to assist ongoing transmissions and convey information to the primary receiver (PRx). The PTx employs time index modulation (TIM) to transmit information to the PRx and power to the RIS and energy harvester (EH). A log-likelihood ratio (LLR)-based detector is presented to address challenges in the TIM scheme. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is investigated in terms of harvested direct current (DC) power at the RIS and EH, as well as the bit error rate (BER) at the PRx.</description>

      <title>Channel Modeling Aided Dataset Generation for AI-Enabled CSI Feedback: Advances, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI-enabled autoencoder has demonstrated great potential in channel state information (CSI) feedback in frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. However, this method completely changes the existing feedback strategies, making it impractical to deploy in recent years. To address this issue, this paper proposes a channel modeling aided data augmentation method based on a limited number of field channel data. Specifically, the user equipment (UE) extracts the primary stochastic parameters of the field channel data and transmits them to the base station (BS). The BS then updates the typical TR 38.901 model parameters with the extracted parameters. In this way, the updated channel model is used to generate the dataset. This strategy comprehensively considers the dataset collection, model generalization, model monitoring, and so on. Simulations verify that our proposed strategy can significantly improve performance compared to the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Fusion-Based Multi-Task Semantic Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in semantic communication systems empowered by deep learning techniques. It has greatly improved the efficiency of information transmission. Nevertheless, traditional semantic communication models still face challenges, particularly due to their single-task and single-modal orientation. Many of these models are designed for specific tasks, which may result in limitations when applied to multi-task communication systems. Moreover, these models often overlook the correlations among different modal data in multi-modal tasks. It leads to an incomplete understanding of complex information, causing increased communication overhead and diminished performance. To address these problems, we propose a multi-modal fusion-based multi-task semantic communication (MFMSC) framework. In contrast to traditional semantic communication approaches, MFMSC can effectively handle various tasks across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we design a fusion module based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for multi-modal semantic information fusion. By leveraging the powerful semantic understanding capabilities and self-attention mechanism of BERT, we achieve effective fusion of semantic information from different modalities. We compare our model with multiple benchmarks. Simulation results show that MFMSC outperforms these models in terms of both performance and communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems may face a heavy computation burden since the sensory data needs to be further processed. This paper studies a novel system that integrates sensing, communication, and computation, aiming to provide services for different objectives efficiently. This system consists of a multi-antenna multi-functional base station (BS), an edge server, a target, and multiple singleantenna communication users. The BS needs to allocate the available resources to efficiently provide sensing, communication, and computation services. Due to the heavy service burden and limited power budget, the BS can partially offload the tasks to the nearby edge server instead of computing them locally. We consider the estimation of the target response matrix, a general problem in radar sensing, and utilize Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as the corresponding performance metric. To tackle the non-convex optimization problem, we propose both semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based alternating optimization and SDR-based successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms to minimize the CRB of radar sensing while meeting the requirement of communication users and the need for task computing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal rankone solutions of both the alternating and SCA algorithms can be directly obtained via the solver or further constructed even when dealing with multiple functionalities. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can provide higher target estimation performance than state-of-the-art benchmarks while satisfying the communication and computation constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) and terahertz (THz)enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems are gaining significant attention for improving user service delays in future mobile networks. This article introduces a novel multi-UAV-aided MEC system operating at THz frequencies to minimize expected user service delays, including communication and computation latency. We address this challenge by jointly optimizing UAV relay selection, power control, positioning, and user-resource association for task offloading and resource allocation. To tackle the problem's complexities, we decompose it into four subproblems, each solved optimally with our proposed algorithm. An iterative penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm approximates the original problem's solution. Numerical results demonstrate that our PDD-based approach outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of expected user service delay.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Rare Channel Conditions using Bayesian Statistics and Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the probability of rare channel conditions is a central challenge in ultra-reliable wireless communication, where random events, such as deep fades, can cause sudden variations in the channel quality. This paper proposes a sample-efficient framework for predicting the statistics of such events by utilizing spatial dependency between channel measurements acquired from various locations. The proposed framework combines radio maps with non-parametric models and extreme value theory (EVT) to estimate rare-event channel statistics under a Bayesian formulation. The framework can be applied to a wide range of problems in wireless communication and is exemplified by rate selection in ultra-reliable communications. Notably, besides simulated data, the proposed framework is also validated with experimental measurements. The results in both cases show that the Bayesian formulation provides significantly better results in terms of throughput compared to baselines that do not leverage measurements from surrounding locations. It is also observed that the models based on EVT are generally more accurate in predicting rare-event statistics than non-parametric models, especially when only a limited number of channel samples are available. Overall, the proposed methods can significantly reduce the number of measurements required to predict rare channel conditions and guarantee reliability.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of preamble sequences for Galvanic Coupling Intra-Body Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galvanic coupled-intra-body communication (GC-IBC) is an innovative research area contributing to transform personalized medicine by enabling seamless connectivity and communication among implanted devices. To establish a reliable communication link between implanted devices, the preambles play a crucial role by e.g. conveying syncronization information or supporting channel response estimation. The preambles are carefully designed to ensure that they are mutually orthogonal, to minimize self-interference and maximize separability. For that purpose, many permeable sequences are proposed in the literature for 5G and sensor networks. Golay code, Constant Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation (CAZAC) and Zadoff-Chu (Z-Chu) sequences are among the most popular ones. In this work, we performed a comparative analysis of these sequences to determine their suitability for the GC-IBC system. We evaluated the effectiveness of the preamble sequences on the basis of their correlation properties and probability of error.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear MMSE Estimation in One-Bit Quantized Systems under a Gaussian Mixture Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new fundamental results for the mean square error (MSE)-optimal conditional mean estimator (CME) in one-bit quantized systems for a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) distributed signal of interest, possibly corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). We first derive novel closed-form analytic expressions for the Bussgang estimator, the well-known linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator in quantized systems. Afterward, closed-form analytic expressions for the CME in special cases are presented, revealing that the optimal estimator is linear in the one-bit quantized observation, opposite to higher resolution cases. Through a comparison to the recently studied Gaussian case, we establish a novel MSE inequality and show that that the signal of interest is correlated with the auxiliary quantization noise. We extend our analysis to multiple observation scenarios, examining the MSE-optimal transmit sequence and conducting an asymptotic analysis, yielding analytic expressions for the MSE and its limit. These contributions have broad impact for the analysis and design of various signal processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrabody communication (IBC), is a promising technology that can be utilized for data transmission across the human body. In this study, a galvanic coupled (GC)-based IBC channel has been investigated for implantable configuration both theoretically and experimentally in the frequency range of 0 to 2.5 MHz. Theoretical studies were performed by using finite element method (FEM) based simulation software, called Comsol Multiphysics. A cylindrical human arm was modeled with realistic values. Experimental studies were carried out with chicken breast tissue as a substitute for human tissue. The pseudorandom noise (PN) sequences were transmitted to investigate the correlative channel sounder of tissue model. Results showed that the frequency affects signal propagation through the tissue model. Additionally, it is crucial to cancel common-mode noise in the IBC channel to enhance communication quality.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Identifying Anatomical Biomarkers of Early Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the aging population by impairing cognitive and motor functions. Early detection of AD through accessible methodologies like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for developing effective interventions to halt or slow the disease's progression. This study aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of machine learning techniques for selecting MRI-based biomarkers and classifying individuals into healthy controls (HC) and unstable controls (uHC) who later show mild cognitive impairment within five years. The research utilizes MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroinformatics Initiative (ADNI) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), focusing on both HC and uHC participants. The study addresses the challenges of imbalanced data by testing classification methods on balanced and unbalanced datasets, and harmonizes data using polynomial regression to mitigate nuisance variables like age, gender, and intracranial volume. Results indicate that Gaussian Naive Bayes and RusBoost classifiers shows an optimal performance, achieving accuracies of up to 76.46% and 72.48% respectively on the ADNI dataset. For the OASIS-3 dataset, Kernel Naive Bayes and RusBoost yield accuracies ranging from 64.66% to 75.71%, improving further in age-matched datasets. Brain regions like the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex are identified as significantly impacted during early cognitive decline. Despite limitations such as small sample sizes, the study's harmonization approach enhances the robustness of biomarker selection, suggesting the potential of this semi-automatic machine learning pipeline for early AD detection using MRI.</description>

Abstract: The $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is a cornerstone for several signal processing applications. Many of these applications operate in real-time, making the computational complexity of the DFT a critical performance indicator to be optimized. Unfortunately, whether the $\mathcal{O}(N\log_2 N)$ time complexity of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be outperformed remains an unresolved question in the theory of computation. However, in many applications of the DFT -- such as compressive sensing, image processing, and wideband spectral analysis -- only a small fraction of the output signal needs to be computed because the signal is sparse. This motivates the development of algorithms that compute specific DFT coefficients more efficiently than the FFT algorithm. In this article, we show that the number of points of some DFT coefficients can be dramatically reduced by means of elementary mathematical properties. We present an algorithm that compacts the square index coefficients (SICs) of DFT (i.e., $X_{k\sqrt{N}}$, $k=0,1,\cdots, \sqrt{N}-1$, for a square number $N$) from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$ points at the expense of $N-1$ complex sums and no multiplication. Based on this, any regular DFT algorithm can be straightforwardly applied to compute the SICs with a reduced number of complex multiplications. If $N$ is a power of two, one can combine our algorithm with the FFT to calculate all SICs in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}\log_2\sqrt{N})$ time complexity.</description>

      <title>Saturation of gas concentration signal of the laser gas sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays it is possible to determine the type of gas with sufficient accuracy when its concentration is less than {10}^{-6} (in units of ppm) fractions using spectroscopic methods (optical, radio engineering, acoustic). Along with this, the value of permissible concentrations of explosive, toxic, harmful to technology and ecology gases is practically important. Known physical experimental studies indicate only a linear dependence of the response of a laser gas sensor at ppm\gtrsim{10}^3. The research methods for ppm\lesssim{10}^3 are based on the processes of combustion, microexplosion, structural and phase transformations and are not always applicable in real practical conditions. The work is devoted to the analysis of experimentally obtained fluctuations caused by a laser beam in a gas in a photodiode (signal receiver) due to its influence not only at the atomic level, but also on the scale of clusters of nanoparticle molecules. The gas concentration is estimated by the fluctuation-dissipation ratio. It is shown that the signal correlator is saturated to a constant value when the quantum (laser photon energy) and thermal (nanoparticle temperature) factors are comparable with an increase in the concentration of the target gas. The critical values of the saturation concentration are determined by the equality of these two factors.</description>

      <title>Active-RIS-Aided Covert Communications in NOMA-Inspired ISAC Wireless Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) facilitates spectrum sharing for radar sensing and NOMA communications, whereas facing privacy and security challenges due to open wireless propagation. In this paper, active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to aid covert communications in NOMA-inspired ISAC wireless system with the aim of maximizing the covert rate. Specifically, a dual-function base-station (BS) transmits the superposition signal to sense multiple targets, while achieving covert and reliable communications for a pair of NOMA covert and public users, respectively, in the presence of a warden. Two superposition transmission schemes, namely, the transmissions with dedicated sensing signal (w-DSS) and without dedicated sensing signal (w/o-DSS), are respectively considered in the formulations of the joint transmission and reflection beamforming optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that active-RIS-aided NOMA-ISAC system outperforms the passive-RIS-aided and without-RIS counterparts in terms of covert rate and trade-off between covert communication and sensing performance metrics. Finally, the w/o-DSS scheme, which omits the dedicated sensing signal, achieves a higher covert rate than the w-DSS scheme by allocating more transmit power for the covert transmissions, while preserving a comparable multi-target sensing performance.</description>

      <title>CaFNet: A Confidence-Driven Framework for Radar Camera Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation is critical in autonomous driving for interpreting 3D scenes accurately. Recently, radar-camera depth estimation has become of sufficient interest due to the robustness and low-cost properties of radar. Thus, this paper introduces a two-stage, end-to-end trainable Confidence-aware Fusion Net (CaFNet) for dense depth estimation, combining RGB imagery with sparse and noisy radar point cloud data. The first stage addresses radar-specific challenges, such as ambiguous elevation and noisy measurements, by predicting a radar confidence map and a preliminary coarse depth map. A novel approach is presented for generating the ground truth for the confidence map, which involves associating each radar point with its corresponding object to identify potential projection surfaces. These maps, together with the initial radar input, are processed by a second encoder. For the final depth estimation, we innovate a confidence-aware gated fusion mechanism to integrate radar and image features effectively, thereby enhancing the reliability of the depth map by filtering out radar noise. Our methodology, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates superior performance, improving upon the current leading model by 3.2% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 2.7% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Computational Surfaces for MEC-Assisted Autonomous Driving Networks: Design Optimization and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates autonomous driving safety improvement via task offloading from cellular vehicles (CVs) to a multi-access edge computing (MEC) server using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. Considering that the latter links can be reused by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to improve spectrum utilization, the receiver of the V2I link may suffer from severe interference that can cause outages during the task offloading. To tackle this issue, we propose the deployment of a reconfigurable intelligent computational surface (RICS) whose computationally capable metamaterials are leveraged to jointly enable V2I reflective links as well as to implement interference cancellation at the V2V links. We devise a joint optimization formulation for the task offloading ratio between the CVs and the MEC server, the spectrum sharing strategy between V2V and V2I communications, as well as the RICS reflection and refraction matrices to maximize an autonomous driving safety task. Due to the non-convexity of the problem and the coupling among its free variables, we transform it into a more tractable equivalent form, which is then decomposed into three sub-problems solved via an alternate approximation method. Our simulation results showcase that the proposed RICS-assisted offloading framework significantly improves the safety of the considered autonomous driving network, yielding a nearly 34\% improvement in the safety coefficient of the CVs. In addition, it is demonstrated that the V2V data rate can be improved by around 60\% indicating that the RICS-induced adjustment of the signals can effectively mitigate interference at the V2V link.</description>

      <title>Task-oriented Over-the-air Computation for Edge-device Co-inference with Balanced Classification Accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-device co-inference, which concerns the cooperation between edge devices and an edge server for completing inference tasks over wireless networks, has been a promising technique for enabling various kinds of intelligent services at the network edge, e.g., auto-driving. In this paradigm, the concerned design objective of the network shifts from the traditional communication throughput to the effective and efficient execution of the inference task underpinned by the network, measured by, e.g., the inference accuracy and latency. In this paper, a task-oriented over-the-air computation scheme is proposed for a multidevice artificial intelligence system. Particularly, a novel tractable inference accuracy metric is proposed for classification tasks, which is called minimum pair-wise discriminant gain. Unlike prior work measuring the average of all class pairs in feature space, it measures the minimum distance of all class pairs. By maximizing the minimum pair-wise discriminant gain instead of its average counterpart, any pair of classes can be better separated in the feature space, and thus leading to a balanced and improved inference accuracy for all classes. Besides, this paper jointly optimizes the minimum discriminant gain of all feature elements instead of separately maximizing that of each element in the existing designs. As a result, the transmit power can be adaptively allocated to the feature elements according to their different contributions to the inference accuracy, opening an extra degree of freedom to improve inference performance. Extensive experiments are conducted using a concrete use case of human motion recognition to verify the superiority of the proposed design over the benchmarking scheme.</description>

Abstract: Tool wear conditions impact the final quality of the workpiece. In this study, we propose a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network that incorporates cutting conditions as extra model inputs, aiming to improve tool wear estimation accuracy and fulfill industrial demands for zero-shot transferability. Through a series of milling experiments under various cutting parameters, we evaluate the model's performance in terms of tool wear estimation accuracy and its transferability to new fixed or variable cutting parameters. The results consistently highlight our approach's advantage over conventional models that omit cutting conditions, maintaining superior performance irrespective of the stability of the wear development or the limitation of the training dataset. This finding underscores its potential applicability in industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensing Inspired User Acquisition for Downlink Integrated Sensing and Communication Transmissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates radar-assisted user acquisition for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals. Specifically, we formulate a concise mathematical model for the user acquisition problem, where each user is characterized by its delay and beamspace response. Therefore, we propose a two-stage method for user acquisition, where the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is adopted for delay estimation, and then a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is applied for estimating the user response in the beamspace. Furthermore, we also provide a comprehensive performance analysis of the considered problem based on the pair-wise error probability (PEP). Particularly, we show that the rank and the geometric mean of non-zero eigenvalues of the squared beamspace difference matrix determines the user acquisition performance. More importantly, we reveal that simultaneously probing multiple beams outperforms concentrating power on a specific beam direction in each time slot under the power constraint, when only limited OFDM symbols are transmitted. Our numerical results confirm our conclusions and also demonstrate a promising acquisition performance of the proposed two-stage method.</description>

Abstract: The growing demand for optimal and low-power energy consumption paradigms for IOT devices has garnered significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and intelligibility. In this article, an AI hardware energy-efficient framework to achieve optimal energy savings in heterogeneous computing through appropriate power consumption management is proposed. The deep reinforcement learning framework is employed, utilising the Actor-Critic architecture to provide a simple and precise method for power saving. The results of the study demonstrate the proposed approach's suitability for different hardware configurations, achieving notable energy consumption control while adhering to strict performance requirements. The evaluation of the proposed power-saving framework shows that it is more stable, and has achieved more than 34.6% efficiency improvement, outperforming other methods by more than 16%.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling in RIS-Aided Communication: Model Training and Experimental Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual coupling is increasingly important in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communications, particularly when RIS elements are densely integrated in applications such as holographic communications. This paper experimentally investigates the mutual coupling effect among RIS elements using a mutual coupling-aware communication model based on scattering matrices. Utilizing a fabricated 1-bit quasi-passive RIS prototype operating in the mmWave band, we propose a practical model training approach based on a single 3D full-wave simulation of the RIS radiation pattern, which enables the estimation of the scattering matrix among RIS unit cells. The formulated estimation problem is rigorously convex with a limited number of unknowns un-scaling with RIS size. The trained model is validated through both full-wave simulations and experimental measurements on the fabricated RIS prototype. Compared to the conventional communication model that does not account for mutual coupling in RIS, the mutual coupling-aware model incorporating trained scattering parameters demonstrates improved prediction accuracy. Benchmarked against the full-wave simulated RIS radiation pattern, the trained model can reduce prediction error by up to approximately 10.7%. Meanwhile, the S-parameter between the Tx and Rx antennas is measured, validating that the trained model exhibits closer alignment with the experimental measurements. These results affirm the accuracy of the adopted model and the effectiveness of the proposed model training method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inversion of GPR waveforms for sub-surface material characterization: an uncertainty-aware retrieval of soil moisture and overlaying biomass properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of sub-surface properties such as moisture content and depth of soil and vegetation layers is crucial for applications spanning sub-surface condition monitoring, precision agriculture, and effective wildfire risk assessment. Soil in nature is often covered by overlaying vegetation and surface organic material, making its characterization challenging. In addition, the estimation of the properties of the overlaying layer is crucial for applications like wildfire risk assessment. This study thus proposes a Bayesian model-updating-based approach for ground penetrating radar (GPR) waveform inversion to predict moisture contents and depths of soil and overlaying material layer. Due to its high correlation with moisture contents, the dielectric permittivity of both layers were predicted with the proposed method, along with other parameters, including depth and electrical conductivity of layers. The proposed Bayesian model updating approach yields probabilistic estimates of these parameters that can provide information about the confidence and uncertainty related to the estimates. The methodology was evaluated for a diverse range of experimental data collected through laboratory and field investigations. Laboratory investigations included variations in soil moisture values, depth of the overlaying surface layer, and coarseness of its material. The field investigation included measurement of field soil moisture for sixteen days. The results demonstrated predictions consistent with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements and conventional gravimetric tests. The depth of the surface layer could also be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The proposed method provides a promising approach for uncertainty-aware sub-surface parameter estimation that can enable decision-making for risk assessment across a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Stimulus-Informed Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis for Group Analysis of Neural Responses to Natural Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various new brain-computer interface technologies or neuroscience applications require decoding stimulus-following neural responses to natural stimuli such as speech and video from, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this context, generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) is often used as a group analysis technique, which allows the extraction of correlated signal components from the neural activity of multiple subjects attending to the same stimulus. GCCA can be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimulus-following neural responses relative to all other irrelevant (non-)neural activity, or to quantify the correlated neural activity across multiple subjects in a group-wise coherence metric. However, the traditional GCCA technique is stimulus-unaware: no information about the stimulus is used to estimate the correlated components from the neural data of several subjects. Therefore, the GCCA technique might fail to extract relevant correlated signal components in practical situations where the amount of information is limited, for example, because of a limited amount of training data or group size. This motivates a new stimulus-informed GCCA (SI-GCCA) framework that allows taking the stimulus into account to extract the correlated components. We show that SI-GCCA outperforms GCCA in various practical settings, for both auditory and visual stimuli. Moreover, we showcase how SI-GCCA can be used to steer the estimation of the components towards the stimulus. As such, SI-GCCA substantially improves upon GCCA for various purposes, ranging from preprocessing to quantifying attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a C-band shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) resonator with high electromechanical coupling (kt2) of 22% and a quality factor (Q) of 565 based on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) on silicon carbide (SiC) platform, featuring an excellent figure-of-merit (FoM = kt2*Q ) of 124 at 6.5 GHz, the highest FoM reported in this frequency range. The resonator frequency upscaling is achieved through wavelength ($\lambda$) reduction and the use of thin aluminum (Al) electrodes. The LN/SiC waveguide and synchronous resonator design collectively enable effective acoustic energy confinement for a high FoM, even when the normalized thickness of LN approaches a scale of 0.5$\lambda$ to 1$\lambda$. To perform a comprehensive study, we also designed and fabricated five additional resonators, expending the $\lambda$ studied ranging from 480 to 800 nm, in the same 500 nm-thick transferred Y-cut thin-film LN on SiC. The fabricated SH-SAW resonators, operating from 5 to 8 GHz, experimentally demonstrate a kt2 from 20.3% to 22.9% and a Q from 350 to 575, thereby covering the entire C-band with excellent performance.</description>

Abstract: Interplanetary links (IPL) serve as crucial enablers for space exploration, facilitating secure and adaptable space missions. An integrated IPL with inter-satellite communication (IP-ISL) establishes a unified deep space network, expanding coverage and reducing atmospheric losses. The challenges, including irregularities in charged density, hardware impairments, and hidden celestial body brightness are analyzed with a reflectarray-based IP-ISL between Earth and Moon orbiters. It is observed that $10^{-8}$ order severe hardware impairments with intense solar plasma density drops an ideal system's spectral efficiency (SE) from $\sim\!38~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ down to $0~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$. An ideal full angle of arrival fluctuation recovery with full steering range achieves $\sim\!20~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain and a limited beamsteering with a numerical reflectarray design achieves at least $\sim\!1~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain in severe hardware impairment cases.</description>

      <title>SRViT: Vision Transformers for Estimating Radar Reflectivity from Satellite Observations at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network to generate high-resolution (3km) synthetic radar reflectivity fields at scale from geostationary satellite imagery. This work aims to enhance short-term convective-scale forecasts of high-impact weather events and aid in data assimilation for numerical weather prediction over the United States. Compared to convolutional approaches, which have limited receptive fields, our results show improved sharpness and higher accuracy across various composite reflectivity thresholds. Additional case studies over specific atmospheric phenomena support our quantitative findings, while a novel attribution method is introduced to guide domain experts in understanding model outputs.</description>

      <title>V2X Sidelink Positioning in FR1: From Ray-Tracing and Channel Estimation to Bayesian Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sidelink positioning research predominantly focuses on the snapshot positioning problem, often within the mmWave band. Only a limited number of studies have delved into vehicle-to-anything (V2X) tracking within sub-6 GHz bands. In this paper, we investigate the V2X sidelink tracking challenges over sub-6 GHz frequencies. We propose a Kalman-filter-based tracking approach that leverages the estimated error covariance lower bounds (EECLBs) as measurement covariance, alongside a gating method to augment tracking performance. Through simulations employing ray-tracing data and super-resolution channel parameter estimation, we validate the feasibility of sidelink tracking using our proposed tracking filter with two novel EECLBs. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the gating method in identifying line-of-sight paths and enhancing tracking performance.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Millimeter Wave Imaging Based on FMCW Radar Systems at W-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unique $\text {2D}$ high resolution, compact, low-cost, low-weight, and highly accurate millimeter wave imagery system capable of operating in all weather conditions. We describe millimeter wave imaging process in detail and present several novel signal processing methods with their applications. To create the array, we utilize the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) concept. The imagery system presented in this work, can strongly compete with Lidar systems as the resolution limit is at the same level. Furthermore, in contrast to the Lidar systems, our imagery system can operate in heavy rain and dense fog and produce high quality images.
  We use our custom-made Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar operating at W-band with $\text {33 GHz}$ bandwidth for data collection and present the results.</description>

      <title>Robust Low-Cost Drone Detection and Classification in Low SNR Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has raised significant safety concerns due to their potential misuse in activities such as espionage, smuggling, and infrastructure disruption. This paper addresses the critical need for effective drone detection and classification systems that operate independently of UAV cooperation. We evaluate various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for their ability to detect and classify drones using spectrogram data derived from consecutive Fourier transforms of signal components. The focus is on model robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, which is critical for real-world applications. A comprehensive dataset is provided to support future model development. In addition, we demonstrate a low-cost drone detection system using a standard computer, software-defined radio (SDR) and antenna, validated through real-world field testing. On our development dataset, all models consistently achieved an average balanced classification accuracy of &gt;= 85% at SNR &gt; -12dB. In the field test, these models achieved an average balance accuracy of &gt; 80%, depending on transmitter distance and antenna direction. Our contributions include: a publicly available dataset for model development, a comparative analysis of CNN for drone detection under low SNR conditions, and the deployment and field evaluation of a practical, low-cost detection system.</description>

      <title>Deformable Radar Polygon: A Lightweight and Predictable Occupancy Representation for Short-range Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the drivable area in a scene is crucial for ensuring a vehicle avoids obstacles and facilitates safe autonomous driving. In this paper, we concentrate on detecting the instantaneous free space surrounding the ego vehicle, targeting short-range automotive applications. We introduce a novel polygon-based occupancy representation, where the interior signifies free space, and the exterior represents undrivable areas for the ego-vehicle. The radar polygon consists of vertices selected from point cloud measurements provided by radars, with each vertex incorporating Doppler velocity information from automotive radars. This information indicates the movement of the vertex along the radial direction. This characteristic allows for the prediction of the shape of future radar polygons, leading to its designation as a ``deformable radar polygon". We propose two approaches to leverage noisy radar measurements for producing accurate and smooth radar polygons. The first approach is a basic radar polygon formation algorithm, which independently selects polygon vertices for each frame, using SNR-based evidence for vertex fitness verification. The second approach is the radar polygon update algorithm, which employs a probabilistic and tracking-based mechanism to update the radar polygon over time, further enhancing accuracy and smoothness. To accommodate the unique radar polygon format, we also designed a collision detection method for short-range applications. Through extensive experiments and analysis on both a self-collected dataset and the open-source RadarScenes dataset, we demonstrate that our radar polygon algorithms achieve significantly higher IoU-gt and IoU-smooth values compared to other occupancy detection baselines, highlighting their accuracy and smoothness.</description>

      <title>Beamfocusing Optimization for Near-Field Wideband Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16861v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A near-field wideband communication system is investigated in which a base station (BS) employs an extra-large scale antenna array (ELAA) to serve multiple users in its near-field region. To facilitate near-field multi-user beamforming and mitigate the spatial wideband effect, the BS employs a hybrid beamforming architecture based on true-time delayers (TTDs). In addition to the conventional fully-connected TTD-based hybrid beamforming architecture, a new sub-connected architecture is proposed to improve energy efficiency and reduce hardware requirements. Two wideband beamforming optimization approaches are proposed to maximize spectral efficiency for both architectures. 1) Fully-digital approximation (FDA) approach: In this method, the TTD-based hybrid beamformer is optimized by the block-coordinate descent and penalty method to approximate the optimal digital beamformer. This approach ensures convergence to the stationary point of the spectral efficiency maximization problem. 2) Heuristic two-stage (HTS) approach: In this approach, the analog and digital beamformers are designed in two stages. In particular, two low-complexity methods are proposed to design the high-dimensional analog beamformers based on approximate and exact line-of-sight channels, respectively. Subsequently, the low-dimensional digital beamformer is optimized based on the low-dimensional equivalent channels, resulting in reduced computational complexity and channel estimation complexity. Our numerical results show that 1) the proposed approach effectively eliminates the spatial wideband effect, and 2) the proposed sub-connected architecture is more energy efficient and has fewer hardware constraints on the TTD and system bandwidth compared to the fully-connected architecture.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity eigenvector prediction-based precoding matrix prediction in massive MIMO with mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the precoding matrix is often obtained from the eigenvectors of channel matrices and is challenging to update in time due to finite computation resources at the base station, especially in mobile scenarios. In order to reduce the precoding complexity while enhancing the spectral efficiency (SE), a novel precoding matrix prediction method based on the eigenvector prediction (EGVP) is proposed. The basic idea is to decompose the periodic uplink channel eigenvector samples into a linear combination of the channel state information (CSI) and channel weights. We further prove that the channel weights can be interpolated by an exponential model corresponding to the Doppler characteristics of the CSI. A fast matrix pencil prediction (FMPP) method is also devised to predict the CSI. We also prove that our scheme achieves asymptotically error-free precoder prediction with a distinct complexity advantage. Simulation results show that under the perfect non-delayed CSI, the proposed EGVP method reduces floating point operations by 80\% without losing SE performance compared to the traditional full-time precoding scheme. In more realistic cases with CSI delays, the proposed EGVP-FMPP scheme has clear SE performance gains compared to the precoding scheme widely used in current communication systems.</description>

      <title>Is one brick enough to break the wall of spoken dialogue state tracking?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems, correctly updating the system's understanding of the user's requests (\textit{a.k.a} dialogue state tracking) is key to a smooth interaction. Traditionally, TOD systems perform this update in three steps: transcription of the user's utterance, semantic extraction of the key concepts, and contextualization with the previously identified concepts. Such cascade approaches suffer from cascading errors and separate optimization. End-to-End approaches have been proven helpful up to the turn-level semantic extraction step. This paper goes one step further and provides (1) a novel approach for completely neural spoken DST, (2) an in depth comparison with a state of the art cascade approach and (3) avenues towards better context propagation. Our study highlights that jointly-optimized approaches are also competitive for contextually dependent tasks, such as Dialogue State Tracking (DST), especially in audio native settings. Context propagation in DST systems could benefit from training procedures accounting for the previous' context inherent uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Time Series Diffusion Method: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Vibration Signal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful data generation capabilities in various research fields such as image generation. However, in the field of vibration signal generation, the criteria for evaluating the quality of the generated signal are different from that of image generation and there is a fundamental difference between them. At present, there is no research on the ability of diffusion model to generate vibration signal. In this paper, a Time Series Diffusion Method (TSDM) is proposed for vibration signal generation, leveraging the foundational principles of diffusion models. The TSDM uses an improved U-net architecture with attention block, ResBlock and TimeEmbedding to effectively segment and extract features from one-dimensional time series data. It operates based on forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes for time-series generation. Experimental validation is conducted using single-frequency, multi-frequency datasets, and bearing fault datasets. The results show that TSDM can accurately generate the single-frequency and multi-frequency features in the time series and retain the basic frequency features for the diffusion generation results of the bearing fault series. It is also found that the original DDPM could not generate high quality vibration signals, but the improved U-net in TSDM, which applied the combination of attention block and ResBlock, could effectively improve the quality of vibration signal generation. Finally, TSDM is applied to the small sample fault diagnosis of three public bearing fault datasets, and the results show that the accuracy of small sample fault diagnosis of the three datasets is improved by 32.380%, 18.355% and 9.298% at most, respectively.</description>

      <title>SENS3: Multisensory Database of Finger-Surface Interactions and Corresponding Sensations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for natural interactions with technology underscores the importance of achieving realistic touch sensations in digital environments. Realizing this goal highly depends on comprehensive databases of finger-surface interactions, which need further development. Here, we present SENS3 -- www.sens3.net -- an extensive open-access repository of multisensory data acquired from fifty surfaces when two participants explored them with their fingertips through static contact, pressing, tapping, and sliding. SENS3 encompasses high-fidelity visual, audio, and haptic information recorded during these interactions, including videos, sounds, contact forces, torques, positions, accelerations, skin temperature, heat flux, and surface photographs. Additionally, it incorporates thirteen participants' psychophysical sensation ratings (rough-smooth, flat-bumpy, sticky-slippery, hot-cold, regular-irregular, fine-coarse, hard-soft, and wet-dry) while exploring these surfaces freely. Designed with an open-ended framework, SENS3 has the potential to be expanded with additional textures and participants. We anticipate that SENS3 will be valuable for advancing multisensory texture rendering, user experience development, and touch sensing in robotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. In this regime, schemes based on sparse superposition coding can achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. However, these schemes are feasible only for small values of user payload. This paper investigates efficient schemes for larger user payloads, focusing on coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize its tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results show that the decoder achieves state-of-the-art performance at finite lengths, with a coded CDMA scheme defined using LDPC codes and a spatially coupled matrix of signature sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning field of on-device AI communication, where devices exchange information directly through embedded foundation models, such as language models (LMs), requires robust, efficient, and generalizable communication frameworks. However, integrating these frameworks with existing wireless systems and effectively managing noise and bit errors pose significant challenges. In this work, we introduce a practical ondevice AI communication framework, integrated with physical layer (PHY) communication functions, demonstrated through its performance on a link-level simulator. Our framework incorporates end-to-end training with channel noise to enhance resilience, incorporates vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) for efficient and robust communication, and utilizes pre-trained encoder-decoder transformers for improved generalization capabilities. Simulations, across various communication scenarios, reveal that our framework achieves a 50% reduction in transmission size while demonstrating substantial generalization ability and noise robustness under standardized 3GPP channel models.</description>

      <title>23.8-GHz Acoustic Filter in Periodically Poled Piezoelectric Film Lithium Niobate With 1.52-dB IL and 19.4% FBW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first piezoelectric acoustic filter in periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) lithium niobate (LiNbO3) at 23.8 GHz with low insertion loss (IL) of 1.52 dB and 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 19.4%. The filter features a compact footprint of 0.64 mm2. The third-order ladder filter is implemented with electrically coupled resonators in 150 nm bi-layer P3F 128 rotated Y-cut LiNbO3 thin film, operating in second-order symmetric (S2) Lamb mode. The record-breaking performance is enabled by the P3F LiNbO3 platform, where piezoelectric thin films of alternating orientations are transferred subsequently, facilitating efficient higher-order Lamb mode operation with simultaneously high quality factor (Q) and coupling coefficient (k2) at millimeter-wave (mmWave). Also, the multi-layer P3F stack promises smaller footprints and better nonlinearity than single-layer counterparts, thanks to the higher capacitance density and lower thermal resistance. Upon further development, the reported P3F LiNbO3 platform is promising for compact filters at mmWave.</description>

      <title>Spatial features of CO2 for occupancy detection in a naturally ventilated school building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate occupancy information helps to improve building energy efficiency and occupant comfort. Occupancy detection methods based on CO2 sensors have received attention due to their low cost and low intrusiveness. In naturally ventilated buildings, the accuracy of CO2-based occupancy detection is generally low in related studies due to the complex ventilation behavior and the difficulty in measuring the actual air exchange through windows. In this study, we present two novel features for occupancy detection based on the spatial distribution of the CO2 concentration. After a quantitative analysis with Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier, it was found that the accuracy of occupancy state detection in naturally ventilated rooms could be improved by up to 14.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, reaching 83.2 % (F1 score 0.84) without any ventilation information. With ventilation information, the accuracy reached 87.6 % (F1 score 0.89). The performance of occupancy quantity detection was significantly improved by up to 25.3 percentage points versus baseline, reaching 56 %, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.44 occupants, using only CO2-related features. Additional ventilation information further enhanced the performance to 61.8 % (RMSE 9.02 occupants). By incorporating spatial features, the model using only CO2-related features revealed similar performance as the model containing additional ventilation information, resulting in a better low-cost occupancy detection method for naturally ventilated buildings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To accommodate new applications such as extended reality, fully autonomous vehicular networks and the metaverse, next generation wireless networks are going to be subject to much more stringent performance requirements than the fifth-generation (5G) in terms of data rates, reliability, latency, and connectivity. It is thus necessary to develop next generation advanced transceiver (NGAT) technologies for efficient signal transmission and reception. In this tutorial, we explore the evolution of NGAT from three different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide an overview of new-field NGAT technology, which shifts from conventional far-field channel models to new near-field channel models. Then, three new-form NGAT technologies and their design challenges are presented, including reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, flexible antennas, and holographic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Subsequently, we discuss recent advances in semantic-aware NGAT technologies, which can utilize new metrics for advanced transceiver designs. Finally, we point out other promising transceiver technologies for future research.</description>
