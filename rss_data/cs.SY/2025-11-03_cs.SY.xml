      <title>Cooperative Integrated Estimation-Guidance for Simultaneous Interception of Moving Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated estimation-guidance framework for simultaneous interception of a non-maneuvering target using a team of unmanned autonomous vehicles, assuming only a subset of vehicles are equipped with dedicated sensors to measure the target's states. Unlike earlier approaches that focus solely on either estimation or guidance design, the proposed framework unifies both within a cooperative architecture. To circumvent the limitation posed by heterogeneity in target observability, sensorless vehicles estimate the target's state by leveraging information exchanged with neighboring agents over a directed communication topology through a prescribed-time observer. The proposed approach employs true proportional navigation guidance (TPNG), which uses an exact time-to-go formulation and is applicable across a wide spectrum of target motions. Furthermore, prescribed-time observer and controller are employed to achieve convergence to true target's state and consensus in time-to-go within set predefined times, respectively. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under various engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ferrohydrodynamic Microfluidics for Bioparticle Separation and Single-Cell Phenotyping: Principles, Applications, and Emerging Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics relies on magnetic field gradients to manipulate diamagnetic particles in ferrofluid-filled microenvironments. It has emerged as a promising tool for label-free manipulation of bioparticles, including their separation and phenotyping. This perspective reviews recent progress in the development and applications of ferrofluid-based microfluidic platforms for multiscale bioparticle separation, ranging from micron-scale cells to submicron extracellular vesicles. We highlight the fundamental physical principles for ferrohydrodynamic manipulation, including the dominant magnetic buoyancy force resulting from the interaction of ferrofluids and particles. We then describe how these principles enable high-resolution size-based bioparticle separation, subcellular bioparticle enrichment, and phenotypic screening based on physical traits. We also discuss key challenges in ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics from the aspects of ferrofluid biocompatibility, system throughput, and nanoparticle depletion. Finally, we outline future research directions involving machine learning, 3D printing, and multiplexed detection. These insights chart a path for advancing ferrofluid-based technologies in precision biomedicine, diagnostics, and cellular engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-level Dynamics and System-Level Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) technology is widely regarded as a promising solution for future power systems dominated by power electronics. However, a precise method for quantifying GFM converter behavior and a universally accepted GFM definition remain elusive. Moreover, the impact of GFM on system stability is not precisely quantified, creating a significant disconnect between device and system levels. To address these gaps from a small-signal perspective, at the device level, we introduce a novel metric, the Forming Index (FI) to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage fluctuations. Rather than enumerating various control architectures, the FI provides a metric for the converter's GFM ability by quantifying its sensitivity to grid variations. At the system level, we propose a new quantitative measure of system strength that captures the multi-bus voltage stiffness, which quantifies the voltage and phase angle responses of multiple buses to current or power disturbances. We further extend this concept to grid strength and bus strength to identify weak areas within the system. Finally, we bridge the device and system levels by formally proving that GFM converters enhance system strength. Our proposed framework provides a unified benchmark for GFM converter design, optimal placement, and system stability assessment.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control for a Physics-Informed Model of a Thermal Energy Distribution System: Qualitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated energy systems (IES) are complex heterogeneous architectures that typically encompass power sources, hydrogen electrolyzers, energy storage, and heat exchangers. This integration is achieved through operating control strategy optimization. However, the lack of physical understanding as to how these systems evolve over time introduces uncertainties that hinder reliable application thereof. Techniques that can accommodate such uncertainties are fundamental for ensuring proper operation of these systems. Unfortunately, no unifying methodology exists for accommodating uncertainties in this regard. That being said, adaptive control (AC) is a discipline that may allow for accommodating such uncertainties in real-time. In the present work, we derive an AC formulation for linear systems in which all states are observable and apply it to the control of a glycol heat exchanger (GHX) in an IES. Based on prior research in which we quantified the uncertainties of the GHXs system dynamics, we introduced an error of 50% on four terms of the nominal model. In the case where a linear quadratic regulator is used as the nominal control for the reference system, we found that employing AC can reduce the mean absolute error and integral time absolute error by a factor of 30%-75%. This reduction is achieved with minimal computing overhead and control infrastructure, thus underscoring the strength of AC. However, the control effort induced is significant, therefore warranting further study in order to estimate its impact on a physical system. To address further challenges, including partially observable and non-linear dynamics, enhancements of the linear formulation are currently being developed.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Parameter Conditions for Stability and Coupling in GFM-GFL Converter Hybrid Systems from a Small-Signal Synchronous Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of renewable energy sources, power systems are gradually evolving into a system comprising both grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) converters. However, the dynamic interaction between the two types of converters, especially low-inertia GFM converters and GFL converters, remains unclear due to the substantial differences in their synchronization mechanisms. To address this gap, this paper develops a small-signal synchronous stability model for power systems containing GFM and GFL converters, which considers network line dynamics. Based on subspace perturbation theory, we reveal that GFM and GFL subsystems can be effectively decoupled when GFL converters operate near unity power factor or when GFM converters possess sufficiently large inertia or damping, and provide lower bound of control parameters ensuring decoupling. Under the decoupling condition, we propose decentralized and analytical parameter-based stability criteria which have clear physical interpretations: the positive damping of converters compensates for the negative damping of the network. In the case of coupling, we also propose decentralized stability criteria based on the small phase theorem. The effectiveness of the theoretical analysis is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</description>

      <title>Dispatchable Current Source Virtual Oscillator Control Achieving Global Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel dispatchable current source virtual oscillator control (dCVOC) scheme for grid-following (GFL) converters, which exhibits duality with dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC) in two ways: a) the current frequency is generated through reactive power control, similar to a PLL ; b) the current magnitude reference is generated through active power control. We formally prove that our proposed control always admits a steady-state equilibrium and ensures global stability under reasonable conditions on grid and converter parameters, even when considering LVRT and current saturation constraints. Our approach avoids low-voltage transients and weak grid instability, which is not the case for conventional GFL control. The effectiveness of our proposed control is verified through high-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations.</description>

      <title>Solving Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control Problems using the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed machine learning approach for synthesizing optimal feedback control policy for infinite-horizon optimal control problems by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation(PDE). The optimal control policy is derived analytically for affine dynamical systems with separable and strictly convex control costs, expressed as a function of the gradient of the value function. The resulting HJB-PDE is then solved by approximating the value function using the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC) - a hybrid approach that combines the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) with the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. This approach ensures analytical satisfaction of boundary conditions and significantly reduces training cost compared to traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We benchmark the method on linear and non-linear systems with known analytical solutions as well as demonstrate its effectiveness on control tasks such as spacecraft optimal de-tumbling control.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Preference Elicitation in Local Energy Markets: Combinatorial Clock Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) proliferate, future power system will need new market platforms enabling prosumers to trade various electricity and grid-support products. However, prosumers often exhibit complex, product interdependent preferences and face limited cognitive and computational resources, hindering engagement with complex market structures and bid formats. We address this challenge by introducing a multi-product market that allows prosumers to express complex preferences through an intuitive format, by fusing combinatorial clock exchange and machine learning (ML) techniques. The iterative mechanism only requires prosumers to report their preferred package of products at posted prices, eliminating the need for forecasting product prices or adhering to complex bid formats, while the ML-aided price discovery speeds up convergence. The linear pricing rule further enhances transparency and interpretability. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate convergence to clearing prices in approximately 15 clock iterations.</description>

      <title>A Switching Strategy for Event-Trigger Control of Spacecraft Rendezvous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of a state-feedback control law for spacecraft rendezvous, formulated using the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations. The proposed method introduces an impulsive control strategy to regulate thruster operations. Specifically, a state-dependent switching framework is developed to determine both the control input magnitudes and the precise state conditions that trigger thruster activation. The nonlinear control law is derived using principles from automatic control theory, particularly Lyapunov stability analysis and the Linear Matrix Inequality framework. The resulting closed-loop system is proven to be stable, while simultaneously minimizing the total number of actuation events. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical case study, which includes a comparative analysis with a standard Model Predictive Control scheme, highlighting the advantages and trade-offs of the developed control structure.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Stochastic Modeling of Consumer Energy Resource Aggregators in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregators of consumer energy resources (CERs) like rooftop solar and battery energy storage (BES) face challenges due to their inherent uncertainties. A sensible approach is to use stochastic optimization to handle such uncertainties, which can lead to infeasible problems or loss in revenues if not chosen appropriately. This paper presents three efficient two-stage stochastic optimization methods: risk-neutral, robust, and chance-constrained, to address the impact of CER uncertainties for aggregators who participate in energy and regulation services markets in the Australian National Electricity Market. Furthermore, these methods utilize the flexibility of BES, considering precise state-of-charge dynamics and complementarity constraints, aiming for scalable performance while managing uncertainty. The problems are formed as two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs, with relaxations adopted for large scenario sets. The solution approach employs scenario-based methodologies and affine recourse policies to obtain tractable reformulations. These methods are evaluated across use cases reflecting diverse operational and market settings, uncertainty characteristics, and decision-making preferences, demonstrating their ability to mitigate uncertainty, enhance profitability, and provide context-aware guidance for aggregators in choosing the most appropriate stochastic optimization method.</description>

      <title>Technical Report for Dissipativity Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a nonparametric framework for dissipativity learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, which enables data-driven certification of stability and performance properties for unknown nonlinear systems without requiring an explicit dynamic model. Dissipativity is a fundamental system property that generalizes Lyapunov stability, passivity, and finite L2 gain conditions through an energy balance inequality between a storage function and a supply rate. Unlike prior parametric formulations that approximate these functions using quadratic forms with fixed matrices, the proposed method represents them as Hilbert Schmidt operators acting on canonical kernel features, thereby capturing nonlinearities implicitly while preserving convexity and analytic tractability. The resulting operator optimization problem is formulated in the form of a one-class support vector machine and reduced, via the representer theorem, to a finite dimensional convex program expressed through kernel Gram matrices. Furthermore, statistical learning theory is applied to establish generalization guarantees, including confidence bounds on the dissipation rate and the L2 gain. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RKHS based dissipativity learning method effectively identifies nonlinear dissipative behavior directly from input output data, providing a powerful and interpretable framework for model free control analysis and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample MIMO System Identification with Multisine Excitation: Nonparametric, Direct, and Two-step Parametric Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multisine excitations are widely used for identifying multi-input multi-output systems due to their periodicity, data compression properties, and control over the input spectrum. Despite their popularity, the finite sample statistical properties of frequency-domain estimators under multisine excitation, for both nonparametric and parametric settings, remain insufficiently understood. This paper develops a finite-sample statistical framework for least-squares estimation of the frequency response function (FRF) and its implications for parametric modeling. First, we derive exact distributional and covariance properties of the FRF estimator, explicitly accounting for aliasing effects under slow sampling regimes, and establish conditions for unbiasedness, uncorrelatedness, and consistency across multiple experiments. Second, we show that the FRF estimate is a sufficient statistic for any parametric model under Gaussian noise, leading to an exact equivalence between optimal two stage frequency-domain methods and time-domain prediction error and maximum likelihood estimation. This equivalence is shown to yield finite-sample concentration bounds for parametric maximum likelihood estimators, enabling rigorous uncertainty quantification, and closed-form prediction error method estimators without iterative optimization. The theoretical results are demonstrated in a representative case study.</description>

      <title>Value of Multi-pursuer Single-evader Pursuit-evasion Game with Terminal Cost of Evader's Position: Relaxation of Convexity Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a multi-pursuer single-evader quantitative pursuit-evasion game with payoff function that includes only the terminal cost. The terminal cost is a function related only to the terminal position of the evader. This problem has been extensively studied in target defense games. Here, we prove that a candidate for the value function generated by geometric method is the viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation (HJI PDE) Dirichlet problem. Therefore, the value function of the game at each point can be computed by a mathematical program. In our work, the convexity of the terminal cost or the target is not required. The terminal cost only needs to be locally Lipschitz continuous. The cases in which the terminal costs or the targets are not convex are covered. Therefore, our result is more universal than those of previous studies, and the complexity of the proof is improved. We also discuss the optimal strategies in this game and present an intuitive explanation of this value function.</description>

Abstract: Energy storage can promote the integration of renewables by operating with charge and discharge policies that balance an intermittent power supply. This study investigates the scheduling of energy storage assets under energy price uncertainty, with a focus on electricity markets. A two-stage stochastic risk-constrained approach is employed, whereby electricity price trajectories or specific power markets are observed, allowing for recourse in the schedule. Conditional value-at-risk is used to quantify tail risk in the optimization problems; this allows for the explicit specification of a probabilistic risk limit. The proposed approach is tested in an integrated hydrogen system (IHS) and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In the joint design and operation context for the IHS, the risk constraint results in larger installed unit capacities, increasing capital cost but enabling more energy inventory to buffer price uncertainty. As shown in both case studies, there is an operational trade-off between risk and expected reward; this is reflected in higher expected costs (or lower expected profits) with increasing levels of risk aversion. Despite the decrease in expected reward, both systems exhibit substantial benefits of increasing risk aversion. This work provides a general method to address uncertainties in energy storage scheduling, allowing operators to input their level of risk tolerance on asset decisions.</description>

      <title>SpecAttn: Speculating Sparse Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms, particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19 dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide approximate verification without significant performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation by Local Design in Cooperative Networked Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the privacy preservation problem in a cooperative networked control system, which has closed-loop dynamics, working for the task of linear quadratic Guassian (LQG) control. The system consists of a user and a server: the user owns the plant to control, while the server provides computation capability, and the user employs the server to compute control inputs for it. To enable the server's computation, the user needs to provide the measurements of the plant states to the server, who then calculates estimates of the states, based on which the control inputs are computed. However, the user regards the states as privacy, and makes an interesting request: the user wants the server to have "incorrect" knowledge of the state estimates rather than the true values. Regarding that, we propose a novel design methodology for the privacy preservation, in which the privacy scheme is locally equipped at the user side not open to the server, which manages to create a deviation in the server's knowledge of the state estimates from the true values. However, this methodology also raises significant challenges: in a closed-loop dynamic system, when the server's seized knowledge is incorrect, the system's behavior becomes complex to analyze; even the stability of the system becomes questionable, as the incorrectness will accumulate through the closed loop as time evolves. In this paper, we succeed in showing that the performance loss in LQG control caused by the proposed privacy scheme is bounded by rigorous mathematical proofs, which convinces the availability of the proposed design methodology. We also propose an associated novel privacy metric and obtain the analytical result on evaluating the privacy performance. Finally, we study the performance trade-off between privacy and control, where the accordingly proposed optimization problems are solved by numerical methods efficiently.</description>

      <title>On the Detection of Shared Data Manipulation in Distributed Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the vulnerability of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to shared data manipulation, with a focus on solving optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Deliberate data manipulation may cause the ADMM algorithm to converge to suboptimal solutions. We derive a sufficient condition for detecting data manipulation based on the theoretical convergence trajectory of the ADMM algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the detection condition on three data manipulation strategies with various levels of complexity and stealth. The simplest attack sends the target values and each iteration, the second attack uses a feedback loop to find the next target values, and the last attack uses a bilevel optimization to find the target values. We then extend the three data manipulation strategies to avoid detection by the detection conditions and a neural network (NN) detection model. We also propose an adversarial NN training framework to detect shared data manipulation. We illustrate the performance of our data manipulation strategy and detection framework on OPF problems. The results show that the proposed detection condition successfully detects most of the data manipulation attacks. However, the bilevel optimization attack strategy that incorporates the detection methods may avoid being detected. Countering this, our proposed adversarial training framework detects all the instances of the bilevel optimization attack.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Convergent Distributed Multiobjective Optimization With Dynamic Event-Triggered Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed constrained multiobjective resource allocation problems (DCMRAPs) in multi-agent networks, where agents face multiple conflicting local objectives under local and global constraints. By reformulating DCMRAPs as single-objective weighted $L_p$ problems, the proposed approach enables distributed solutions without relying on predefined weighting coefficients or centralized decision-making. Leveraging prescribed-time control and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), a novel distributed algorithm is proposed within a prescribed time through sampled communication. Using generalized time-based generators (TBGs), the algorithm provides more flexibility in optimizing solution accuracy and trajectory smoothness without the constraints of initial conditions. Novel dynamic ETMs, integrated with generalized TBGs, improve communication efficiency by adapting to local error metrics and network-based disagreements, while providing enhanced flexibility in balancing solution accuracy and communication frequency. The Zeno behavior is excluded. Validated by Lyapunov analysis and simulation experiments, our method demonstrates superior control performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, advancing distributed optimization across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Kernel Mean Embedding Topology: Weak and Strong Forms for Stochastic Kernels and Implications for Model Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel topology, called Kernel Mean Embedding Topology, for stochastic kernels, in a weak and strong form. This topology, defined on the spaces of Bochner integrable functions from a signal space to a space of probability measures endowed with a Hilbert space structure, allows for a versatile formulation. This construction allows one to obtain both a strong and weak formulation. (i) For its weak formulation, we highlight the utility on relaxed policy spaces, and investigate connections with the Young narrow topology and Borkar (or \( w^* \))-topology, and establish equivalence properties. We report that, while both the \( w^* \)-topology and kernel mean embedding topology are relatively compact, they are not closed. Conversely, while the Young narrow topology is closed, it lacks relative compactness. (ii) We show that the strong form provides an appropriate formulation for placing topologies on spaces of models characterized by stochastic kernels with explicit robustness and learning theoretic implications on optimal stochastic control under discounted or average cost criteria. (iii) We thus show that this topology possesses several properties making it ideal to study optimality and approximations (under the weak formulation) and robustness (under the strong formulation) for many applications.</description>

Abstract: Climate science is the multidisciplinary field that studies the Earth's climate and its evolution. At the very core of climate science are indispensable climate models that predict future climate scenarios, inform policy decisions, and dictate how a country's economy should change in light of the changing climate. Climate models capture a wide range of interacting dynamic processes via extremely complex ordinary and partial differential equations. To model these large-scale complex processes, climate science leverages supercomputers, advanced simulations, and statistical methods to predict future climate. An area of engineering that is rarely studied in climate science is control engineering. Given that climate systems are inherently dynamic, it is intuitive to analyze them within the framework of dynamic system science. This perspective has been underexplored in the literature. In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial that: (i) introduces the control engineering community to climate dynamics and modeling, including spatiotemporal scales and challenges in climate modeling; (ii) offers a fresh perspective on climate models from a control systems viewpoint; and (iii) explores the relevance and applicability of various advanced graph and network control-based approaches in building a physics-informed framework for learning, control and estimation in climate systems. We also present simple and then more complex climate models, depicting fundamental ideas and processes that are instrumental in building climate change projections. This tutorial also builds parallels and observes connections between various contemporary problems at the forefront of climate science and their control theoretic counterparts. We specifically observe that an abundance of climate science problems can be linguistically reworded and mathematically framed as control theoretic ones.</description>

      <title>Partitioning and Observability in Linear Systems via Submodular Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network partitioning has gained recent attention as a pathway to enable decentralized operation and control in large-scale systems. This paper addresses the interplay between partitioning, observability, and sensor placement (SP) in dynamic networks. The problem, being computationally intractable at scale, is a largely unexplored, open problem in the literature. To that end, the paper's objective is designing scalable partitioning of linear systems while maximizing observability metrics of the subsystems. We show that the partitioning problem can be posed as a submodular maximization problem -- and the SP problem can subsequently be solved over the partitioned network. Consequently, theoretical bounds are derived to compare observability metrics of the original network with those of the resulting partitions, highlighting the impact of partitioning on system observability. Case studies on networks of varying sizes corroborate the derived theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Integrated Learning and Optimization to Control Load Demand and Wind Generation for Minimizing Ramping Cost in Real-Time Electricity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a new integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodology to predict context-aware unknown parameters in economic dispatch (ED), a crucial problem in power systems solved to generate optimal power dispatching decisions to serve consumer load. The ED formulation in the current study consists of load and renewable generation as unknown parameters in its constraints predicted using contextual information (e.g., prior load, temperature). The ILO framework train a neural network (NN) to estimate ED parameters by minimizing an application-specific regret function which is a difference between ground truth and NN-driven decisions favouring better ED decisions. We thoroughly analyze the feasible region of ED formulation to understand the impact of load and renewable learning together on the ED decisions. Corresponding to that we developed a new regret function to capture real-time electricity market operations where differences in predicted and true loads are corrected by ramping generators in real-time but at a higher cost than the market price. The proposed regret function when minimized using ILO framework train the NN to guide the load and renewable predictions to generate ED decisions favouring minimum generator ramping costs. This is unlike conventional sequential learning and optimization (SLO) framework which train NN to accurately estimate load and renewable instead of better ED decisions. The combined training of load and renewable using ILO is a new concept and lead to significantly improved ramping costs when compared with SLO based training of load and renewable and SLO trained load with 100% accurate renewable proving its decision-focused capability.</description>

      <title>Game Theoretic Resilience Recommendation Framework for CyberPhysical Microgrids Using Hypergraph MetaLearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and 5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing Chaotic Dependence and Degree-Structure Mechanisms in Optimal Pinning Control of Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying an optimal set of driver nodes to achieve synchronization via pinning control is a fundamental challenge in complex network science, limited by computational intractability and the lack of general theory. Here, leveraging a degree-based mean-field (annealed) approximation from statistical physics, we analytically reveal how the structural degree distribution systematically governs synchronization performance, and derive an analytic characterization of the globally optimal pinning set and constructive algorithms with linear complexity (dominated by degree sorting, O(N+M). The optimal configuration exhibits a chaotic dependence--a discontinuous sensitivity--on its cardinality, whereby adding a single node can trigger abrupt changes in node composition and control effectiveness. This structural transition fundamentally challenges traditional heuristics that assume monotonic performance gains with budget. Systematic experiments on synthetic and empirical networks confirm that the proposed approach consistently outperforms degree-, betweenness-, and other centrality-based baselines. Furthermore, we quantify how key degree-distribution features--low-degree saturation, high-degree cutoff, and the power-law exponent--govern achievable synchronizability and shape the form of optimal sets. These results offer a systematic understanding of how degree heterogeneity shapes the network controllability. Our work establishes a unified link between degree heterogeneity and spectral controllability, offering both mechanistic insights and practical design rules for optimal driver-node selection in diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research, even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society. Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further investigations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Optimal Control in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven approach for optimal control of nonlinear control-affine systems represented by a stochastic diffusion. The focus is on the scenario where both the nonlinear dynamics and stage cost functions are unknown, while only a control penalty function and constraints are provided. To this end, we embed state probability densities into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to leverage recent advances in operator regression, thereby identifying Markov transition operators associated with controlled diffusion processes. This operator learning approach integrates naturally with convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions that scale linearly with state dimensionality, effectively solving a wide range of nonlinear optimal control problems. Numerical results demonstrate its ability to address diverse nonlinear control tasks, including the depth regulation of an autonomous underwater vehicle.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the behavior of a dynamical system from noisy observations of its past outputs is a classical problem encountered across engineering and science. For linear systems with Gaussian inputs, the Kalman filter -- the best linear minimum mean-square error estimator of the state trajectory -- is optimal in the Bayesian sense. For nonlinear systems, Bayesian filtering is typically approached using suboptimal heuristics such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), or numerical methods such as particle filtering (PF). In this work, we show that transformers, employed in an in-context learning (ICL) setting, can implicitly infer hidden states in order to predict the outputs of a wide family of dynamical systems, without test-time gradient updates or explicit knowledge of the system model. Specifically, when provided with a short context of past input-output pairs and, optionally, system parameters, a frozen transformer accurately predicts the current output. In linear-Gaussian regimes, its predictions closely match those of the Kalman filter; in nonlinear regimes, its performance approaches that of EKF and PF. Moreover, prediction accuracy degrades gracefully when key parameters, such as the state-transition matrix, are withheld from the context, demonstrating robustness and implicit parameter inference. These findings suggest that transformer in-context learning provides a flexible, non-parametric alternative for output prediction in dynamical systems, grounded in implicit latent-state estimation.</description>

      <title>Downlink Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for LEO Satellite Mega-Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where multiple satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions on transmit and received signals, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in fading scenarios, considering significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, the number of UTs, the number of SAPs, the orbital altitude, and the service range affected by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results indicate that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT result in a higher coverage probability, despite the presence of multi-user interference (MUI). Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs that maximize system capacity for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, providing valuable insights for system design.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptation for Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical experiments is available here: https://youtu.be/9QX1Q5Ut9Rs</description>

      <title>Action Chunking and Exploratory Data Collection Yield Exponential Improvements in Behavior Cloning for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Synthesis of Switched Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployment of optimization algorithms on networked systems face challenges associated with time delays and corruptions. One particular instance is the presence of time-varying delays arising from factors such as packet drops and irregular sampling. Fixed time delays can destabilize gradient descent algorithms, and this degradation is exacerbated by time-varying delays. This work concentrates on the analysis and creation of discrete-time optimization algorithms with certified exponential convergence rates that are robust against switched uncertainties between the optimizer and the gradient oracle. These optimization algorithms are implemented by a switch-scheduled output feedback controllers. Rate variation and sawtooth behavior (packet drops) in time-varying delays can be imposed through constraining switching sequences. Analysis is accomplished by bisection in the convergence rate to find Zames-Falb filter coefficents. Synthesis is performed by alternating between a filter coefficient search for a fixed controller, and a controller search for fixed multipliers.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>
