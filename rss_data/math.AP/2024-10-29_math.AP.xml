      <title>Global weak solutions to a two-dimensional doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system with logistic source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system with logistic source \begin{align} \begin{cases}\tag{$\star$}\label{eq 0.1} u_t=\nabla \cdot(u^{l-1} v \nabla u)- \nabla \cdot\left(u^{l} v \nabla v\right)+ u - u^2, \\ v_t=\Delta v-u v \end{cases} \end{align} in a smooth bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, where $l \geqslant 1$. It is proved that for all reasonably regular initial data, the corresponding homogeneous Neumann initial-boundary value problem \eqref{eq 0.1} possesses a global weak solution which is continuous in its first and essentially smooth in its second component. We point out that when $l = 2$, our result is consistent with that of [G. Li and M. Winkler, Analysis and Applications, (2024)].</description>

      <title>Regularity of Solutions for Peridynamics Equilibrium and Evolution Equations on Periodic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results on the peridynamics equilibrium and evolution equations over the space of periodic vector-distributions in multi-spatial dimensions are presented. The associated operator considered is the linear state-based peridynamic operator for a homogeneous material. Results for weakly singular (integrable) as well as singular integral kernels are developed. The asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the peridynamic operator's Fourier multipliers and eigenvalues are characterized explicitly in terms of the nonlocality (peridynamic horizon), the integral kernel singularity, and the spatial dimension. We build on the asymptotic analysis to develop regularity of solutions results for the peridynamic equilibrium as well as the peridynamic evolution equations over periodic distribution. The regularity results are presented explicitly in terms of the data, the integral kernel singularity, and the spatial dimension. Nonlocal-to-local convergence results are presented for the eigenvalues of the peridynamic operator and for the solutions of the equilibrium and evolution equations. The local limiting behavior is shown for two types of limits as the peridynamic horizon (nonlocality) vanishes or as the integral kernel becomes hyper-singular.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of a linear elastic body with rigid inclusions and a Robin type boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study of the limiting behaviour of an elastic material with periodically distributed rigid inclusions of size {\epsilon}, as the small parameter {\epsilon} goes to zero. We address here the case with inclusions of the same size as the period of the structure. The body in consideration here is suppose to be clamped on one part of its exterior boundary and submitted to given tractions on the other. By means of the well known two-scale convergence techniques, one convergence result is proved.</description>

      <title>Shape Derivatives of Eigenvalues of the de Rham Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study eigenvalue problems for the de Rham complex on varying three dimensional domains. Our analysis includes both the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell system with mixed boundary conditions and non-constant coefficients. We provide Hadamard-type formulas for the shape derivatives under weak regularity assumptions on the domain and its perturbations. Proofs are based on abstract results adapted to varying Hilbert complexes. As a bypass product of our analysis we give a proof of the celebrated Helmann-Feynman theorem for simple eigenvalues assuming differentiability of the corresponding eigenvectors. In a forthcoming publication we aim for a more general result involving also multiple eigenvalues of suitable families of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces depending on possibly infinite dimensional parameters.</description>

      <title>Improved regularity estimates for Hardy-H\'{e}non-type equations driven by the $\infty$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish sharp and improved regularity estimates for viscosity solutions of Hardy-H\'{e}non-type equations with possibly singular weights and strong absorption governed by the $\infty$-Laplacian $$
  \Delta_{\infty} u(x) = |x|^{\alpha}u_+^m(x) \quad \text{in} \quad B_1, $$ under suitable assumptions on the data. In this setting, we derive an explicit regularity exponent that depends only on universal parameters. Additionally, we prove non-degeneracy properties, providing further geometric insights into the nature of these solutions. Our regularity estimates not only improve but also extend, to some extent, the previously obtained results for zero-obstacle and dead-core problems driven by the $\infty$-Laplacian. As an application of our findings, we also address some Liouville-type results for this class of equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the following model problem, involving singularities and inhomogeneous Robin boundary conditions \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta_{p}u_{p}=\frac{f}{u_{p}^{\gamma}}&amp; \hbox{in $\Omega,$}
  \frac{\partial u_{p}}{\partial \sigma}+\lambda\vert u_{p}\vert^{p-2} u_{p}+\vert u_{p}\vert^{s-1}u_{p}=\frac{g}{u_{p}^{\eta}} &amp; \hbox{on $\partial\Omega,$}
  \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{m}$ represents an open bounded domain, with smooth boundary, $m \geq 2$, the symbol $\sigma $ stands for the unit outward normal vector, $ \Delta_{p}u:=\mbox{div}(\vert\nabla u\vert^{p-2}\nabla u) $ is the $p-$Laplacian operator $(1\leq p&lt;m),$ consider $0&lt;\gamma\leq 1,$ $ \eta&gt;0$ and $s\geq 1.$ The function $ f\in L^{\frac{m}{p}}(\Omega)$ is a nonnegative additionally $ \lambda$ and $ g$ are nonnegative functions in $L^{\infty}(\partial \Omega).$</description>

      <title>The stability threshold for 2D MHD equations around Couette with general viscosity and magnetic resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a threshold problem of the Couette flow $(y,0)$ in a uniform magnetic field $(\beta,0)$ for the 2D MHD equation on $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}$ with fluid viscosity $\nu$ and magnetic resistivity $\mu$. The nonlinear enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping are also established. In particularly, when $0&lt;\nu\leq\mu^3\leq1$, we get a threshold $\nu^{\frac{1}{2}}\mu^{\frac{1}{3}}$ in $H^N(N\geq4)$. When $0&lt;\mu^3\leq\nu\leq1$, we obtain a threshold $\min\{\nu^{\frac{1}{2}},\mu^{\frac{1}{2}}\}\min\{1,\nu^{-1}\mu^{\frac{1}{3}}\}$, hence improving the results in [19,14,21].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20419v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate estimates about the Laplace operator in heat flows of harmonic maps, focusing outside the singularities through spherical coordinates. These estimates can be used in the general Ericksen--Leslie system to obtain higher-order estimates. We consider the problem subject to the $\mathbb{T}^2$ and $\mathbb{T}^3$ boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Peaked Stokes waves as solutions of Babenko's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Babenko's equation describes traveling water waves in holomorphic coordinates. It has been used in the past to obtain properties of Stokes waves with smooth profiles analytically and numerically. We show in the deep-water limit that properties of Stokes waves with peaked profiles can also be recovered from the same Babenko's equation. In order to develop the local analysis of singularities, we rewrite Babenko's equation as a fixed-point problem near the maximal elevation level. As a by-product, our results rule out a corner point singularity in the holomorphic coordinates, which has been obtained in a local version of Babenko's equation.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of the Hall-MHD system in a critical setting of Besov-Morrey type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the 3D incompressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic system (Hall-MHD). Our objective is to provide local and global well-posedness results for initial velocity $u_{0}$, magnetic field $B_{0}$ and the current $J_{0}:=\nabla\times B_{0}$ in a new critical framework, namely critical Besov-Morrey spaces. These spaces combine typical characteristics from both Besov and Morrey spaces allowing a broader framework that encompasses the regularity properties inherent in Besov spaces with the Morrey space structure. Compared to previous works in Sobolev and Besov spaces, our approach accommodates a broader class of initial data, ensuring the construction of a unique solution over time.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates and generalized Boussinesq equation on hyperbolic spaces with rough initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generalized Boussinesq (GBq) equation on the real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ ($n\geq2$) in a rough framework based on Lorentz spaces. First, we establish dispersive estimates for the GBq-prototype group, which is associated with a core term of the linear part of the GBq equation, through a manifold-intrinsic Fourier analysis and estimates for oscillatory integrals in $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Then, we obtain dispersive estimates for the GBq-prototype and Boussinesq groups on Lorentz spaces in the context of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Employing those estimates, we obtain local and global well-posedness results and scattering properties in such framework. Moreover, we prove the polynomial stability of mild solutions and leverage this to improve the scattering decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish continuous and compact embeddings for a new class of Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces in unbounded domains driven by a double phase operator with variable exponents that depend on the unknown solution and its gradient. Using these embeddings and an abstract critical point theorem, we prove the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions for such problems associated with this new operator in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$. This work can be seen as a continuation of the recent paper by Bahrouni--Bahrouni--Missaoui--R\u{a}dulescu \cite{Bahrouni-Bahrouni-Missaoui-Radulescu-2024}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and a metric that is singular at the boundary. The associated Laplace-Beltrami operator is of the form of a Grushin operator plus a singular potential. In a supercritical parameter regime, we identify the rate of concentration and profile of the high-frequency eigenfunctions that accumulate at the boundary. We give an application to acoustic modes on gas planets.</description>

      <title>Global current-vortex sheets in the two-dimensional ideal incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamic current-vortex sheet is a free boundary problem involving a moving free surface separating two plasma regions. We prove the global nonlinear stability of current-vortex sheet in the two dimensional ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics under the strong horizontal background magnetic field. This appears to be the first result on the global solutions of the free boundary problems for the ideal (inviscid and non-resistive) incompressible rotational fluids. The strong magnetic field plays a crucial role in the global in time stabilization effect. The proof relies on the understanding of the interplay between the dynamics of the fluids inside the domain and on the free interface, a design of multiple-level energy estimates with different weights, and the inherent structures of the problem.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for the space-time fractional Schr\"odinger equation on closed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an inverse problem for an uncoupled space-time fractional Schr\"odinger equation on closed manifolds. Our main goal is to determine the fractional powers and the Riemannian metric (up to an isometry) simultaneously from the knowledge of the associated source-to-solution map. Our argument relies on the asymptotic behavior of Mittag-Leffler functions, Weyl's law for the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, the unique continuation property of the space-fractional operator and the disjoint data metric determination result for the wave equation. We also provide a probabilistic formulation of our inverse problem.</description>

      <title>On shape optimization for fourth order Steklov eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three types of fourth-order Steklov eigenvalue problems. For the first two of them, we derive the asymptotic expansion of their spectra on Euclidean annular domains $\mathbb{B}^n_1\setminus \overline{\mathbb{B}^n_\epsilon}$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, leading to conclusions on shape optimization. For these two problems, we also compute their spectra on cylinders over closed Riemannian manifolds. Last, for the third problem, we obtain a sharp upper bound for its first non-zero eigenvalue on star-shaped and mean convex Euclidean domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>

      <title>Long time behaviour of generalised gradient flows via occupational measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces new methods to study the long time behaviour of the generalised gradient flow associated with a solution of the critical equation for mechanical Hamiltonian system posed on the flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. For this analysis it is necessary to look at the critical set of $u$ consisting of all the points on $\mathbb{T}^d$ such that zero belongs to the super-differential of such a solution. Indeed, such a set turns out to be an attractor for the generalised gradient flow. Moreover, being the critical set the union of two subsets of rather different nature, namely the regular critical set and the singular set, we are interested in establishing whether the generalised gradient flow approaches the former or the latter as $t\to \infty$. One crucial tool of our analysis is provided by limiting occupational measures, a family of measures that are invariant under the generalized flow. Indeed, we show that by integrating the potential with respect to such measures, one can deduce whether the generalised gradient flow enters the singular set in finite time, or it approaches the regular critical set as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general scale-dependent Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type identity involving a vector field on the hyperbolic space. By choosing suitable parameter, potential and vector field in this identity, we can recover, as well as derive new versions of several Poincar\'{e} type, Hardy type and Poincar\'{e}-Hardy type inequalities in the literature. We also investigate weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities on hyperbolic space, where the weight functions depend on a scaling parameter. This leads to a new family of scale-dependent Poincar\'{e} inequalities with Gaussian type measure on the hyperbolic space which is of independent interest. As a result, we derive both scale-dependent and scale-invariant $L^{2}$-stability results for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in this setting.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and Sobolev norms inflation for the quantum Euler equations on tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of solutions to the quantum Euler equations on $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d\geqslant 2$, with almost constant mass density, displaying energy transfers to high Fourier modes and polynomially fast-in-time growth of Sobolev norms above the finite-energy level. These solutions are uniformly far from vacuum, suggesting that weak turbulence in quantum hydrodynamics is not necessarily related to the occurrence of vortex structures.
  In view of possible connections with instability mechanisms for the classical compressible Euler equations, we also keep track of the dependence on the semiclassical parameter, showing that, at high regularity, the time at which the Sobolev norm inflations occur is uniform when approaching the semiclassical limit.
  Our construction relies on a novel result of Sobolev instability for the plane waves of the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS), which is connected to the quantum Euler equations through the Madelung transform}. More precisely, we show the existence of smooth solutions to NLS, which are small-amplitude perturbations of a plane wave and undergo a polynomially fast $H^s$-norm inflation for $s&gt;1$. The proof is based on a partial Birkhoff normal form procedure, involving the normalization of non-homogeneous Hamiltonian terms.</description>

      <title>A New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws: Convexity Degeneracy of Flux Functions and Fine Properties of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. Our primary aim of this paper is to introduce and validate a novel formula for entropy solutions for this Cauchy problem, specifically tailored to the flux functions satisfying (1.3) which allow the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. This formulation serves as a generalization of the Lax--Oleinik formula that necessitates the flux function to possess uniform convexity. Furthermore, we explore several key applications of this new formula to analyze fine properties of entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem with flux functions allowing for convexity degeneracy and initial data only in $L^\infty$; these especially include: (i) Fine structures of entropy solutions, (ii) Global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions, and (iii) Asymptotic profiles of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$ in both the $L^\infty$-norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$-norm. Through these analyses, we provide a comprehensive understanding of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) allowing the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. Moreover, the new solution formula is extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with initial data in $L^1_{{\rm loc}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an inverse problem of identifying two spatial-temporal source terms in the Schr\"odinger equation with dynamic boundary conditions from the final time overdetermination. We adopt a weak solution approach to solve the inverse source problem. By analyzing the associated Tikhonov functional, we prove a gradient formula of the functional in terms of the solution to a suitable adjoint system, allowing us to obtain the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Next, the existence and uniqueness of a quasi-solution are also investigated. Finally, our theoretical results are validated by numerical experiments in one dimension using the Landweber iteration method.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability in a free boundary model of active locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest model of contraction-driven self-propulsion of keratocytes reduces to a one dimensional Keller-Segel system with free boundaries. This "active" model involving both dissipation and anti-dissipation features stationary and traveling wave solutions representing static and moving cells, respectively. The goal of this paper is to provide the first rigorous proof of the asymptotic nonlinear stability of both of such solutions. In the case of stationary solutions, the linear stability is established using the spectral theorem for compact, self-adjoint operators, and thus linear stability is determined solely by eigenvalues. For traveling waves the picture is more complex because the linearized problem is non-self-adjoint, opening the possibility of a "dark" area in the phase space which is not "visible" in the purely eigenvalue/eigenvector approach. To establish linear stability in this case we employ spectral methods together with the Gearhart-Pruss-Greiner Theorem, which requires a uniform bound on the resolvent of the linear operator. For both stationary and traveling wave solutions, nonlinear stability is then proved by showing how the nonlinear part of the problem may be controlled by the linear part and then employing a Gr\"onwall inequality argument. The developed methodology can prove useful also in other problems involving non-Hermitian and non-reciprocal operators which are ubiquitous in the description of active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of a non-convex minimization problem by Lachand-Robert and Peletier, they found that the difference between the compactly supported perturbation $u+\epsilon h$ of a strictly convex function $u$, and the $\Gamma$-regularization of $u+\epsilon h$, is at most $o(\epsilon)$. Here we find that this result is optimal, albeit they expected a much stronger estimate.</description>

      <title>The impact of a wind switch on the stability of traveling fronts in a reaction-diffusion model of fire propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For certain values of the wave speed parameter, evolution equations for the temperature of a region of fuel admit traveling wave solutions describing fire fronts. We consider such a system in the form of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation with a first-order forcing term capturing the combined effects of ambient and fire-induced wind. The fire-induced wind is introduced by way of a piecewise continuous function that ``switches'' in space. We demonstrate that, in the case of a spatially dependent wind, traveling wave solutions corresponding to fire fronts exist for a continuum of wave speeds rather than for a single unique speed. Using geometric methods, we determine the range of allowable speeds, refine this range to only those fronts which will persist in nature, and develop a selection mechanism to identify the specific wind configuration corresponding to the most stable solution. For this spectrally preferred front, we find that the wind switch occurs ahead of the fireline in a manner consistent with the physics of air entrainment. Even when the wind is not coupled to the temperature and is instead imposed as an external forcing, the conditions on the existence and stability of front solutions force the wind term in to a configuration reflective of physical reality.</description>

      <title>Generic Solutions to Controlled Balance Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with a scalar balance law, where the source term depends on a control function $\alpha(t)$. Given a control $\alpha\in \mathbf{L}^\infty\bigl([0,T]\bigr)$, it is proved that, for generic initial data $\bar u \in \mathcal{C}^3(\mathbb{R})$, the solution has finitely many shocks, interacting at most two at a time. Moreover, at the terminal time $T$ no shock interaction occurs, and no new shock is formed.
  In addition, a family of optimal control problems is considered, including a running cost and a terminal cost. An example is constructed where the optimal solution contains two shocks merging exactly at the terminal time $T$. Such behavior persists under any suitably small perturbation of the flux, source, and cost functions, and of the initial data. This shows that generic solutions of optimization problems have different qualitative properties, compared with generic solutions to Cauchy problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Kernel Approximation of Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to answer a few open questions in the interface of kernel methods and PDE gradient flows. Motivated by recent advances in machine learning, particularly in generative modeling and sampling, we present a rigorous investigation of Fisher-Rao and Wasserstein type gradient flows concerning their gradient structures, flow equations, and their kernel approximations. Specifically, we focus on the Fisher-Rao (also known as Hellinger) geometry and its various kernel-based approximations, developing a principled theoretical framework using tools from PDE gradient flows and optimal transport theory. We also provide a complete characterization of gradient flows in the maximum-mean discrepancy (MMD) space, with connections to existing learning and inference algorithms. Our analysis reveals precise theoretical insights linking Fisher-Rao flows, Stein flows, kernel discrepancies, and nonparametric regression. We then rigorously prove evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence for kernel-approximated Fisher-Rao flows, providing theoretical guarantees beyond pointwise convergence. Finally, we analyze energy dissipation using the Helmholtz-Rayleigh principle, establishing important connections between classical theory in mechanics and modern machine learning practice. Our results provide a unified theoretical foundation for understanding and analyzing approximations of gradient flows in machine learning applications through a rigorous gradient flow and variational method perspective.</description>

      <title>A complete description of the asymptotic behavior at infinity of positive radial solutions to $\Delta^2 u = u^\alpha$ in $\mathbf R^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.11520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the biharmonic equation $\Delta^2 u = u^\alpha$ in $\mathbf R^n$ with $n \geqslant 1$. It was proved that this equation has a positive classical solution if, and only if, either $\alpha \leqslant 1$ with $n \geqslant 1$ or $\alpha\geqslant (n+4)/(n-4)$ with $n \geqslant 5$. The asymptotic behavior at infinity of all positive radial solutions was known in the case $\alpha\geqslant (n+4)/(n-4)$ and $n \geqslant 5$. In this paper, we classify the asymptotic behavior at infinity of all positive radial solutions in the remaining case $\alpha\leqslant 1$ with $n \geqslant 1$; hence obtaining a complete picture of the asymptotic behavior at infinity of positive radial solutions. Since the underlying equation is higher order, we propose a new approach which relies on a representation formula and asymptotic analysis arguments. We believe that the approach introduced here can be conveniently applied to study other problems with higher order operators.</description>

      <title>Convex monotone semigroups and their generators with respect to $\Gamma$-convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08653v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study semigroups of convex monotone operators on spaces of continuous functions and their behaviour with respect to $\Gamma$-convergence. In contrast to the linear theory, the domain of the generator is, in general, not invariant under the semigroup. To overcome this issue, we consider different versions of invariant Lipschitz sets which turn out to be suitable domains for weaker notions of the generator. The so-called $\Gamma$-generator is defined as the time derivative with respect to $\Gamma$-convergence in the space of upper semicontinuous functions. Under suitable assumptions, we show that the $\Gamma$-generator uniquely characterizes the semigroup and is determined by its evaluation at smooth functions. Furthermore, we provide Chernoff approximation results for convex monotone semigroups and show that approximation schemes based on the same infinitesimal behaviour lead to the same semigroup. Our results are applied to semigroups related to stochastic optimal control problems in finite and infinite-dimensional settings as well as Wasserstein perturbations of transition semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nonlocal equations of order larger than one with measure data and prove gradient regularity in Sobolev and H\"older spaces as well as pointwise bounds of the gradient in terms of Riesz potentials, leading to fine regularity results in many commonly used function spaces. The kernel of the integral operators involves a H\"older dependence in the variables and is not assumed to be translation invariant.</description>

Abstract: We show that a generic levelset of the viscosity solution to mean curvature flow is a distributional solution in the framework of sets of finite perimeter by Luckhaus and Sturzenhecker, which in addition saturates the optimal energy dissipation rate. This extends the fundamental work of Evans and Spruck (J. Geom. Anal. 1995), which draws a similar connection between the viscosity solution and Brakke flows.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric conditions, lower semicontinuity, and existence results for perimeter functionals with measure data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13396v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish lower semicontinuity results for perimeter functionals with measure data on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and deduce the existence of minimizers to these functionals with Dirichlet boundary conditions, obstacles, or volume-constraints. In other words, we lay foundations of a perimeter-based variational approach to mean curvature measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ capable of proving existence in various prescribed-mean-curvature problems with measure data. As crucial and essentially optimal assumption on the measure data we identify a new condition, called small-volume isoperimetric condition, which sharply captures cancellation effects and comes with surprisingly many properties and reformulations in itself. In particular, we show that the small-volume isoperimetric condition is satisfied for a wide class of $(n{-}1)$-dimensional measures, which are thus admissible in our theory. Our analysis includes infinite measures and semicontinuity results on very general domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

Abstract: We study an inverse boundary value problem for a polyharmonic operator in two dimensions. We show that the Cauchy data uniquely determine all the anisotropic perturbations of orders at most $m-1$ and several perturbations of orders $m$ to $2m-2$ under some restriction. The uniqueness proof relies on the $\bar{\partial}$-techniques and the method of stationary phase.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Solutions to Silent Wave Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of solutions to a particular class of systems of linear wave equations, namely, of silent equations. We obtain asymptotic estimates of all orders for the solutions, and show that solutions are uniquely determined by the asymptotic data contained in the estimates. As an application, we then study solutions to the source free Maxwell's equations in Kasner spacetimes near the initial singularity. Our results allow us to obtain an asymptotic expansion for the potential of the electromagnetic field, and to show that the energy density of generic solutions blows up along generic timelike geodesics when approaching the singularity. The asymptotics we study correspond to the heuristics of the BKL conjecture, where the coefficients of the spatial derivative terms of the equations are expected to be small, and thus these terms are neglected in order to obtain the asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of the electronic structure of heavy atoms, relativistic effects cannot be neglected and the Dirac operator naturally appears in place of the Schr\"odinger operator, raising a number of additional difficulties. The complexity of these systems has been addressed by various approximations. We consider a model consisting of differential equations coupling the time evolution of a finite number of relativistic electrons with the Newtonian dynamics of finitely many nuclei. The electrons are described by the Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock (BDF) equation of quantum electrodynamics (QED). This system can be seen as a first step in the study of molecular dynamics phenomena, when both relativistic and quantum effects have to be taken into account for the electrons. We address the Cauchy problem for this model and prove global well-posedness.</description>

Abstract: In this article, for $N \geq 2, s \in (1,2), p\in (1, \frac{N}{s}), \sigma=s-1 $ and $a \in [0, \frac{N-sp}{2})$, we establish an isometric isomorphism between the higher order fractional weighted Beppo-Levi space \begin{align*}
  {\mathcal D}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N) := \overline{\mathcal{C}_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)}^{[\cdot]_{s,p,a}} \text{ where } [u]_{s,p,a} := \left( \iint_{\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N} \frac{\left| \nabla u(x) -\nabla u(y) \right|^p}{\left|x-y \right|^{N+\sigma p}} \, \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{|x|^a} \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{|y|^a} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}, \end{align*} and higher order fractional weighted homogeneous space \begin{align*}
  \mathring{W}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N):= \left\{u \in L_a^{p^*_s}(\mathbb{R}^N): \| \nabla u \|_{L_a^{p^*_{\sigma}}(\mathbb{R}^N)} + [u]_{s,p,a} &lt; \infty \right\} \end{align*} with the weighted Lebesgue norm \begin{align*}
  \| u \|_{L_a^{p^*_{\alpha}}(\mathbb{R}^N)}:= \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{ |u(x)|^{p^*_{\alpha}}}{|x|^{\frac{2ap^*_{\alpha}}{p}}} \, {\mathrm{d}x} \right)^{\frac{1}{p^*_{\alpha}}}, \text{ where } p^*_{\alpha}=\frac{Np}{N-\alpha p} \text{ for } \alpha= s,\sigma. \end{align*} To achieve this, we prove that $\mathcal{C}_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is dense in $\mathring{W}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with respect to $[\cdot]_{s,p,a}$, and $[\cdot]_{s,p,a}$ is an equivalent norm on $\mathring{W}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Further, we obtain a finer embedding of ${\mathcal D}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N)$ into the Lorentz space $L^{\frac{Np}{N-sp-2a}, p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$, where $L^{\frac{Np}{N-sp-2a}, p}(\mathbb{R}^N) \subsetneq L_a^{p^*_s}(\mathbb{R}^N)$.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness in the critical regularity setting for hyperbolic systems with partial diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the local existence theory of the Cauchy problem for a general class of symmetrizable hyperbolic partially diffusive systems (also called hyperbolic-parabolic systems) in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\ge 1$. We address the question of well-posedness for large data having critical Besov regularity in the spirit of previous works by the second author on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to the pioneering of Kawashima (S. Kawashima. Systems of a hyperbolic parabolic type with applications to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. PhD thesis, Kyoto University, 1983) and to the more recent work by Serre (D. Serre. Local existence for viscous system of conservation laws: $H^s$-data with $s &gt; 1+d/2$. In Nonlinear partial differential equations and hyperbolic wave phenomena, volume 526 of Contemp. Math., pages 339-358. Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2010), we take advantage of the partial parabolicity of the system to consider data in functional spaces that need not be embedded in the set of Lipschitz functions. This is in sharp contrast with the classical well-posedness theory of (multi-dimensional) hyperbolic systems where it is mandatory. A leitmotiv of our analysis is to require less regularity for the components experiencing a direct diffusion, than for the hyperbolic components. We then use an energy method that is performed on the system after spectral localization and a suitable G\r{a}rding inequality. As an example, we consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference (FD) method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWEs) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation by parts (SBP) FD operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions (BCs) for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear vector invariant SWE in the subcritical regime, where energy is an entropy functional, we find that energy/entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing SBP framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove both nonlinear and local linear stability results, as well as a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWEs. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for systems of nonlocal balance laws modeling dense multilane vehicular traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled system of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution is proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, as opposed to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., drad101, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is also indicated. Numerical simulations illustrating the theory and the behavior of the entropy solution as the support of the kernel goes to zero (nonlocal to local limit), are shown.</description>

Abstract: Cellular scale decision making is modulated by the dynamics of signalling molecules and their diffusive trajectories from a source to small absorbing sites on the cellular surface. Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the one-dimensional Stochastic Stefan Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20389</link>

Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional outer stochastic Stefan problem with reflection which models the short-time prediction of the price or spread of one volatile asset traded in a financial market. The problem admits maximal solutions as long as the velocity of the moving boundary stays bounded, [3,7,8]. We apply Malliavin calculus on the transformed equation and prove first that its maximal solution u has continuous paths a.s. In the case of the unreflected problem, the previous enables localization of a proper approximating sequence of the maximal solution. Then, we derive there locally the differentiability of maximal $u$ in the Malliavin sense. The novelty of this work, apart from the derivation of continuity of the paths for the maximal solution with reflection, is that for the unreflected case we introduce a localization argument on maximal solutions and define efficiently the relevant sample space. More precisely, we prove the local (in the sample space) existence of the Malliavin derivative and, under certain conditions on the noise coefficient, the absolute continuity of the law of the solution with respect to the Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Physics-informed neural networks for multiscale heat conduction via phonon Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10965</link>

Abstract: The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely used for describing multiscale heat conduction (from nm to $\mu$m or mm) in solid materials. Developing numerical approaches to solve this equation is challenging since it is a 7-dimensional integral-differential equation. In this work, we propose Monte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", to solve the phonon BTE to model the multiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural network to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic differentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to address inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods in PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in the temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points randomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points at each step are constructed based on the data drawn from the above two steps using the tensor product. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat conduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more memory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs for BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction in a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domains, are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the MC-PINNs for heat conduction spanning diffusive and ballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage of the MC-PINNs and one of the state-of-the-art numerical methods to demonstrate the potential of the MC-PINNs for large scale problems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Subspace Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Travel-Time Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely studied as effective generative tools for solving inverse problems. The main ideas focus on performing the reverse sampling process conditioned on noisy measurements, using well-established numerical solvers for gradient updates. Although diffusion-based sampling methods can produce high-quality reconstructions, challenges persist in nonlinear PDE-based inverse problems and sampling speed. In this work, we explore solving PDE-based travel-time tomography based on subspace diffusion generative models. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose a posterior sampling process for PDE-based inverse problems by solving the associated adjoint-state equation. Second, we resorted to the subspace-based dimension reduction technique for conditional sampling acceleration, enabling solving the PDE-based inverse problems from coarse to refined grids. Our numerical experiments showed satisfactory advancements in improving the travel-time imaging quality and reducing the sampling time for reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Curve Shortening Flow of Space Curves with Convex Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that under Space Curve Shortening flow any closed immersed curve in $\mathbb R^n$ whose projection onto $\mathbb{R}^2\times\{\vec{0}\}$ is convex remains smooth until it shrinks to a point. Throughout its evolution, the projection of the curve onto $\mathbb{R}^2\times\{\vec{0}\}$ remains convex.
  As an application, we show that any closed immersed curve in $\mathbb R^n$ can be perturbed to an immersed curve in $\mathbb R^{n+2}$ whose evolution by Space Curve Shortening shrinks to a point.</description>
