      <title>Reducing Frequency Bias of Fourier Neural Operators In 3D Seismic Wavefield Simulations Through Multi-Stage Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of Neural Operator (NeurOp) learning for solutions to the elastic wave equation shows promising results and provides the basis for fast large-scale simulations for different seismological applications. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to directly solve the 3D Helmholtz wave equation for fast forward seismic simulations on different frequencies, and show the frequency bias of the FNO model, i.e. it learns the lower frequencies better comparing to the higher frequencies. To reduce the frequency bias, we adopt the multi-stage FNO training, i.e., after training a 1st stage FNO model for estimating the ground motion, we use a second FNO model as the 2nd stage to learn from the residual, which greatly reduced the errors on the higher frequencies. By adopting this multi-stage training, the FNO models show reduced biases on higher frequencies, which enhanced the overall results of the ground motion simulations. Thus the multi-stage training FNO improves the accuracy and realism of the ground motion simulations.</description>

      <title>Generating Reliable Initial Velocity Models for Full-waveform Inversion with Well and Structural Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) plays an important role in velocity modeling due to its high-resolution advantages. However, its highly non-linear characteristic leads to numerous local minimums, which is known as the cycle-skipping problem. Therefore, effectively addressing the cycle-skipping issue is crucial to the success of FWI. Well-log data contain rich information about subsurface medium parameters, providing inherent advantages for velocity modeling. Traditional well-log data interpolation methods to build velocity models have limited accuracy and poor adaptability to complex geological structures. This study introduces a well interpolation algorithm based on a generative diffusion model (GDM) to generate initial models for FWI, addressing the cycle-skipping problem. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods face difficulties in handling complex feature distributions and lack effective uncertainty quantification, limiting the reliability of their outputs. The proposed GDM-based approach overcomes these challenges by providing geologically consistent well interpolation while incorporating uncertainty assessment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method produces accurate and reliable initial models, enhancing FWI performance and mitigating cycle-skipping issues.</description>

      <title>What is glacier sliding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glacier and ice-sheet motion is fundamental to glaciology. However, there is still no clear consensus for the optimal way to describe the sliding component of glacier and ice-sheet dynamics. Typically, sliding is parameterised using a traction coefficient linked to a given theory describing one or a limited set of sliding processes. However, this precludes the possibility of multiple simultaneous and spatio-temporally varying sliding modes with inaccuracies resulting in model error propagation as the system evolves away from the conditions under which it was optimised for. Here, we describe glacier sliding as a scale- and setting-dependent 'inner flow' that arises from multiple overlapping sub-processes, including viscous ice deformation and obstacle resistance (or 'form drag'), thereby bridging divides between hard and soft beds and rough and smooth beds. The corresponding 'outer flow' then accounts for ice deformation that is only minimally influenced by bed properties. We propose that the importance of 'Iken's bound' can then be significantly reduced if viscous ice deformation becomes a significant process in a given region within the inner flow, which may explain the persistent functionality of power-law sliding in large-scale process-agnostic sliding studies over rough topography. Last, reviewing observation-based studies and considering the sheer diversity of sliding processes, we suggest that a simple 'unified' sliding relationship controlled by a single tunable coefficient may not be realistic. However, we show that given reasonable assumptions, all sliding relationships should fall somewhere between regularised-Coulomb and power-law end members, and that a power-law, or compound relationship with careful consideration of the power value may provide the most flexible way to account for the varied net effect of compound sliding sub-processes.</description>
