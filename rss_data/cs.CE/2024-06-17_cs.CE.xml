      <title>Computational generation of tailored radionuclide libraries for alpha-particle and gamma-ray spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radionuclide identification is a radioanalytical method employed in various scientific disciplines that utilize alpha-particle or gamma-ray spectrometric assays, ranging from astrophysics to nuclear medicine. Radionuclide libraries in conventional radionuclide identification systems are crafted in a manual fashion, accompanying labor-intensive and error-prone user tasks and hindering library customization. This research presents a computational algorithm and the architecture of its dedicated software that can automatically generate tailored radionuclide libraries. Progenitor-progeny recurrence relations were modeled to enable recursive computation of radionuclide subsets. This theoretical concept was incorporated into open-source software called RecurLib and validated against four actinide decay series and twelve radioactive substances, including a uranium-glazed legacy Fiestaware, natural uranium and thorium sources, a $^{226}$Ra sample, and the medical radionuclides $^{225}$Ac, $^{177}$Lu, and $^{99\text{m}}$Tc. The developed algorithm yielded radionuclide libraries for all the tested specimens within minutes, demonstrating its efficiency and applicability across diverse scenarios. The proposed approach introduces a framework for computerized radionuclide library generation, thereby trivializing library-driven radionuclide identification and facilitating the spectral recognition of unregistered radionuclides in radiation spectrometry.</description>

      <title>SplineGen: a generative model for B-spline approximation of unorganized points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based method to solve the traditional parameterization and knot placement problems in B-spline approximation. Different from conventional heuristic methods or recent AI-based methods, the proposed method does not assume ordered or fixed-size data points as input. There is also no need for manually setting the number of knots. It casts the parameterization and knot placement problems as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem, a generative process automatically determining the number of knots, their placement, parameter values, and their ordering. Once trained, SplineGen demonstrates a notable improvement over existing methods, with a one to two orders of magnitude increase in approximation accuracy on test data.</description>

      <title>Global Crop-Specific Fertilization Dataset from 1961-2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global fertilizer application rates increase, high-quality datasets are paramount for comprehensive analyses to support informed decision-making and policy formulation in crucial areas such as food security or climate change. This study aims to fill existing data gaps by employing two machine learning models, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and HistGradientBoosting algorithms to produce precise country-level predictions of nitrogen ($N$), phosphorus pentoxide ($P_2O_5$), and potassium oxide ($K_2O$) application rates. Subsequently, we created a comprehensive dataset of 5-arcmin resolution maps depicting the application rates of each fertilizer for 13 major crop groups from 1961 to 2019. The predictions were validated by both comparing with existing databases and by assessing the drivers of fertilizer application rates using the model's SHapley Additive exPlanations. This extensive dataset is poised to be a valuable resource for assessing fertilization trends, identifying the socioeconomic, agricultural, and environmental drivers of fertilizer application rates, and serving as an input for various applications, including environmental modeling, causal analysis, fertilizer price predictions, and forecasting.</description>

      <title>LooPIN: A PinFi protocol for decentralized computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked computing power is a critical utility in the era of artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel Physical Infrastructure Finance (PinFi) protocol designed to facilitate the distribution of computing power within networks in a decentralized manner. Addressing the core challenges of coordination, pricing, and liquidity in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), the PinFi protocol introduces a distinctive dynamic pricing mechanism. It enables providers to allocate excess computing resources to a "dissipative" PinFi liquidity pool, distinct from traditional DeFi liquidity pools, ensuring seamless access for clients at equitable, market-based prices. This approach significantly reduces the costs of accessing computing power, potentially to as low as 1% compared to existing services, while simultaneously enhancing security and dependability. The PinFi protocol is poised to transform the dynamics of supply and demand in computing power networks, setting a new standard for efficiency and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Towards Domain Adaptive Neural Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gut Feel: Using Time Series Transformers to Find Investment Gems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the growing application of data-driven approaches within the Private Equity (PE) industry, particularly in sourcing investment targets (i.e., companies) for Venture Capital (VC) and Growth Capital (GC). We present a comprehensive review of the relevant approaches and propose a novel approach leveraging a Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Classifier (TMTSC) for predicting the success likelihood of any candidate company. The objective of our research is to optimize sourcing performance for VC and GC investments by formally defining the sourcing problem as a multivariate time series classification task. We consecutively introduce the key components of our implementation which collectively contribute to the successful application of TMTSC in VC/GC sourcing: input features, model architecture, optimization target, and investor-centric data processing. Our extensive experiments on two real-world investment tasks, benchmarked towards three popular baselines, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving decision making within the VC and GC industry.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-based Prompt Evolution Engineering Design Optimization With Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering design optimization requires an efficient combination of a 3D shape representation, an optimization algorithm, and a design performance evaluation method, which is often computationally expensive. We present a prompt evolution design optimization (PEDO) framework contextualized in a vehicle design scenario that leverages a vision-language model for penalizing impractical car designs synthesized by a generative model. The backbone of our framework is an evolutionary strategy coupled with an optimization objective function that comprises a physics-based solver and a vision-language model for practical or functional guidance in the generated car designs. In the prompt evolutionary search, the optimizer iteratively generates a population of text prompts, which embed user specifications on the aerodynamic performance and visual preferences of the 3D car designs. Then, in addition to the computational fluid dynamics simulations, the pre-trained vision-language model is used to penalize impractical designs and, thus, foster the evolutionary algorithm to seek more viable designs. Our investigations on a car design optimization problem show a wide spread of potential car designs generated at the early phase of the search, which indicates a good diversity of designs in the initial populations, and an increase of over 20\% in the probability of generating practical designs compared to a baseline framework without using a vision-language model. Visual inspection of the designs against the performance results demonstrates prompt evolution as a very promising paradigm for finding novel designs with good optimization performance while providing ease of use in specifying design specifications and preferences via a natural language interface.</description>
