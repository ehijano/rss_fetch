      <title>Incentivizing Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study a principal-agent model in which a principal hires an agent to collect information about an unknown continuous state. The agent acquires a signal whose distribution is centered around the state, controlling the signal's precision at a cost. The principal observes neither the precision nor the signal, but rather, using transfers that can depend on the state, incentivizes the agent to choose high precision and report the signal truthfully. I identify a sufficient and necessary condition on the agent's information structure which ensures that there exists an optimal transfer with a simple cutoff structure: the agent receives a fixed prize when his prediction is close enough to the state and receives nothing otherwise. This condition is mild and applies to all signal distributions commonly used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Peace in the Face of Uncertainty: Resource Allocation with Stochastic Armaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a government's strategic resource allocation choices when facing an opposing group whose military power is uncertain. We investigate how this uncertainty affects the government's decision to divide resources in a way that either guarantees peace, despite unresolved uncertainty, or risks conflict. We find that under low uncertainty, the government prefers distributions which ensure peace, while under high uncertainty, they are willing to risk war. When uncertainty is low, the government's allocation is decreasing in uncertainty. When uncertainty is high it is increasing. The latter leads to an increased probability of fighting and falling total welfare.</description>

      <title>Games under the Tiered Deferred Acceptance Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tiered deferred acceptance mechanism used in school admissions, such as in China and Turkey. This mechanism partitions schools into tiers and applies the deferred acceptance algorithm within each tier. Once assigned, students cannot apply to schools in subsequent tiers. We show that this mechanism is not strategy-proof. In the induced preference revelation game, we find that merging tiers preserves all equilibrium outcomes, and within-tier acyclicity is necessary and sufficient for the mechanism to implement stable matchings. We also find that introducing tiers to the deferred acceptance mechanism may not improve student quality at top-tier schools as intended.</description>
