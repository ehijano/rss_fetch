      <title>The white dwarf binary pathways survey -- X. Gaia orbits for known UV excess binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs with a F, G or K type companion represent the last common ancestor for a plethora of exotic systems throughout the galaxy, though to this point very few of them have been fully characterised in terms of orbital period and component masses, despite the fact several thousand have been identified. Gaia data release 3 has examined many hundreds of thousands of systems, and as such we can use this, in conjunction with our previous UV excess catalogues, to perform spectral energy distribution fitting in order to obtain a sample of 206 binaries likely to contain a white dwarf, complete with orbital periods, and either a direct measurement of the component masses for astrometric systems, or a lower limit on the component masses for spectroscopic systems. Of this sample of 206, four have previously been observed with Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopically in the ultraviolet, which has confirmed the presence of a white dwarf, and we find excellent agreement between the dynamical and spectroscopic masses of the white dwarfs in these systems. We find that white dwarf plus F, G or K binaries can have a wide range of orbital periods, from less than a day to many hundreds of days. A large number of our systems are likely post-stable mass transfer systems based on their mass/period relationships, while others are difficult to explain either via stable mass transfer or standard common envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>Transition to a weaker Sun: Changes in the solar atmosphere during the decay of the Modern Maximum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun experienced a period of unprecedented activity during the 20th century, now called the Modern Maximum (MM). The decay of the MM after cycle 19 has changed the Sun, the heliosphere, and the planetary environments in many ways. However, studies disagree on whether this decay has proceeded synchronously in different solar parameters or not. One key issue is if the relation between two long parameters of solar activity, the sunspot number and the solar 10.7cm radio flux, has remained the same during this decay. A recent study argues that there is an inhomogeneity in the 10.7cm radio flux in 1980, which leads to a step-like jump ("1980 jump") in this relation. Here we show that the relation between sunspot number and 10.7cm radio flux varies in time, not due to an inhomogeneous radio flux but due to physical changes in the solar atmosphere. We used radio fluxes at four different wavelengths measured in Japan, and studied their long-term relation with the sunspot number and the 10.7cm radio flux. We also used two other solar parameters, the MgII index and the number of active regions. We find that the 1980 jump is only the first of a series of 1-2-year "humps" that mainly occur during solar maxima. All radio fluxes increase with respect to the sunspot number from the 1970s to 2010s. These results reestablish the 10.7cm flux as a homogeneous measure of solar activity. The fluxes of the longer radio waves are found to increase with respect to the shorter waves, which suggests a long-term change in the solar radio spectrum. We also find that the MgII index and the number of active regions also increased with respect to the sunspot number, further verifying the difference in the long-term evolution in chromospheric and photospheric parameters. Our results provide evidence for important structural changes in solar magnetic fields and the solar atmosphere during the decay of the MM.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Hunt for Post-Red Supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud I: Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yellow supergiants (YSGs) are rare and poorly understood, and studying them is critical to constraining massive star evolution. We obtained flux-calibrated Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) high-resolution spectra of 40 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); this sample likely contains post-red supergiants (RSGs). Fitting these data with ATLAS9 model atmospheres, we determined fundamental parameters for these stars. We measure the first spectroscopic luminosities for YSGs above 20 $M_\odot$, providing us a novel probe of the luminosity-to-mass ratio. Many stars in our sample appear to have anomalously high surface gravities, despite being confirmed LMC supergiants. We manually inspected our data finding evidence for binary companions and ongoing mass loss. Our work demonstrates the valuable role of high-resolution spectroscopy in interpreting the evolutionary status of cool supergiants.</description>

      <title>Coupling between magnetic reconnection, energy release, and particle acceleration in the X17.2 2003 October 28 solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2003 October 28 (X17.2) eruptive flare was a unique event. The coronal electric field and the {\pi}-decay {\gamma}-ray emission flux had the highest values ever inferred in solar flares. This study reveals physical links between the magnetic reconnection process, the energy release, and the acceleration of electrons and ions to high energies in the chain of the magnetic energy transformations in the impulsive phase of the solar flare. The global reconnection rate and the local reconnection rate are calculated from flare ribbon separation in H{\alpha} filtergrams and photospheric magnetic field maps. Available results of INTEGRAL and CORONAS-F/SONG observations are combined with Konus-Wind data to quantify time behavior of electron and proton acceleration. Prompt {\gamma}-ray lines and delayed 2.2 MeV line temporal profiles observed with Konus-Wind and INTEGRAL/SPI used to detect and quantify the nuclei with energies of 10-70 MeV. The global and local reconnection rates reach their peaks at the end of the main rise phase of the flare. The spectral analysis of the high-energy {\gamma}-ray emission revealed a close association between the acceleration process efficiency and the reconnection rates. High-energy bremsstrahlung continuum and narrow {\gamma}-ray lines were observed in the main rise phase. In the main energy release phase, the upper energy of the bremsstrahlung spectrum was significantly reduced and the pion-decay {\gamma}-ray emission appeared abruptly. We discuss the reasons why the change of the acceleration regime occurred along with the large-scale magnetic field restructuration of this flare. We argue that the main energy release and proton acceleration up to subrelativistic energies began just when the reconnection rate was going through the maximum, i.e., after a major change of the flare topology.</description>

      <title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel$ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5-13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 AU, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1GeV. We find that $\kappa_\parallel$ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in $\kappa_\parallel$ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of $\kappa_{\parallel}=(5.16\pm1.22) \times 10^{18} \: r^{1.17\pm0.08} \: E^{0.71\pm 0.02} \; (cm^2/s)$ in the inner heliosphere which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Probing Depth Variations of Solar Inertial Modes through Normal Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered inertial waves, observed on the solar surface, likely extend to the deeper layers of the Sun. Utilizing helioseismic techniques, we explore these motions, allowing us to discern inertial-mode eigenfunctions in both radial and latitudinal orientations. We analyze $8$ years of space-based observations ($2010 - 2017$) taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar dynamic observatory (SDO) using normal-mode coupling. Coupling between same and different-degree acoustic modes and different frequency bins are measured in order to capture the various length scales of inertial modes. We detect inertial modes at high latitude with azimuthal order $t=1$ and frequency $\sim -80$ nHz. This mode is present in the entire convection zone. The presence of Rossby modes may be seen down to a depth of $\sim 0.83R_\odot$ and the Rossby signal is indistinguishable from noise below that depth for high azimuthal order. We find that the amplitudes of these modes increase with depth down to around $0.92 R_\odot$ and decrease below that depth. We find that the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes deviate from sectoral spherical harmonics if we use a similar approach as adopted in earlier studies. We found that spatial leakage and even pure noise in the measurements of non-sectoral components can also explain the above-mentioned characteristics of the latitudinal eigenfunctions. This realization underscores the necessity for careful interpretation when considering the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes. Exploring the depth-dependent characteristics of these modes will enable us to capture interior dynamics distinctly, separate from p-mode seismology.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of detecting shadows in disks induced by infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations performed with high-resolution imaging techniques revealed the existence of shadows in circumstellar disks that can be explained by the misalignment of an inner with respect to an outer disk. The cause of misalignment, however, is still debated. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of observing shadows induced by one prominent scenario that may lead to misalignment, which involves the late infall of material onto a protostellar system. In particular, we use previously performed hydrodynamical simulations of such events, and generate flux maps in the visible, near-infrared, submillimeter, and millimeter wavelength range using Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Based on that, we derive synthetic observations of these systems performed with the instruments SPHERE/VLT and ALMA, which we use as a basis for our subsequent analysis. We find that near-infrared observations with SPHERE are particularly well suited for detecting shadows via direct imaging alongside other features such as gaps, arcs, and streamers. On the contrary, performing a shadow detection based on reconstructed ALMA observations is very challenging due to the high sensitivity that is required for this task. Thus, in cases that allow for a detection, sophisticated analyses may be needed, for instance by the utilization of carefully constructed azimuthal profiles, aiding the search for potentially shallow shadows. Lastly, we conclude that late infall-induced disk misalignment offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of shadows that are observed in various systems.</description>

      <title>Coriolis darkening in late-type stars II. Effect of self-sustained magnetic fields in stratified convective envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the surface brightness distribution of stars is of prime importance to interpret observations. Nevertheless, this remains quite challenging for cool stars as it requires one to model the MHD turbulence that develops in their convective envelope. In Paper I, the effect of the Coriolis acceleration on the surface heat flux has been studied by means of hydrodynamic simulations. In this paper, we aim to investigate the additional effect of dynamo magnetic fields. We focus on an envelope thickness that is representative of either a $\sim0.35~M_\odot$ M dwarf, a young red giant star or a pre-main sequence star. We performed a parametric study using numerical MHD simulations of anelastic convection in thick rotating spherical shells. For each model, we computed the mean surface distribution of the heat flux, and examined the leading-order effect of the magnetic field on the obtained latitudinal luminosity profile. We identify three different regimes. Close to the onset of convection, while the first unstable modes tend to convey heat more efficiently near the equator, magnetic fields are shown to generally enhance the mean heat flux close to the polar regions (and the tangent cylinder). By progressively increasing the Rayleigh number, the development of a prograde equatorial jet was previously shown to make the equator darker when no magnetic field is taken into account. For moderate Rayleigh numbers, magnetic fields can instead inverse the mean pole-equator brightness contrast (which means going from a darker to a brighter equator when a dynamo sets in) and finally induce a similar regime to that found close to the onset of convection. For more turbulent models with larger Rayleigh numbers, magnetic fields alternatively tend to smooth out the brightness contrast. This general behavior is shown to be related to the quenching of the surface differential rotation by magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Metallicities for more than 10 million stars derived from Gaia BP/RP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The third Gaia Data Release, which includes BP/RP spectra for 219 million sources, has opened a new window in the exploration of the chemical history and evolution of the Milky Way. The wealth of information encapsulated in these data is far greater than their low resolving power (R=50) at first glance would suggest, as shown in many studies. We zero in on the use of this data for the purpose of the detection of ''new'' metal-poor stars, which are hard to find yet essential for understanding - among other - several aspects of the origin of the Galaxy, star formation and the creation of the elements. Aims. We strive to refine a metal-poor candidate selection method which was developed with simulated Gaia BP/RP spectra, with an ultimate objective of providing the community with both a recipe to select stars for medium/high resolution observations and a catalogue of stellar metallicities. Methods. We used a datased comprised of GALAH DR3 and SAGA database stars in order to verify and adjust to real world data our selection method. For that purpose, we used dereddening as a mean to tackle the issue of extinction, and then we applied our fine-tuned method to select metal-poor candidates, which we thereafter observed and analysed. Results. We were able to infer metallicities for GALAH DR3 and SAGA stars - with color excesses up to E(B-V)&lt;1.5 - with an uncertainty of 0.36 dex, which is good enough for the purpose of identifying new metal-poor stars. Further, we selected 26 metal-poor candidates - via our method - for observations. As spectral analysis showed, 100% of them had [Fe/H]&lt;-2.0, 57% had [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 and 8% had [Fe/H]&lt;-3.0. We inferred metallicities for these stars with an uncertainty of 0.31 dex, as was proven when comparing to the spectroscopic [Fe/H]. Finally, we assembled a catalogue of metallicities for 10 861 062 stars.</description>

      <title>Semantic Segmentation of Solar Radio Spikes at Low Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar radio spikes are short lived, narrow bandwidth features in low frequency solar radio observations. The timing of their occurrence and the number of spikes in a given observation is often unpredictable. The high temporal and frequency of resolution of modern radio telescopes such as NenuFAR mean that manually identifying radio spikes is an arduous task. Machine learning approaches to data exploration in solar radio data is on the rise. Here we describe a convolutional neural network to identify the per pixel location of radio spikes as well as determine some simple characteristics of duration, spectral width and drift rate. The model, which we call SpikeNet, was trained using an Nvidia Tesla T4 16GB GPU with ~100000 sample spikes in a total time of 2.2 hours. The segmentation performs well with an intersection over union in the test set of ~0.85. The root mean squared error for predicted spike properties is of the order of 23%. Applying the algorithm to unlabelled data successfully generates segmentation masks although the accuracy of the predicted properties is less reliable, particularly when more than one spike is present in the same 64 X 64 pixel time-frequency range. We have successfully demonstrated that our convolutional neural network can locate and characterise solar radio spikes in a number of seconds compared to the weeks it would take for manual identification.</description>

      <title>Long-term monitoring of large-scale magnetic fields across optical and near-infrared domains with ESPaDOnS, Narval and SPIRou. The cases of EV Lac, DS Leo, and CN Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamo models of stellar magnetic fields for partly and fully convective stars are guided by observational constraints. Zeeman-Doppler imaging has revealed a variety of magnetic field geometries and, for fully convective stars in particular, a dichotomy: either strong, mostly axisymmetric, and dipole-dominated or weak, non-axisymmetric, and multipole-dominated. This dichotomy is explained by dynamo bistability or by long-term magnetic cycles, but there is no definite conclusion on the matter. We analysed optical spectropolarimetric data sets collected with ESPaDOnS and Narval between 2005 and 2016, and near-infrared SPIRou data obtained between 2019 and 2022 for three active M dwarfs with masses between 0.1 and 0.6 MSun: EV Lac, DS Leo, and CN Leo. We looked for changes in time series of longitudinal magnetic field, width of unpolarised mean-line profiles, and large-scale field topology as retrieved with principal component analysis and Zeeman-Doppler imaging. We retrieved pulsating (EV Lac), stable (DS Leo), and sine-like (CN Leo) long-term trends in longitudinal field. The width of near-infrared mean-line profiles exhibits rotational modulation only for DS Leo, whereas in the optical it is evident for both EV Lac and DS Leo. The line width variations are not necessarily correlated to those of the longitudinal field, suggesting complex relations between small- and large-scale field. We also recorded topological changes: a reduced axisymmetry for EV Lac and a transition from toroidal- to poloidal-dominated regime for DS Leo. For CN Leo, the topology remained dipolar and axisymmetric, with only an oscillation in field strength. Our results show a peculiar evolution of the magnetic field for each M dwarf, confirming that M dwarfs with distinct masses and rotation periods can undergo magnetic long-term variations, and suggesting a variety of cyclic behaviours of their magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>The Enigma of Gaia18cjb: a Rare Hybrid of Four and EXor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Gaia18cjb is one of the Gaia-alerted eruptive young star candidates which has been experiencing a slow and strong brightening during the last 13 years, similar to some FU Orionis-type objects. Aims. The aim of this work is to derive the young stellar nature of Gaia18cjb, determine its physical and accretion properties to classify its variability. Methods. We conducted monitoring observations using multi-filter optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy. We present the analysis of pre-outburst and outburst optical and infrared light curves, color-magnitude diagrams in different bands, the detection of near-IR spectral lines, and estimates of both stellar and accretion parameters during the burst. Results. The optical light curve shows an unusually long (8 years) brightening event of 5 mag in the last 13 years, before reaching a plateau indicating that the burst is still on-going, suggesting a FUor-like nature. The same outburst is less strong in the infrared light curves. The near-infrared spectra, obtained during the outburst, exhibit emission lines typical of highly accreting low-intermediate mass young stars with typical EXor features. The spectral index of Gaia18cjb SED classifies it as a Class I in the pre-burst stage and a Flat Spectrum young stellar object (YSO) during the burst. Conclusions. Gaia18cjb is an eruptive YSO which shows FUor-like photometric features (in terms of brightening amplitude and length of the burst) and EXor-like spectroscopic features and accretion rate, as V350 Cep and V1647 Ori, classified as objects in between FUors and EXors</description>

      <title>Latest Evolution of the X-Ray Remnant of SN 1987A: Beyond the Inner Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07990</link>

Abstract: Based on our Chandra imaging-spectroscopic observations, we present the latest evolution of the X-ray remnant of SN 1987A. Recent changes in the electron temperatures and volume emission measures suggest that the blast wave in SN 1987A is moving out of the dense inner ring structure, also called the equatorial ring (ER). The 0.5-2.0 keV X-ray light curve shows a linearly declining trend (by $\sim$4.5 % yr$^{-1}$) between 2016 and 2020, as the blast wave heats the hitherto unknown circumstellar medium (CSM) outside the ER. While the peak X-ray emission in the latest 0.3-8.0 keV image is still within the ER, the radial expansion rate in the 3.0-8.0 keV images suggests an increasing contribution of the X-ray emission from less dense CSM since 2012, at least partly from beyond the ER. It is remarkable that, since 2020, the declining soft X-ray flux has stabilized around $\sim$7 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which may signal a contribution from the reverse-shocked outer layers of ejecta as predicted by the 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models. In the latest ACIS spectrum of supernova remnant (SNR) 1987A in 2022 we report a significant detection of the Fe K line at $\sim$6.7 keV, which may be due to changing thermal conditions of the X-ray emitting CSM and/or the onset of reverse shock interactions with the Fe-ejecta.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Properties of Molecular Gas Toward the Monoceros OB1 Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the MWISP survey at an angular resolution of about $50''$. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, shows that molecular gas in the $\rm 8^{\circ}\times4^{\circ}$ region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ data, a total of 263 $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures are identified in the whole region, and 88\% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of $\rm 729^{+45}_{-45}~pc$ for the GMC complex. The total mass of the GMC Complex traced by $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ are $1.1\times10^5~M_\odot$, $4.3\times10^4~M_\odot$, and $8.4\times10^3~M_\odot$, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4\%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3\%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (e.g., greater velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, and more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.</description>

      <title>The intermittently-resonant coevolution of migrating planets and their pulsating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are expected to form far from their host star and move toward close-in, circular orbits via a smooth, monotonic decay due to mild and constant tidal dissipation. Yet, three systems have recently been found exhibiting planet-induced stellar pulsations suggesting unexpectedly strong tidal interactions. Here we combine stellar evolution and tide models to show that dynamical tides raised by eccentric gas giants can give rise to chains of resonance locks with multiple modes, enriching the dynamics seen in single-mode resonance locking of circularized systems. These series of resonance locks yield orders-of-magnitude larger changes in eccentricity and harmonic pulsations relative to those expected from a single episode of resonance locking or nonresonant tidal interactions. Resonances become more frequent as a star evolves off the main sequence providing an alternative explanation to the origin of some stellar pulsators and yielding the concept of "dormant migrating giants". Evolution trajectories are characterized by competing episodes of inward/outward migration and spin-up/-down of the star which are sensitive to the system parameters, revealing a new challenge in modeling migration paths and in contextualizing the observed populations of giant exoplanets and stellar binaries. This sensitivity however offers a new window to constrain the stellar properties of planetary hosts via tidal asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Chemical Cartography with APOGEE: Two-process Parameters and Residual Abundances for 288,789 Stars from Data Release 17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar abundance measurements are subject to systematic errors that induce extra scatter and artificial correlations in elemental abundance patterns. We derive empirical calibration offsets to remove systematic trends with surface gravity $\log(g)$ in 17 elemental abundances of 288,789 evolved stars from the SDSS APOGEE survey. We fit these corrected abundances as the sum of a prompt process tracing core-collapse supernovae and a delayed process tracing Type Ia supernovae, thus recasting each star's measurements into the amplitudes $A_{\text{cc}}$ and $A_{\text{Ia}}$ and the element-by-element residuals from this two-parameter fit. As a first application of this catalog, which is $8\times$ larger than that of previous analyses that used a restricted $\log(g)$ range, we examine the median residual abundances of 14 open clusters, nine globular clusters, and four dwarf satellite galaxies. Relative to field Milky Way disk stars, the open clusters younger than 2 Gyr show $\approx 0.1-0.2$ dex enhancements of the neutron-capture element Ce, and the two clusters younger than 0.5 Gyr also show elevated levels of C+N, Na, S, and Cu. Globular clusters show elevated median abundances of C+N, Na, Al, and Ce, and correlated abundance residuals that follow previously known trends. The four dwarf satellites show similar residual abundance patterns despite their different star formation histories, with $\approx 0.2-0.3$ dex depletions in C+N, Na, and Al and $\approx 0.1$ dex depletions in Ni, V, Mn, and Co. We provide our catalog of corrected APOGEE abundances, two-process amplitudes, and residual abundances, which will be valuable for future studies of abundance patterns in different stellar populations and of additional enrichment processes that affect galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE). I. Early ALMA Survey: observations and massive data reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) Recent molecular surveys have revealed a rich gas organization of sonic-like fibers in all kind of environments prior to the formation of low- and high-mass stars. This paper introduces the EMERGE project aiming to investigate whether complex fiber arrangements could explain the origin of high-mass stars and clusters. We analyzed the EMERGE Early ALMA Survey including 7 star-forming regions in Orion (OMC-1/2/3/4 South, L1641N, NGC2023, and Flame Nebula) homogeneously surveyed in both molecular lines (N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, HNC J=1-0, plus HC3N J=10-9) and 3mm-continuum using a combination of interferometric ALMA mosaics and IRAM-30m single-dish (SD) maps. Based on our low-resolution (SD) observations, we describe the global properties of our sample covering a wide range of physical conditions including low-, intermediate, and high-mass star-forming regions in different evolutionary stages. Their comparison with ancillary YSO catalogs denotes N$_2$H$^+$ as the best proxy for the dense, star-forming gas in our targets showing a constant star formation efficiency and a fast time evolution of &lt;1 Myr. While apparently clumpy and filamentary in our SD data, all targets show a much more complex fibrous substructure at the enhanced resolution of our ALMA+IRAM-30m maps. A large number of filamentary features at sub-parsec scales are clearly recognized in the high-density gas traced by N$_2$H$^+$ directly connected to the formation of individual protostars. This complex gas organization appears to extend further into the more diffuse gas traced by HNC. This paper presents the EMERGE Early ALMA survey including a first data release of continuum maps and spectral products for this project to be analysed in future papers of this series. A first look at these results illustrates the need of advanced data combination techniques to investigate the intrinsic multi-scale, gas structure of the ISM.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: an ultra-stripped, nickel-poor supernova from a low-mass progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $&lt;$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($&lt; 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.</description>

      <title>Effects of wave damping and finite perpendicular scale on three-dimensional Alfv\'en wave parametric decay in low-beta plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear Alfven wave parametric decay instability (PDI) provides a potential path toward significant wave dissipation and plasma heating. However, fundamental questions regarding how PDI is excited in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) open system and how critically the finite perpendicular wave scale -- as found in both the laboratory and space plasmas -- affects the excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first 3D, open-boundary, hybrid kinetic-fluid simulations of kinetic Alfven wave PDI in low-beta plasmas. Key findings are that the PDI excitation is strongly limited by the wave damping present, including electron-ion collisional damping (represented by a constant resistivity) and geometrical attenuation associated with the finite-scale Alfven wave, and ion Landau damping of the child acoustic wave. The perpendicular wave scale alone, however, plays no discernible role, with different wave scales exhibiting similar instability growth. These findings are corroborated by theoretical analysis and estimates. The new understanding of 3D kinetic Alfven wave PDI physics is essential for laboratory study of the basic plasma process and may also help evaluate the relevance/role of PDI in low-beta space plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the most ancient branch of astronomy, astrometry has been developed for thousands of years. However, it has only recently become possible to utilize astrometry for the detection of exoplanets. Gaia, an astrometric surveyor of 1 billion stars, is capable of measuring the position of stars with a precision as high as 20 $\mu$as. Gaia is expected to discover more than 10,000 exoplanets by the end of its mission, surpassing the productivity of most exoplanet surveys.
  In this chapter, I will introduce different techniques used to achieve high-precision astrometry. Subsequently, I will explore how both relative and absolute astrometry can be employed to detect exoplanets. Finally, I will present the detection limit of the Gaia astrometric survey.</description>

      <title>Excited-State OH Masers in the Water Fountain Source IRAS 18460-0151</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water fountain objects are generally defined as "evolved stars with low to intermediate initial mass accompanied by high-velocity molecular jets detectable in the 22.235 GHz H$_2$O maser line". They are the key objects of understanding the morphological transitions of circumstellar envelopes during the post asymptotic giant branch phase. Masers are useful tools to trace the kinematic environments of the circumstellar envelopes. In this letter we report the discovery of exceptionally uncommon excited-state hydroxyl (ex-OH) masers at 4660 and 6031 MHz toward the water fountain source IRAS 18460-0151. These are the brightest ex-OH masers discovered in late-type objects to date. To the best of our knowledge, prior to the current work, no evolved stellar object has been observed in the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line. The ground-state hydroxyl (g-OH) masers at 1612 and 1665 MHz are also observed. The velocity components of the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line and the much weaker 1665 MHz g-OH maser line all can be seen in the 1612 MHz g-OH maser line profile. The blue-shifted components of the three masers are more intense than the red-shifted ones, in contrast to the ex-OH maser line at 6031 MHz. The relevance of the behaviors of the ex-OH masers to the circumstellar environments is unclear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a study of the equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic stars in the framework of general relativity. For that purpose, we provide the equations of structure where the rotation is treated to second order in the angular velocity. These equations extend those first derived by Hartle for slowly rotating isotropic stars. As an application of the new formalism, we study the rotational properties of Bowers-Liang fluid spheres. A result of particular interest is that the ellipticity and mass quadrupole moment are negative for certain highly anisotropic configurations, thus such systems are prolate rather than oblate. Furthermore, for configurations with high anisotropy, and compactness close to their critical value, quantities like the moment of inertia, change of mass, and mass quadrupole moment approach to the corresponding Kerr black hole values, similar to other ultracompact systems like sub-Buchdahl Schwarzschild stars and analytic rotating gravastars.</description>

Abstract: The Cryogenic IR echelle Spectrometer (CRIRES) instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) was in operation from 2006 to 2014. Great strides in characterizing the inner regions of protoplanetary disks were made using CRIRES observations in the L- and M-band at this time. The upgraded instrument, CRIRES+, became available in 2021 and covers a larger wavelength range simultaneously. Here we present new CRIRES+ Science Verification data of the binary system S Coronae Australis (S CrA). We aim to characterize the upgraded CRIRES+ instrument for disk studies and provide new insight into the gas in the inner disk of the S CrA N and S systems. We analyze the CRIRES+ data taken in all available L- and M-band settings, providing spectral coverage from 2.9 to 5.5 $\mu$m. We detect emission from $^{12}$CO (v=1-0, v=2-1, and v=3-2), $^{13}$CO (v=1-0), hydrogen recombination lines, OH, and H$_2$O in the S CrA N disk. In the fainter S CrA S system, only the $^{12}$CO v=1-0 and the hydrogen recombination lines are detected. The $^{12}$CO v=1-0 emission in S CrA N and S shows two velocity components, a broad component coming from $\sim$0.1 au in S CrA N and $\sim$0.03 au in S CrA S and a narrow component coming from $\sim$3 au in S CrA N and $\sim$5 au in S CrA S. We fit local thermodynamic equilibrium slab models to the rotation diagrams of the two S CrA N velocity components and find that they have similar column densities ($\sim$1-7$\times$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$), but that the broad component is coming from a hotter and narrower region. Two filter settings, M4211 and M4368, provide sufficient wavelength coverage for characterizing CO and H$_2$O at $\sim$5 $\mu$m, in particular covering low- and high-$J$ lines. CRIRES+ provides spectral coverage and resolution that are crucial complements to low-resolution observations, such as those with JWST, where multiple velocity components cannot be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Outflows Driven from a Magnetic Pseudodisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflows play a pivotal role in star formation as one of its most visible markers and a means of transporting mass, momentum, and angular momentum from the infalling gas into the surrounding molecular cloud. Their wide reach (at least thousands of au) is a contrast to typical disk sizes ($\sim 10-100$ au). We employ high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study outflow properties in the Class 0 phase. We find that no disk wind is driven from the extended centrifugal disk that has weak magnetic coupling. The low-velocity winds emerge instead from the infalling magnetic pseudodisk. Much of the disk actually experiences an infall of matter rather than outflowing gas. Some of the pseudodisk wind (PD-wind) moves inward to regions above the disk and either falls onto the disk or proceeds upward. The upward flow gives the impression of a disk wind above a certain height even if the gas is originally emerging from the pseudodisk. The PD-wind has the strongest flow coming from a disk interaction zone that lies just outside the disk and is an interface between the inwardly advected magnetic field of the pseudodisk and the outwardly diffusing magnetic field of the disk. The low-velocity wind exhibits the features of a flow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force in some regions and those of a magnetocentrifugal wind in other regions. We interpret the structure and dynamics of the outflow zone in terms of the basic physics of gravity, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and nonideal MHD.</description>

Abstract: Previous studies have found that red giants (RGs) in close binary systems undergoing spin-orbit resonance exhibit an enhanced level of magnetic activity with respect to single RGs rotating at the same rate, from measurements of photometric variability $S'_{ph}$ and chromospheric emission S-index $S_{Ca_{II}}$. Here, we consider a sample of 4465 RGs observed by the NASA Kepler mission to measure additional activity indicators that probe different heights in the chromosphere: the near-ultraviolet (NUV) excess from NASA GALEX photometric data, and chromospheric indices based on the depth of H$\alpha$, Mg$_{I}$ and infared Ca$_{II}$ absorption lines from LAMOST spectroscopic data. Firstly, as for Ca$_{II}$ H&amp;K, we observe that RGs belonging to close binaries in a state of spin-orbit resonance display larger chromospheric emission than the cohort of RGs, as illustrated by an NUV excess and shallower H$\alpha$ and infrared Ca$_{II}$ lines. We report no excess of Mg$_{I}$ emission. This result reinforces previous claims that tidal locking leads to enhanced magnetic fields, and allows us to provide criteria to classify active red giants -- single or binary --, based on their rotation periods and magnetic activity indices. Secondly, we strikingly observe that the depths of the Mg$_{I}$ and H$\alpha$ lines are anti-correlated and correlated, respectively, with the amplitude of solar-like oscillations for a given surface gravity $\log g$, regardless of the presence of photometric rotational modulation. Such a correlation opens up future possibilities of estimating the value of magnetic fields at the surface of RG stars, whether quiet or active, by combining spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements with three-dimensional atmospheric models including radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Chain Chemistry in the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15769v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of carbon-chain molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) has been known since the early 1970s and $&gt;130$ such species have been identified to date, making up $\sim 43$% of the total of detected ISM molecules. They are prevalent not only in star-forming regions in our Galaxy but also in other galaxies. These molecules provide important information on physical conditions, gas dynamics, and evolutionary stages of star-forming regions. Larger species of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fullerenes (C$_{60}$ and C$_{70}$), which may be related to the formation of the carbon-chain molecules, have been detected in circumstellar envelopes around carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and planetary nebulae, while PAHs are also known to be a widespread component of the ISM in most galaxies. Recently, two line survey projects toward Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 with large single-dish telescopes have detected many new carbon-chain species, including molecules containing benzene rings. These new findings raise fresh questions about carbon-bearing species in the Universe. This article reviews various aspects of carbon-chain molecules, including observational studies, chemical simulations, quantum calculations, and laboratory experiments, and discusses open questions and how future facilities may answer them.</description>

      <title>Long-rising Type II Supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 1987A was an unusual hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova originating from a blue supergiant star. Similar blue supergiant explosions remain a small family of events, and are broadly characterized by their long rises to peak. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment aims to construct a spectroscopically complete sample of transients occurring in galaxies from the CLU galaxy catalog. We identify 13 long-rising (&gt;40 days) Type II supernovae from the volume-limited CLU experiment during a 3.5 year period from June 2018 to December 2021, approximately doubling the previously known number of these events. We present photometric and spectroscopic data of these 13 events, finding peak r-band absolute magnitudes ranging from -15.6 to -17.5 mag and the tentative detection of Ba II lines in 9 events. Using our CLU sample of events, we derive a long-rising Type II supernova rate of $1.37^{+0.26}_{-0.30}\times10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, $\approx$1.4% of the total core-collapse supernova rate. This is the first volumetric rate of these events estimated from a large, systematic, volume-limited experiment.</description>

      <title>Effects of Grain Magnetic Properties and Grain Growth on Synthetic Dust Polarization of MHD Simulations in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal dust polarization is a powerful tool to probe magnetic fields ($\textbf{B}$) and grain properties. However, a systematic study of the dependence of dust polarization on grain properties in protostellar environments is not yet available. In this paper, we post-process a non-ideal MHD simulation of a collapsing protostellar core with our updated POLARIS code to study in detail the effects of iron inclusions and grain growth on thermal dust polarization. We found that superparamagnetic (SPM) grains can produce high polarization degree of $p \sim 10-40\%$ beyond $\sim 500$ au from the protostar because of their efficient alignment by magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque mechanism. The magnetic field tangling by turbulence in the envelope causes the decrease in $p$ with increasing emission intensity $I$ as $p\propto I^{\alpha}$ with the slope $\alpha \sim -0.3$. But within 500 au, SPM grains tend to have inefficient internal alignment (IA) and be aligned with $\textbf{B}$ by RATs only, producing lower $p \sim 1\%$ and a steeper slope of $\alpha \sim -0.6$. For paramagnetic (PM) grains, the alignment loss of grains above $1\mu m$ in the inner $\sim 200$ au produces $p &lt;&lt; 1\%$ and the polarization hole with $\alpha \sim -0.9$. Grain growth can increase $p$ in the envelope for SPM grains, but cause stronger depolarization for SPM grains in the inner $\sim 500$ au and for PM grains in the entire protostellar core. Finally, we found the increase of polarization angle dispersion function $S$ with iron inclusions and grain growth, implying the dependence of B-field strength measured using the DCF technique on grain alignment and grain properties.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Simulations of Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova to Integration Methodology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions in simulations of the double detonation model for Type Ia supernovae. When assessing the convergence of simulations, the focus is usually on spatial resolution; however, the method of coupling the physics together as well as the tolerances used in integrating a reaction network also play an important role. In this paper, we explore how the choices made in both coupling and integrating the reaction portion of a simulation (operator / Strang splitting vs.\ the simplified spectral deferred corrections method we introduced previously) influences the accuracy, efficiency, and the nucleosynthesis of simulations of double detonations. We find no need to limit reaction rates or reduce the simulation timestep to the reaction timescale. The entire simulation methodology used here is GPU-accelerated and made freely available as part of the Castro simulation code.</description>

      <title>Non-Singular Gravitational Collapse through Modified Heisenberg Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of cut-off physics, in the form of a modified algebra inspired by Polymer Quantum Mechanics and by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle representation, on the collapse of a spherical dust cloud. We analyze both the Newtonian formulation, originally developed by Hunter, and the general relativistic formulation, that is the Oppenheimer-Snyder model; in both frameworks we find that the collapse is stabilized to an asymptotically static state above the horizon, and the singularity is removed. In the Newtonian case, by requiring the Newtonian approximation to be valid, we find lower bounds of the order of unity (in Planck units) for the deformation parameter of the modified algebra. We then study the behaviour of small perturbations on the non-singular collapsing backgrounds, and find that for certain range of the parameters (the polytropic index for the Newtonian case and the sound velocity in the relativistic setting) the collapse is stable to perturbations of all scales, and the non-singular super-Schwarzschild configurations have physical meaning.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE: Resolving the End of Star Formation and Structure of AGN Accretion Disks from Cosmological Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently become possible to zoom-in from cosmological to sub-pc scales in galaxy simulations to follow accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, at some point the approximations used on ISM scales (e.g. optically-thin cooling and stellar-population-integrated star formation [SF] and feedback [FB]) break down. We therefore present the first cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation which self-consistently combines the FIRE physics (relevant on galactic/ISM scales where SF/FB are ensemble-averaged) and STARFORGE physics (relevant on small scales where we track individual (proto)stellar formation and evolution), together with explicit RMHD (including non-ideal MHD and multi-band M1-RHD) which self-consistently treats both optically-thick and thin regimes. This allows us to span scales from ~100 Mpc down to &lt;100 au (~300 Schwarzschild radii) around a SMBH at a time where it accretes as a bright quasar, in a single simulation. We show that accretion rates up to $\sim 10-100\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ can be sustained into the accretion disk at $\ll 10^{3}\,R_{\rm schw}$, with gravitational torques between stars and gas dominating on sub-kpc scales until star formation is shut down on sub-pc scales by a combination of optical depth to cooling and strong magnetic fields. There is an intermediate-scale, flux-frozen disk which is gravitoturbulent and stabilized by magnetic pressure sustaining strong turbulence and inflow with persistent spiral modes. In this paper we focus on how gas gets into the small-scale disk, and how star formation is efficiently suppressed.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of wide Jupiter Mass Binary Objects in young stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently observed population of 540 free-floating Jupiter-mass objects, including 40 dynamically soft pairs in the Trapezium cluster have raised interesting questions on their formation and evolution. We test various scenarios for the origin and survivability of these free floating Jupiter-mass objects and Jupiter-mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) in the Trapezium cluster. The numerical calculations are performed by direct N-body integration of the stars and planets in the Trapezium cluster starting with a wide variety of planets in various configurations. We discuss four models: SPP, in which selected stars have two outer orbiting Jupiter-mass planets; SPM, where selected stars are orbited by Jupiter-mass planet-moon pairs; ISF in which JuMBOs form in situ with the stars, and FFC, where we introduce a population of free-floating single Jupiter-mass objects, but no initialized binaries. Models FFC and SPP fail to produce enough JuMBOs. Models SPM can produce sufficient JuMBOs, but requires unusually wide orbits for the planet-moon system around the star. The observed JuMBOs and free-floating Jupiter-mass objects in the Trapezium cluster are best reproduced if they formed in pairs and as free-floaters together with the other stars in a smooth (Plummer) density profile with a virial radius of 0.5pc. A fractal stellar distribution also works, but requires relatively recent formations (&gt;0.2Myr after the other stars formed) or a high (50%) initial binary fraction. This would make the primordial binary fraction of JuMBOs even higher than the already large observation fraction of 8%. The fraction of JuMBOs will continue to drop with time, and the lack of JuMBOs in Upper Scorpius could then result in its higher age, causing more JuMBOs to be ionized. We then also predict that the interstellar density of Jupiter-mass objects (mostly singles with 2% lucky surviving binaries) is 0.05/pc$^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Physical Correlations and Predictions Emerging from Modern Core-Collapse Supernova Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive correlations between core-collapse supernova observables and progenitor core structures that emerge from our suite of twenty state-of-the-art 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times. This is the largest such collection of 3D supernova models ever generated and allows one to witness and derive testable patterns that might otherwise be obscured when studying one or a few models in isolation. From this panoramic perspective, we have discovered correlations between explosion energy, neutron star gravitational birth masses, $^{56}$Ni and $\alpha$-rich freeze-out yields, and pulsar kicks and theoretically important correlations with the compactness parameter of progenitor structure. We find a correlation between explosion energy and progenitor mantle binding energy, suggesting that such explosions are self-regulating. We also find a testable correlation between explosion energy and measures of explosion asymmetry, such as the ejecta energy and mass dipoles. While the correlations between two observables are roughly independent of the progenitor ZAMS mass, the many correlations we derive with compactness can not unambiguously be tied to a particular progenitor ZAMS mass. This relationship depends upon the compactness/ZAMS mass mapping associated with the massive star progenitor models employed. Therefore, our derived correlations between compactness and observables may be more robust than with ZAMS mass, but can nevertheless be used in the future once massive star modeling has converged.</description>

      <title>Analytic model and MHD simulations of three-dimensional magnetic switchbacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe observations reveal that the near-Sun space is almost filled with magnetic switchbacks (``switchbacks'' hereinafter), which may be a major contributor to the heating and acceleration of solar wind. Here, for the first time, we develop an analytic model of an axisymmetric switchback with uniform magnetic field strength. In this model, three parameters control the geometry of the switchback: height (length along the background magnetic field), width (thickness along radial direction perpendicular to the background field), and the radial distance from the center of switchback to the central axis, which is a proxy of the size of the switchback along the third dimension. We carry out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the dynamic evolution of the switchback. Comparing simulations conducted with compressible and incompressible codes, we verify that compressibility, i.e. parametric decay instability, is necessary for destabilizing the switchback. Our simulations also reveal that the geometry of the switchback significantly affects how fast the switchback destabilizes. The most stable switchbacks are 2D-like (planar) structures with large aspect ratios (length to width), consistent with the observations. We show that when plasma beta ($\beta$) is smaller than one, the switchback is more stable as $\beta$ increases. However, when $\beta$ is greater than one, the switchback becomes very unstable as the pattern of the growing compressive fluctuations changes. Our results may explain some of the observational features of switchbacks, including the large aspect ratios and nearly constant occurrence rates in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Where do they come from? Identification of globular cluster escaped stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs), as old as our Galaxy, constantly lose their members to the field as they cross through the Milky Way (MW). These GC escaped stars (or escapees) are suggested to contribute significantly to the MW halo. If a star has left the host GC a long time ago, chemical finger prints, e.g., N enrichment, may reveal its origin. In this work, we aim to establish dynamical connections between N-rich field stars recently identified by LAMOST and the existing MW GCs. By constructing the full action distribution, and combining with metallicity, we found 29 potential GC progenitors for 15 N-rich field stars. Particularly, some of them may be related to MW accretion events. On the other hand, if a star recently left its host GC via tidal evaporation, it still maintain the kinematic properties of the cluster. Here we identify extra-tidal candidates based on their spatial locations, proper motions (PMs), and their position on color-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs). We successfully identified more than 1600 extra-tidal candidates in the vicinity of six Gaia-Enceladus (GE)-related GCs (i.e., NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 6205, NGC 6341, NGC 6779, NGC 7089). The density map of the extra-tidal candidates is confirmed to be an efficient way to find extra-tidal structures. The possible two density peaks at opposite directions of the inner boundary is a good indicator for long stellar stream. Among 95 extra-tidal candidates with spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicity, 54 of them are confirmed to be GC escaped stars, as they share similar properties as host GCs. These extra-tidal candidates are ideal targets for follow-up spectroscopic observation, as it greatly improves the scientific outcome. Once statistically significant number of spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicities are available, the GC dynamical evolution (e.g., mass loss, rotation) can be carefully investigated.</description>
