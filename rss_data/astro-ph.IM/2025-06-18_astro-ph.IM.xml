      <title>Beyond diagonal approximations: improved covariance modeling for pulsar timing array data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope I. Calibration improvements and a comprehensive synthetic data library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) In a series of publications, we describe a comprehensive comparison of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data with theoretical models of Sgr A* and M87*. Here, we report on improvements made to our observational data reduction pipeline and present the generation of observables derived from the EHT models. We make use of ray-traced GRMHD simulations that are based on different black hole spacetime metrics and accretion physics parameters. These broad classes of models provide a good representation of the primary targets observed by the EHT. To generate realistic synthetic data from our models, we took the signal path as well as the calibration process, and thereby the aforementioned improvements, into account. We could thus produce synthetic visibilities akin to calibrated EHT data and identify salient features for the discrimination of model parameters. We have produced a library consisting of an unparalleled 962,000 synthetic Sgr A* and M87* datasets. In terms of baseline coverage and noise properties, the library encompasses 2017 EHT measurements as well as future observations with an extended telescope array. We differentiate between robust visibility data products related to model features and data products that are strongly affected by data corruption effects. Parameter inference is mostly limited by intrinsic model variability, which highlights the importance of long-term monitoring observations with the EHT. In later papers in this series, we will show how a Bayesian neural network trained on our synthetic data is capable of dealing with the model variability and extracting physical parameters from EHT observations. With our calibration improvements, our newly reduced EHT datasets have a considerably better quality compared to previously analyzed data.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope II. The Zingularity framework for Bayesian artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) In this second paper in our publication series, we present the open-source Zingularity framework for parameter inference with deep Bayesian artificial neural networks. We carried out out supervised learning with synthetic millimeter very long baseline interferometry observations of the EHT. Our ground-truth models are based on GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87* on horizon scales. We investigated how well Zingularity neural networks are able to infer key model parameters from EHT observations, such as the black hole spin and the magnetic state of the accretion disk, when uncertainties in the data are accurately taken into account. Zingularity makes use of the TensorFlow Probability library and is able to handle large amounts of data with a combination of the efficient TFRecord data format plus the Horovod framework. Our approach is the first analysis of EHT data with Bayesian neural networks, where an unprecedented training data size, under consideration of a closely modeled EHT signal path, and the full information content of the observational data are used. Zingularity infers parameters based on salient features in the data and is containerized. Through parameter surveys and dedicated validation tests, we identified neural network architectures, that are robust against internal stochastic processes and unaffected by noise in the observational and model data. We give examples of how different data properties affect the network training. We show how the Bayesian nature of our networks gives trustworthy uncertainties and uncovers failure modes for uncharacterizable data. It is easy to achieve low validation errors during training on synthetic data with neural networks, particularly when the forward modeling is too simplified. Through careful studies, we demonstrate that our trained networks can generalize well so that reliable results can be obtained from observational data.</description>

      <title>On the Size of the Mission Suite Enabled by NASA's Deep Space Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is the primary means of commanding, tracking, and receiving data from all of NASA's deep space missions, as well as a number of deep space missions operated by other international space agencies. The current number of missions enabled by the DSN is approximately 40 missions, but there has been concern about the level of "over-subscription" of the DSN, namely that the number of missions currently using the DSN is larger than can be enabled reasonably. This manuscript assesses the maximum number of missions that could be enabled, based on recent performance and with the constraint that the total number of hours used per week does not exceed the available number of DSN antenna-hours. Three different models are considered, and the maximal number of missions that could be enabled ranges between approximately 40 missions and 70 missions, assuming that there continues to be approximately six Mars missions and that those Mars missions continue to make use of the DSN's multiple spacecraft per antenna (MSPA) capability. Crucially, the conclusion that an approximately 50% growth in the DSN mission suite rests on the assumption that the DSN antennas are "interchangeable," but they are not, with some spacecraft able to use only certain antennas. Efforts to make the DSN antennas more "interchangeable," primarily in their transmitter and receiver suites, would be an effective means of ensuring expanded capability. Additional findings from this work are that, while additional use of the MSPA capability might appear to be a promising means for increasing the mission suite, there appear to be no locations in the Solar System, other than Mars, for which it would be effective.</description>

      <title>SAS in ESA Datalabs: A New Platform for XMM-Newton Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XMM-Newton is a cornerstone mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) for X-ray astronomy, providing high-quality X-ray data for astrophysical research since the start of the century. Its Science Analysis System (SAS) has been a reliable data reduction and analysis software, evolving throughout the years to meet changing user needs, while incorporating new methods. This paper presents the XMM-SAS Datalab, a tool within the cloud-based ESA Datalabs platform, designed to enhance the interactivity and collaborative potential of SAS. By integrating SAS with a modern, Python-based JupyterLab interface, it enables shared analysis workspaces, removes the need for local software setup, and provides faster access through containerised environments and preconfigured libraries. Moving SAS to the cloud preserves a consistent software setup while eliminating installation complexities, saving time and effort. A case study of the X-ray binary Vela X-1 demonstrates that the Datalabs platform reliably replicates local SAS outputs, with minimal deviations attributed to calibration file versions. The XMM-SAS Datalab allows straightforward X-ray data analysis with collaborative process, setting the way for future adaptations in e-science platforms and multi-wavelength astronomy, while offering traceability and reproducibility of scientific results.</description>

      <title>SETI@home: Data Acquisition and Front-End Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SETI@home is a radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, looking for technosignatures in data recorded at multiple observatories from 1998 to 2020. Most radio SETI projects analyze data using dedicated processing hardware. SETI@home uses a different approach: time-domain data is distributed over the Internet to $\gt 10^{5}$ volunteered home computers, which analyze it. The large amount of computing power this affords ($\sim 10^{15}$ floating-point operations per second (FPOP/s)) allows us to increase the sensitivity and generality of our search in three ways. We use coherent integration, a technique in which data is transformed so that the power of drifting signals is confined to a single discrete Fourier transform (DFT) bin. We perform this coherent search over 123 000 Doppler drift rates in the range ($\pm$100 Hz s$^{-1}$). Second, we search for a variety of signal types, such as pulsed signals and arbitrary repeated waveforms. The analysis uses a range of DFT sizes, with frequency resolutions ranging from 0.075 Hz to 1221 Hz. The front end of SETI@home produces a set of detections that exceed thresholds in power and goodness of fit. We accumulated $\sim 1.2\times 10^{10}$ such detections. The back end of SETI@home takes these detections, identifies and removes radio frequency interference (RFI), and looks for groups of detections that are consistent with extraterrestrial origin and that persist over long timescales. This paper describes the front end of SETI@home and provides parameters for the primary data source, the Arecibo Observatory; the back end and its results are described in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>SETI@home: Data Analysis and Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SETI@home is a radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project that looks for technosignatures in data recorded at the Arecibo Observatory. The data were collected over a period of 14 years and cover almost the entire sky visible to the telescope. The first stage of data analysis found billions of detections: brief excesses of continuous or pulsed narrowband power. The second stage removed detections that were likely radio frequency interference (RFI), then identified and ranked signal candidates: groups of detections, possibly spread over the 14 years, that plausibly originate from a single cosmic source. We manually examined the top-ranking signal candidates and selected a few hundred. In the third and final stage we are reobserving the corresponding sky locations and frequency ranges using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) radio telescope. This paper covers SETI@home's second stage of data analysis. We describe the algorithms used to remove RFI and to identify and rank signal candidates. To guide the development of these algorithms, we used artificial candidate birdies that model persistent ET signals with a range of power, bandwidth, and planetary motion parameters. This approach also allowed us to estimate the sensitivity of our detection system to these signals.</description>

      <title>Technosignature Searches with Real-time Alert Brokers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploration of technosignature research that is possible using real-time alert brokers from surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Nine alert brokers currently stream up to 1 million alerts each night from ZTF, and LSST is projected to increase this volume by an order of magnitude. While these brokers are primarily designed to facilitate real-time follow-up of explosive transients such as supernovae, they offer a unique platform to discover rare forms of variability from nearby stars in real time, which is crucial for follow-up and characterization. We evaluate the capability for both spatial and temporal searches for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) methods using the currently available brokers, and present examples of technosignature searches using ZTF alert and archival data. We have deployed optical SETI techniques, such as planetary transit zone geometries and the SETI Ellipsoid. We have also developed a search for novel high-amplitude stellar dippers, and present a workflow that integrates features available directly through the brokers, as well as post-processing steps that build on the existing capabilities. Though the SETI methods that alert brokers can execute are currently limited, we provide suggestions that may enhance future technosignature and anomaly searches in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference with the Event Horizon Telescope III. Zingularity results from the 2017 observations and predictions for future array expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) In the first two papers of this publication series, we present a comprehensive library of synthetic EHT observations and used this library to train and validate Bayesian neural networks for the parameter inference of accreting supermassive black hole systems. The considered models are ray-traced GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87*. In this work, we infer the best-fitting accretion and black hole parameters from 2017 EHT data and predict improvements that will come with future upgrades of the array. Compared to previous EHT analyses, we considered a substantially larger synthetic data library and the most complete set of information from the observational data. We made use of the Bayesian nature of the trained neural networks and apply bootstrapping of known systematics in the observational data to obtain parameter posteriors. Within a wide GRMHD parameter space, we find M87* to be best described by a spin between 0.5 and 0.94 with a retrograde MAD accretion flow and strong synchrotron emission from the jet. Sgr A* has a high spin of $\sim$ 0.8 $-$ 0.9 and a prograde accretion flow beyond the standard MAD/SANE models with a comparatively weak jet emission, seen at a $\sim$ 20$^\circ$ $-$ 40$^\circ$ inclination and $\sim$ 106$^\circ$ $-$ 137$^\circ$ position angle. While previous EHT analyses could rule out specific regions in the model parameter space considered here, we are able to obtain narrow parameter posteriors with our Zingularity framework without being impacted by the unknown foreground Faraday screens and data calibration biases. We further demonstrate that the AMT extension to the EHT will reduce parameter inference errors by a factor of three for non-Kerr models, enabling more robust tests of general relativity. It will be instructive to produce new GRMHD models with the inferred interpolated parameters to study their accretion rate plus jet power.</description>

      <title>Search for Astrophysical Transients on Limiting Time Scales and Their Classification Based on INTEGRAL Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have searched for ultra-long (&gt; 100 s) gamma-ray transients in the data from the anticoincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI gamma-ray spectrometer onboard the INTEGRAL orbital observatory and classified them by machine learning methods. We have found about 4364 candidates for such events in the SPI-ACS data by the `blind' threshold search method. We have developed an algorithm for automatic processing of their light curves that distinguishes a candidate for transients on various time scales and allows its duration and fluence to be determined. The algorithm has been applied to calculate (and compare) the fluxes in the light curves recorded by various INTEGRAL detectors: IREM, SPI-ACS, SPI, ISGRI, and PICsIT. These fluxes have been used to train the classifier based on gradient boosting. Subsequently, we have performed a cluster analysis of the candidates found by the dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. In conclusion we have compared the remaining candidates with the data from the Konus-WIND gamma-ray detectors. Thus, we have confirmed 16 candidates for astrophysical transients, including four candidates for ultra-long gamma-ray bursts from the events detected by the SPI-ACS detector. Out of the probable events, but unconfirmed by other experiments, up to 270 events can be classified as real gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Optical Characterization of Near-Earth Objects: Science Commissioning of the Recently Upgraded Mid-Infrared Camera MIRSI on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) have historically been a valuable tool for understanding their physical properties. However, the current state of mid-IR instruments on ground-based telescopes places several limitations on performing thermal characterization of NEOs. The complexity of maintaining these instruments in operational conditions on telescopes has led to their decommissioning. Here, we present the first science commissioning observations out to 12.5 microns from the upgraded Mid-Infrared Spectrograph and Imager (MIRSI) at the NASA-IRTF. We obtained 42 observations of 31 NEOs and derived their diameters and albedos. Since MIRSI allows simultaneous optical observations with its MIRSI Optical Camera (MOC), we were able to determine the absolute magnitude for most of the targets at the time of the thermal acquisition. We present ejecta characterization for the Didymos system from observations made 11 hours and 9 days after the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) impact. We present albedo and size measurements for (98943) Torifune 2001 CC21, the fly-by target of the Japanese Extended Hayabusa2 Mission. We also highlight several applications that the MIRSI system will provide for future airless body characterization, such as constraining thermal inertia from simultaneous optical and thermal lightcurves. This work also demonstrates the importance of having MIRSI as an available rapid-response instrument for planetary defense purposes.</description>

      <title>Multiple machine-learning as a powerful tool for the star clusters analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a multiple machine learning method (MMLM) aiming to improve the accuracy and robustness in the analysis of star clusters. The MMLM performance is evaluated by applying it to the reanalysis of the old binary cluster candidate - NGC 1605a and NGC 1605b - found by Camargo (2021) (hereafter C21). The binary cluster candidate is analyzed by employing a set of well established machine learning algorithms applied to the Gaia-EDR3 data. Membership probabilities and open clusters (OCs) parameters are determined by using the clustering algorithms pyUPMASK, ASteCA, Kmeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN. In addition, a KNN smoothing algorithm is implemented to enhances the visualization of features like overdensities in the 5D space and intrinsic stellar sequences on the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The method validates the clusters' parameters previously derived, however, suggests that their probable members-stars are distributed over a wider overlapping area. Finally, a combination of the elbow method, t-SNE, kmeans, and GMM algorithms group the normalized data into 6 clusters, following C21. In short, these results confirm NGC1605a and NGC1605b as genuine OCs and reinforce the previous suggestion that they form an old binary cluster in an advanced stage of merging after a tidal capture during a close encounter. Thus, MMLM has proven to be a powerful tool that helps to obtain more accurate and reliable clusters parameters and its application in future studies may contribute to a better characterization of the Galaxy's star cluster system.</description>

      <title>VLBA astrometry of PSRs B0329+54 and B1133+16: Improved pulsar distances and comparison of global ionospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) astrometry is used to determine the three-dimensional position and proper motion of astronomical objects. A typical VLBI astrometric campaign generally includes around ten observations, making it challenging to characterise systematic uncertainties. Our study on two bright pulsars, B0329+54 and B1133+16, involves analysis of broadband Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data over $\sim30$ epochs (spanning approximately $3.5\, {\rm years}$). This extended dataset has significantly improved the precision of the astrometric estimates of these pulsars. Our broadband study suggests that, as expected, the primary contribution to systematic uncertainties in L-band VLBI astrometry originates from the ionosphere. We have also assessed the effectiveness of the modified TEC (total electron content) mapping function, which converts vertical TEC to slant TEC, in correcting ionospheric dispersive delays using global TEC maps. The parallax and proper motion obtained from the multiple data sets, calibrated using the traditional and the modified TEC mapping functions, are consistent. However, the reduced chi-square values from least-squares fitting and precision of the fitted astrometric parameters show no significant improvement, and hence, the effectiveness of the new TEC mapping function on astrometry is unclear. For B0329+54, the refined parallax estimate is $0.611^{+0.013}_{-0.013}\, {\rm mas}$, with best-fit proper motion of $\mu_{\alpha} = 16.960^{+0.011}_{-0.010}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in R.A. and and $\mu_{\delta} = -10.382^{+0.022}_{-0.022}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ in Dec. For B1133+16, the new estimated parallax is $2.705^{+0.009}_{-0.009}\, {\rm mas}$, with proper motions of $\mu_{\alpha} = -73.777^{+0.008}_{-0.008}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$ and $\mu_{\delta} = 366.573^{+0.019}_{-0.019}\, {\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the second and third data releases (DR2 and DR3, respectively) from the ongoing United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Hemisphere Survey (UHS). DR2 is primarily comprised of the $K$-band portion of the UHS survey, and was released to the public on June 1, 2023. DR3 mainly includes the $H$-band portion of the survey, with a public release scheduled for September 2025. The $H$- and $K$-band data releases complement the previous $J$-band data release (DR1) from 2018. The survey covers approximately 12,700 square degrees between declinations of 0 degrees and $+$60 degrees and achieves median 5$\sigma$ point source sensitivities of 19.0 mag and 18.0 mag (Vega) for $H$ and $K$, respectively. The data releases include images and source catalogs which include $\sim$581 million $H$-band detections and $\sim$461 million $K$-band detections. DR2 and DR3 also include merged catalogs, created by combining $J$- and $K$-band detections (DR2) and $J$-, $H$-, and $K$-band detections (DR3). The DR2 merged catalog has a total of $\sim$513 million sources, while the DR3 merged catalog contains $\sim$560 million sources.</description>

      <title>Application of a modified commercial laser mass spectrometer as a science analog of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ESA/NASA Rosalind Franklin rover, planned for launch in 2028, will carry the first laser desorption ionization mass spectrometer (LDI-MS) to Mars as part of the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) instrument. MOMA will contribute to the astrobiology goals of the mission through the analysis of potential organic biosignatures. Due to the minimal availability of comparable equipment, laboratory analyses using similar techniques and instrumentation have been limited. In this study, we present a modified commercial benchtop LDI-MS designed to replicate MOMA functionality and to enable rapid testing of samples for MOMA validation experiments. We demonstrate that our instrument can detect organic standards in mineral matrices, with MS/MS enabling structural identification even in complex mixtures. Performance was additionally validated against an existing LDI-MS prototype through the comparison of spectra derived from natural samples from a Mars analog site in the Atacama Desert. Lastly, analysis of Mars analog synthetic mineral mixes highlights the capacity of the instrument to characterize both the mineralogical and organic signals in mission-relevant samples. This modified benchtop instrument will serve as a platform for collaborative research to prepare for MOMA operations, test LDI parameters, and generate pre-flight reference data in support of the mission science and astrobiology specific goals.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models -- the Future of Fundamental Physics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many fundamental physics applications, transformers, as the state of the art in learning complex correlations, benefit from pretraining on quasi-out-of-domain data. The obvious question is whether we can exploit Large Language Models, requiring proper out-of-domain transfer learning. We show how the Qwen2.5 LLM can be used to analyze and generate SKA data, specifically 3D maps of the cosmological large-scale structure for a large part of the observable Universe. We combine the LLM with connector networks and show, for cosmological parameter regression and lightcone generation, that this Lightcone LLM (L3M) with Qwen2.5 weights outperforms standard initialization and compares favorably with dedicated networks of matching size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting the faint gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal from dominant detector noise and disentangling its %diverse astrophysical and cosmological components remain significant challenges for traditional methods like cross-correlation analysis. We propose a novel hybrid approach that combines deep learning with Bayesian inference to identify and characterize the GWB more rapidly than current techniques. Our method utilizes a custom-designed multi-scale multi-headed autoencoder (MSMHAutoencoder) architecture to separate GWB signals from detector noise, and subsequently Marcov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation to disentangle the GWB components. Using simulated data representative of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network at design sensitivity, we show that our MSMHAutoencoder can detect with high confidence (log noise Bayes factor of 3) a GWB from binary black hole mergers with fractional energy density $\Omega_{\text{BBH}} \approx 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz. In the presence of such an astrophysical GWB, we can simultaneously measure a cosmological component as faint as $\Omega_{\text{Cosmo}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-10}$ using 47.4 days of training data.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of a Universal SiPM Readout System for X- and Gamma-Ray Missions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of both multi-messenger and time-domain astrophysics over the last decade has seen a large interest in the development of small-scale, cheap, and robust gamma-ray detectors. This has been further encouraged by the availability of CubeSat platforms. Of particular interest are detectors capable of producing spectral and localization measurements of X and gamma-ray transients to allow for accurate follow-up measurements at different wavelengths. A vast number of the instruments developed for such purposes in the last years use a combination of scintillators and Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) for photon detection. Here, we present the design, performance, and space qualification of a readout system capable of reading out 64 SiPM channels. This low-power and low-cost system was originally designed for the POLAR-2 mission, a large scale gamma-ray polarimeter. However, its flexible design makes it equally suitable for use on various CubeSat missions. The system was found to perform well when reading out both plastic and high Z scintillators using a total of 1.8~W. The space qualified design furthermore relies on commercial off-the-shelf components, thereby also removing most international export issues. In this paper, we will present the overall design, the performance of the electronics, its performance when reading out various scintillators and the successful space-qualification of this design.</description>

      <title>Determination of Hubble constant from Megamaser Cosmology Project using Profile Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Megamaser Cosmology Project inferred a value for the Hubble constant given by $H_0=73.9 \pm 3.0 $ km/sec/Mpc. This value was obtained using Bayesian inference by marginalizing over six nuisance parameters, corresponding to the velocities of the megamaser galaxy systems. We obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant with the same data using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to dispense with the aforementioned nuisance parameters. The frequentist estimate of the Hubble constant is given by $H_0=73.5^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km/sec/Mpc and agrees with the Bayesian estimate to within $0.2\sigma$, and both approaches also produce consistent confidence/credible intervals. Therefore, this analysis provides a proof-of-principle application of profile likelihood in dealing with nuisance parameters in cosmology, which is complementary to Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Modeling of Correlated Noise in Space-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the statistical properties of noise is important in data analysis for space-based gravitational wave detectors. Noise in different time-delay interferometry channels correlates with each other. Many studies often assume uncorrelated noise and ignore the off-diagonal elements in the noise covariance matrix. This could lead to some bias in the parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals. In this paper, we present a framework for reconstructing the full noise covariance matrix, including frequency-dependent auto- and cross-correlated power spectral densities, without assuming the parametric analytic expressions of the noise model. Our approach combines spline interpolation with trigonometric basis functions to construct a semi-analytical representation of the noise. We then employ trans-dimensional Bayesian inference to fit the correlated noise structure.The resulting software package, $\texttt{NOISAR}$, successfully recovers both auto- and cross-correlated power spectral features with a relative error of about $10\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We used laser ablation to fabricate sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating (SWS-ARC) on a 5 cm diameter alumina lens. With an aspect ratio of 2.5, the SWS-ARC are designed to give a broad-band low reflectance response between 110 and 290 GHz. SWS shape measurements conducted on both sides of the lens give 303 $\mu$m pitch and total height between 750 and 790 $\mu$m, matching or exceeding the aspect ratio design values. Millimeter-wave transmittance measurements in a band between 140 and 260 GHz show the increase in transmittance expected with the ARC when compared to finite element analysis electromagnetic simulations. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SWS-ARC on an alumina lens, opening the path for implementing the technique for larger diameter lenses.</description>

Abstract: In preparation for cosmological analyses of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC) has created a 300 deg$^2$ simulated survey as part of an effort called Data Challenge 2 (DC2). The DC2 simulated sky survey, in six optical bands with observations following a reference LSST observing cadence, was processed with the LSST Science Pipelines (19.0.0). In this Note, we describe the public data release of the resulting object catalogs for the coadded images of five years of simulated observations along with associated truth catalogs. We include a brief description of the major features of the available data sets. To enable convenient access to the data products, we have developed a web portal connected to Globus data services. We describe how to access the data and provide example Jupyter Notebooks in Python to aid first interactions with the data. We welcome feedback and questions about the data release via a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Silkscreen: Direct Measurements of Galaxy Distances from Survey Image Cutouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With upcoming wide field surveys from the ground and space the number of known dwarf galaxies at $\lesssim 25$ Mpc is expected to dramatically increase. Insight into their nature and analyses of these systems' intrinsic properties will rely on reliable distance estimates. Currently employed techniques are limited in their widespread applicability, especially in the semi-resolved regime. In this work we turn to the rapidly growing field of simulation based inference to infer distances, and other physical properties, of dwarf galaxies directly from multi-band images. We introduce silkscreen: a code leveraging neural posterior estimation to infer the posterior distribution of parameters while simultaneously training a convolutional neural network such that inference is performed directly on the images. Utilizing this combination of machine learning and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the method's ability to recover accurate distances from ground-based survey images for a set of nearby galaxies ($2 &lt; D ({\rm Mpc)} &lt; 12$) with measured SBF or TRGB distances. We discuss caveats of the current implementation along with future prospects, focusing on the goal of applying silkscreen to large upcoming surveys, like LSST. While the current implementation performs simulations and training on a per-galaxy basis, future implementations will aim to provide a broadly-trained model that can facilitate inference for new dwarf galaxies in a matter of seconds using only broadband cutouts. We focus here on dwarf galaxies, we note that this method can be generalized to more luminous systems as well.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors such as KAGRA, a 3-km long underground laser interferometer in Japan, require elaborate passive and active seismic isolation of their mirrors. With the aim of detecting passing gravitational waves that create a relative mirror displacement of less than $10^{-22}\ \mathrm{m}$ at frequencies of tens to hundreds of Hz, all environmental couplings must be stringently suppressed. This paper presents the result of applying the H-infinity optimization method to the active seismic isolation of a gravitational-wave detector for the first time. The so-called \textit{sensor correction} and \textit{sensor fusion} schemes of the seismic attenuation system of KAGRA's signal recycling mirror are used as a test bed. We designed and implemented optimal sensor correction and sensor fusion filters, resulting in a sevenfold attenuation of seismic noise coupling to the signal recycling mirror in the 0.1-0.5 Hz band, with the downstream effect of an 88.2% noise performance improvement in the same frequency band. When combined with other hardware upgrades, the implementation of sensor correction and sensor fusion contributed to an increase in KAGRA's duty cycle from 53% in the O3GK observation run to 80% in O4a, demonstrating the effectiveness of the H-infinity optimization approach.</description>

      <title>First characterisation of the MAGO cavity, a superconducting RF detector for kHz-MHz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image pipeline for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract 1-year light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_{\rm E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive simulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic double white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary backgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji's sensitivity across a range of signal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly detect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities exceeding $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$ across most of its frequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors and the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that validate our statistical methodology.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Non-Potential Magnetic Field Parameters in a Super-Active Region with Complex Structures and Strong Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the non-potential magnetic field parameters of active region NOAA 9077 are investigated; this AR experienced a super-strong X5.7 solar flare. Using advanced extrapolation techniques, the 3D magnetic field structure from vector magnetograms is obtained from the Solar Magnetic Field Telescope (SMFT) at Huairou Solar Observing Station (HSOS). Then various non-potential parameters are calculated, including current density, shear angle, quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), twist, and field line helicity. By analyzing the spatial and temporal distributions of these parameters, we aim to shed light on the relationship between magnetic field properties and solar flare occurrence. Our findings reveal that high twist and complex magnetic field configurations are prevalent before flares, while these features tend to weaken after the eruption. Additionally, we observe decreases in helicity and free energy after the flare, while the free energy peaks approximately 1.5 days prior to the onset of the flare. Furthermore, we investigate the distribution of quasi-separatrix layers and twist, finding high degrees of complexity before flares. Multiple patterns of high current density regions suggest unstable magnetic structures prone to flaring, coinciding with shear angle distribution. Relative field line helicity patterns exhibit distinct characteristics compared to current density, concentrating before flares and diverging afterward. Overall, our results highlight the contrasting nature of current density and relative field line helicity patterns in relation to solar flares, in addition to the aforementioned feature in the set of commonly derived non-potential parameters for this particular event.</description>
