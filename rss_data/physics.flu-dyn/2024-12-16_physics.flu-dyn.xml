      <title>Unified gas-kinetic scheme for reactive flow with multi-scale transport and chemical non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive flows for rarefied gas mixtures involve a multi-scale transport characterized by particle collisions and free streaming, and non-equilibrium physics containing multi-species interactions, and chemical non-equilibrium. These flows are pivotal in aerospace engineering and semiconductor manufacturing, impacting spacecraft control and thermal protection in near-space flight, and plasma etching for chip processing. Therefore, the simulation of these multi-scale and non-equilibrium flow is of scientific and industrial significance. Following the methodology of direct modeling, the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is constructed to describe the multi-scale transport of gas molecules across all flow regimes. This study extends the UGKS to the reactive flows with chemical non-equilibrium for the capture of more complex flow physics. Test cases, including shock structures, hypersonic flows around a two-dimensional cylinder and the three-dimensional re-entry and space vehicle, and nozzle plume flow into a vacuum, are used to validate the UGKS through the comparison with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The study shows that the methodology of direct modeling and the extended UGKS have great potential for simulating multi-scale flows with complex non-equilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Universality of extreme events in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universality of small scales, a cornerstone of turbulence, has been nominally confirmed for low-order mean-field statistics, such as the energy spectrum. However, small scales exhibit strong intermittency, exemplified by formation of extreme events which deviate anomalously from a mean-field description. Here, we investigate the universality of small scales by analyzing extreme events of velocity gradients in different turbulent flows, viz. direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, inhomogeneous channel flow, and laboratory measurements in a von Karman mixing tank. We demonstrate that the scaling exponents of velocity gradient moments, as function of Reynolds number ($Re$), are universal, in agreement with previous studies at lower $Re$, and further show that even proportionality constants are universal when considering one moment order as a function of another. Additionally, by comparing various unconditional and conditional statistics across different flows, we demonstrate that the structure of the velocity gradient tensor is also universal. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence that even extreme events are universal, with profound implications for turbulence theory and modeling.</description>

      <title>Linear instability in highly shear thinning fluids through a pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear-thinning fluids flowing through pipes are crucial in many practical applications, yet many unresolved problems remain regarding their turbulent transition. Using highly robust numerical tools for the Carreau-Yasuda model, we discovered that linear instability, characterised by an azimuthal wavenumber of unity, can occur. When the base flow behaves like power law fluids, two distinct unstable modes, a wall mode and a core mode, appear when the power law index falls below the critical values of 0.35 and 0.43, respectively. The viscosity ratio from infinite to zero shear rate can significantly impact instability, even if it is small, as observed in experiments. Under the parameters used in one of the experiments, where a linear critical point exists, we found that the nonlinear solutions undergo a supercritical bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Interface instability of two-phase flow in a three-dimensional porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of immiscible, two-phase fluid flow through a three-dimensional porous medium consisting of randomly-packed, monodisperse glass spheres. Our experiments combine refractive-index matching and laser-induced fluorescence imaging to resolve the morphology and stability of the moving interface resulting from the injection of one fluid into another. The imposed injection rate sets a balance between gravitational and viscous forces, producing interface morphologies which range from unstable collections of tangled fingers at low rates to stable sheets at high rates. The image data are complemented by time-resolved pressure measurements. We develop a stability criterion for the fluid interface based on the analysis of the 3D images and the pressure data. This criterion involves the Darcy permeability in each of the two phases and the time derivative of the pressure drop across the medium. We observe that the relative permeability encountered by the invading fluid is modified by the imposed flow rate in our experiment, which impacts the two-phase flow dynamics. We show that, in addition to the balance between the relevant forces driving the dynamics, local regions of crystalline order in the beadpack (crystallites) affect the stability of the invading front. This work provides insights into how disorder on multiple length scales in porous media can interact with viscous, capillary, and gravitational forces to determine the stability and dynamics of immiscible fluid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Instabilities of ring-rivulets: Impact of substrate wettability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rivulets and droplets are naturally appearing shapes when small amounts of liquid are deposited on a partially wettable substrate. Here we study, by means of numerical simulations, the dewetting dynamics of a ring-rivulet on substrates with various contact angles and wettability patterns. In particular, we consider, beyond the homogeous case, an annular band of lower contact angle as compared to the background and a constant radial gradient of contact angle, pointing either inward or outward from the centre. We show that by tuning the parameters characterizing the patterns, it is possible to control not only the stability of the rivulet, i.e. its breakup/collapse dynamics and the associated time scales, but also the dewetting morphology, in terms of number and position of the formed droplets.</description>

      <title>Cavitation Onset in an Impulsively Accelerated Liquid Column</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel piston-driven apparatus to study the onset of cavitation in an impulsively accelerated liquid column as it compresses a closed gas volume. The experiment is monitored using high-speed videography and piezoelectric pressure transducers. Cavitation onset is observed in the liquid column as it undergoes an abrupt deceleration and is associated with a sudden drop in pressure in the liquid that leads to negative pressure (tension). A novel numerical modeling approach is introduced where the liquid column is treated as a spring-mass system. This approach can reproduce compressibility effects in the liquid column and is used to investigate the wave dynamics responsible for the onset of tension and cavitation in the liquid column. The model is formulated as a coupled set of non-linear differential equations that reproduce the dynamics of an experiment while capturing the pressure wave activity in the liquid column. A parametric study is conducted experimentally and numerically to investigate the behavior behind the onset of cavitation. The mechanism for the onset of cavitation is identified as a series of wave reflections at the boundaries of the liquid column, and this mechanism is found to be well reproduced by the model. While a traditional cavitation number criterion is shown to be unable to predict cavitation onset in our experiment, our numerical model is found to correctly predict the onset of cavitation for a wide range of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Rotating convection with a melting boundary: an application to the icy moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A better understanding of the ice-ocean couplings is required to better characterise the hydrosphere of the icy moons. Using global numerical simulations in spherical geometry, we have investigated here the interplay between rotating convection and a melting boundary. To do so, we have implemented and validated a phase field formulation in the open-source code \texttt{MagIC}. We have conducted a parameter study varying the influence of rotation, the vigour of the convective forcing and the melting temperature. We have evidenced different regimes akin to those already found in previous monophasic models in which the mean axisymmetric ice crust transits from pole-ward thinning to equator-ward thinning with the increase of the rotational constraint on the flow. The derivation of a perturbative model of heat conduction in the ice layer enabled us to relate those mean topographic changes to the underlying latitudinal heat flux variations at the top of the ocean. The phase change has also been found to yield the formation of sizeable non-axisymmetric topography at the solid-liquid interface with a typical size close to that of the convective columns. We have shown that the typical evolution timescale of the interface increases linearly with the crest-to-trough amplitude and quadratically with the mean melt radius. In the case of the largest topographic changes, the convective flows become quasi locked in the topography due to the constructive coupling between convection and ice melting. The tentative extrapolation to the planetary regimes yields $\mathcal{O}(10^2-10^3)$ meters for the amplitude of non-axisymmetric topography at the base of the ice layer of Enceladus and $\mathcal{O}(10^3-10^4)$ meters for Titan.</description>

      <title>Subcritical axisymmetric solutions in rotor-stator flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotor-stator cavity flows are known to exhibit unsteady flow structures in the form of circular and spiral rolls. While the origin of the spirals is well understood, that of the circular rolls is not. In the present study the axisymmetric flow in an aspect ratio $R/H=10$ cavity is revisited {numerically using recent concepts and tools from bifurcation theory}. It is confirmed that a linear instability takes place at a finite critical Reynolds number $Re=Re_c$, and that there exists a subcritical branch of large amplitude chaotic solutions. This motivates the search for subcritical finite-amplitude solutions. The branch of periodic states born in a Hopf bifurcation at $Re=Re_c$, identified using a Self-Consistent Method (SCM) and arclength continuation, is found to be supercritical. The associated solutions only exist, however, in a very narrow range of $Re$ and do not explain the subcritical chaotic rolls. Another subcritical branch of periodic solutions is found using the Harmonic Balance Method with an initial guess obtained by SCM. In addition, edge states separating the steady laminar and chaotic regimes are identified using a bisection algorithm. These edge states are bi-periodic in time for most values of $Re$, {where} their dynamics is {analysed in detail}. Both solution branches fold around at approximately the same value of $Re$, which is lower than $Re_c$ yet still larger than the values reported in experiments. This suggests that, at least in the absence of external forcing, sustained chaotic rolls have their origin in the bifurcations from these unstable solutions.</description>

      <title>On the origin of circular rolls in rotor-stator flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotor-stator flows are known to exhibit instabilities in the form of circular and spiral rolls. While the spirals are known to emanate from a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, the origin of the circular rolls is still unclear. In the present work we suggest a quantitative scenario for the circular rolls as a response of the system to external forcing. We consider two types of axisymmetric forcing: bulk forcing (based on the resolvent analysis) and boundary forcing using direct numerical simulation. Using the singular value decomposition of the resolvent operator the optimal response is shown to take the form of circular rolls. The linear gain curve shows strong amplification at non-zero frequencies following a pseudo-resonance mechanism. The optimal energy gain is found to scale exponentially with the Reynolds number $Re$ (for $Re$ based on the rotation rate and interdisc spacing $H$). The results for both types of forcing are compared with former experimental works and previous numerical studies. Our findings suggest that the circular rolls observed experimentally are the effect of the high forcing gain together with the roll-like form of the leading response of the linearised operator. For high enough Reynolds number it is possible to delineate between linear and nonlinear response. For sufficiently strong forcing amplitudes, the nonlinear response is consistent with the self-sustained states found recently for the unforced problem. The onset of such non-trivial dynamics is shown to correspond in state space to a deterministic leaky attractor, as in other subcritical wall-bounded shear flows.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic theory of premixed flames under Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical implications of applying Darcy's law to premixed flames, a topic of growing interest in research on flame propagation in porous media and confined geometries. A multiple-scale analysis is carried out treating the flame as a hydrodynamic discontinuity in density, viscosity and permeability. The analysis accounts in particular for the inner structure of the flame. A simple model is derived allowing the original conservation equations to be replaced by Laplace's equation for pressure, applicable on both sides of the flame front, subject to specific conditions across the front. Such model is useful for investigating general problems under confinement including flame instabilities in porous media or Hele-Shaw channels. In this context, two Markstein numbers are identified, for which explicit expressions are provided. In particular, our analysis reveals novel contributions to the local propagation speed arising from discontinuities in the tangential components of velocity and gravitational force, which are permissible in Darcy's flows to leading order, but not in flows obeying Euler or Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Topological Entropy of Two Dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformation of material lines drives transport and dissipation in many industrial and natural flows. Here we report an exact Eulerian formula for the stretching rate of a material line, also known as the topological entropy, in a prototype two-dimensional fluid. The only requirement is a distribution of eigenvalues of the strain rate tensor and their decorrelation time. This eliminates the need for Lagrangian tracking in experimental turbulence where particle trajectories are entangled, and thus poorly resolved. Numerical simulations reveal an excellent agreement between our Eulerian estimate and the stretching rate of a Lagrangian material line, over a wide range of Reynolds number.</description>
