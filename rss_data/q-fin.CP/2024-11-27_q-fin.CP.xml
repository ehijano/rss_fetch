      <title>FinML-Chain: A Blockchain-Integrated Dataset for Enhanced Financial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is critical for innovation and efficiency in financial markets, offering predictive models and data-driven decision-making. However, challenges such as missing data, lack of transparency, untimely updates, insecurity, and incompatible data sources limit its effectiveness. Blockchain technology, with its transparency, immutability, and real-time updates, addresses these challenges. We present a framework for integrating high-frequency on-chain data with low-frequency off-chain data, providing a benchmark for addressing novel research questions in economic mechanism design. This framework generates modular, extensible datasets for analyzing economic mechanisms such as the Transaction Fee Mechanism, enabling multi-modal insights and fairness-driven evaluations. Using four machine learning techniques, including linear regression, deep neural networks, XGBoost, and LSTM models, we demonstrate the framework's ability to produce datasets that advance financial research and improve understanding of blockchain-driven systems. Our contributions include: (1) proposing a research scenario for the Transaction Fee Mechanism and demonstrating how the framework addresses previously unexplored questions in economic mechanism design; (2) providing a benchmark for financial machine learning by open-sourcing a sample dataset generated by the framework and the code for the pipeline, enabling continuous dataset expansion; and (3) promoting reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration by fully open-sourcing the framework and its outputs. This initiative supports researchers in extending our work and developing innovative financial machine-learning models, fostering advancements at the intersection of machine learning, blockchain, and economics.</description>

      <title>Joint Combinatorial Node Selection and Resource Allocations in the Lightning Network using Attention-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lightning Network (LN) has emerged as a second-layer solution to Bitcoin's scalability challenges. The rise of Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) and their specific mechanisms incentivize individuals to join the network for profit-making opportunities. According to the latest statistics, the total value locked within the Lightning Network is approximately \$500 million. Meanwhile, joining the LN with the profit-making incentives presents several obstacles, as it involves solving a complex combinatorial problem that encompasses both discrete and continuous control variables related to node selection and resource allocation, respectively. Current research inadequately captures the critical role of resource allocation and lacks realistic simulations of the LN routing mechanism. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, enhanced by the power of transformers, to address the Joint Combinatorial Node Selection and Resource Allocation (JCNSRA) problem. We have improved upon an existing environment by introducing modules that enhance its routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap with the actual LN routing system and ensuring compatibility with the JCNSRA problem. We compare our model against several baselines and heuristics, demonstrating its superior performance across various settings. Additionally, we address concerns regarding centralization in the LN by deploying our agent within the network and monitoring the centrality measures of the evolved graph. Our findings suggest not only an absence of conflict between LN's decentralization goals and individuals' revenue-maximization incentives but also a positive association between the two.</description>

      <title>Randomization of Short-Rate Models, Analytic Pricing and Flexibility in Controlling Implied Volatilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on extending existing short-rate models, enabling control of the generated implied volatility while preserving analyticity. We achieve this goal by applying the Randomized Affine Diffusion (RAnD) method to the class of short-rate processes under the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework. Under arbitrage-free conditions, the model parameters can be exogenously stochastic, thus facilitating additional degrees of freedom that enhance the calibration procedure. We show that with the randomized short-rate models, the shapes of implied volatility can be controlled and significantly improve the quality of the model calibration, even for standard 1D variants. In particular, we illustrate that randomization applied to the Hull-White model leads to dynamics of the local volatility type, with the prices for standard volatility-sensitive derivatives explicitly available. The randomized Hull-White (rHW) model offers an almost perfect calibration fit to the swaption implied volatilities.</description>

      <title>Market Misconduct in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Analysis, Regulatory Challenges and Policy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technological advancement drives financial innovation, reshaping the traditional finance landscape and redefining user-market interactions. The rise of blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) underscores this intertwined evolution of technology and finance. While DeFi has introduced exciting opportunities, it has also exposed the ecosystem to new forms of market misconduct. This paper aims to bridge the academic and regulatory gaps by addressing key research questions about market misconduct in DeFi. We begin by discussing how blockchain technology can potentially enable the emergence of novel forms of market misconduct. We then offer a comprehensive definition and taxonomy for understanding DeFi market misconduct. Through comparative analysis and empirical measurements, we examine the novel forms of misconduct in DeFi, shedding light on their characteristics and social impact. Subsequently, we investigate the challenges of building a tailored regulatory framework for DeFi. We identify key areas where existing regulatory frameworks may need enhancement. Finally, we discuss potential approaches that bring DeFi into the regulatory perimeter.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Error Analysis of Multilevel Stochastic Approximations for the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cr\'epey, Frikha, and Louzi (2023) introduced a nested stochastic approximation algorithm and its multilevel acceleration to compute the value-at-risk and expected shortfall of a random financial loss. We hereby establish central limit theorems for the renormalized estimation errors associated with both algorithms as well as their averaged versions. Our findings are substantiated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Refined and Segmented Price Sentiment Indices from Survey Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to enhance a price sentiment index and to more precisely understand price trends from the perspective of not only consumers but also businesses. We extract comments related to prices from the Economy Watchers Survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan and classify price trends using a large language model (LLM). We classify whether the survey sample reflects the perspective of consumers or businesses, and whether the comments pertain to goods or services by utilizing information on the fields of comments and the industries of respondents included in the Economy Watchers Survey. From these classified price-related comments, we construct price sentiment indices not only for a general purpose but also for more specific objectives by combining perspectives on consumers and prices, as well as goods and services. It becomes possible to achieve a more accurate classification of price directions by employing a LLM for classification. Furthermore, integrating the outputs of multiple LLMs suggests the potential for the better performance of the classification. The use of more accurately classified comments allows for the construction of an index with a higher correlation to existing indices than previous studies. We demonstrate that the correlation of the price index for consumers, which has a larger sample size, is further enhanced by selecting comments for aggregation based on the industry of the survey respondents.</description>
