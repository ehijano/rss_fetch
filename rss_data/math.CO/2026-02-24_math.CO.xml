      <title>Maximal Equidistant Spacings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a family $\{Y_1,\dots,Y_I\}$ in Euclidean space an equidistance spacing if $\|y_i - y_j\| = 1$ whenever $y_i \in Y_i, y_j \in Y_j$ and $i \neq j$. In other words, choosing a representative from each set produces a complete distance graph (i.e. equilateral set). We say such a spacing is maximal if each $Y_i$ is maximal under inclusion. In this work we characterize maximal equidistant spacings in $\mathbb R^n$. For each equidistant spacing there is an associated center (a point in $\mathbb R^n$) and radius (a non-negative scalar) so that the centers form an orthocentric system. Using arguments from classical geometry we find that the moduli space of maximal equidistant spacings is described in terms of the movement of its center and radii. Using tools from geometric combinatorics, we develop a discrete combinatorial object called the signature. Our classification theorem shows that maximal equidistant spacings are isometric if and only if they have the same signature. We also construct all maximal equidistant spacings in $\mathbb R^1,\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbb R^3$, outline a procedure for constructing all maximal equidistant spacings in $\mathbb R^n$, and give an algorithm for checking if a locus of points is equidistantly spaced that is linear in the number of points, an improvement over the naive direct quadratic algorithm.</description>

      <title>The number of non-isomorphic arithmetic expressions that can be constructed using +,-,x and /</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to count the number of distinct functions of n variables, up to permutation of the variables, that can be constructed using each variable exactly once, without constants, using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We refer to such a function as an arithmetic expression. Under this definition, two expressions are identical if they represent the same rational function; for example, $x_1-x_2-x_3$ and $x_1-(x_2+x_3)$ are identical arithmetic expressions, as are $x_1(x_2+x_3)$ and $(x_2+x_3)x_1$. Two arithmetic expressions are said to be isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by a permutation of the variables. For example, $(x_1-x_2)/x_3$ and $(x_2-x_3)/x_1$ are isomorphic. The first few values of the number of non-isomorphic arithmetic expressions with n variables are: $$1,4,18,93,500,2844,16621,99674,608448,...$$ In order to accomplish this enumeration, we classify the set of all arithmetic expressions into 12 disjoint categories. Counting all non-isomorphic expressions in each category allows us to obtain the total required quantity.</description>

      <title>A note on a cyclotomic-friendly application of RSK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial realization of a level-$\ell$ Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence conjectured to exist by Song and Wang for cyclotomic Schur categories. We show that cyclotomic basis elements can be canonically reorganized into flagged block composition matrices encoding families of biwords, so that the correspondence is obtained by applying the classical RSK correspondence componentwise. This perspective identifies the level-$\ell$ correspondence as an iteration of classical RSK, specializing to the usual correspondence when $\ell=1$ and behaving naturally under restriction to lower levels.</description>

      <title>The Sandpile Group of a Cone Over a Bi-Coconut Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sandpile group of a connected graph is a finite abelian group whose cardinality is the number of spanning trees in the graph. We compute the spanning tree number and sandpile group structure for the cone over a bi-coconut tree, generalizing work of Reiner and Smith on the cone over a coconut tree. We also answer one of their questions, by exhibiting a family of trees whose sandpile groups are all cyclic but their number of leaves grows without bound.</description>

      <title>Mixed jeu de taquin and a problem of Soojin Cho</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serrano (2010) introduced the shifted plactic monoid, governing Haiman's (1989) mixed insertion algorithm, as a type B analogue of the classical plactic monoid that connects jeu de taquin of Young tableaux with the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth insertion algorithm. Serrano proposed a corresponding definition of skew shifted plactic Schur functions. Cho (2013) disproved Serrano's conjecture regarding this definition, by showing that the functions do not live in the desired ring and hence cannot provide an algebraic interpretation of tableau rectification or of the corresponding structure coefficients. Cho asked for a new definition with particular properties. We introduce such a definition and prove that it behaves as desired. We also introduce a new jeu de taquin theory that computes mixed insertion.</description>

      <title>Locating-dominating coalitions in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $D$ of vertices in a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a locating-dominating set (LD-set) if it is dominating and every two vertices $u$, $v$ of $V\setminus D$ satisfy $N(u) \cap D \neq N(v) \cap D$. Two disjoint sets $A,B\subset V(G)$ form a locating-dominating coalition (for short, an LD-coalition) in $G$ if none of them is an LD-set in $G$ but their union $A\cup B$ is an LD-set. A locating-dominating coalition partition (for short, an LDC-partition) is a vertex partition $\Pi$ such that every set of $\Pi$ is not an LD-set in $G,$ but forms an LD-coalition with another set of $\Pi$. The locating-domination coalition number of $G$, denoted by $C_{L}(G),$ equals the maximum cardinality of an LDC-partition of $G$. Our purpose in this paper is to initiate the study of locating-dominating coalitions in graphs. We first investigate the existence of LDC-partitions. We also obtain lower and upper bounds on $C_{L}(G)$. We characterize connected graphs $G$ of order $n\ge 3$ satisfying $C_L(G) = n,$ as well as those trees $T$ such that $C_L(T)=n-1$. In addition, we determine the exact values of $C_L(G)$ for some classes of graphs. Moreover, we investigate the computational complexity of the decision problem associated with locating-dominating coalition partitions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the algorithmic complexity of a decision problem related to coalition partitions, not only for this locating-dominating model but for coalition partitions in general.</description>

      <title>A $B$-Restricted Clique Polynomial and Connections to Tanner's Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and $B \subseteq V(G)$.
  We study the \emph{$B$-restricted clique polynomial} $C_B(G;x)$, including its weighted version allowing vertex multiplicities, as a versatile tool to capture structural properties of vertex subsets.
  First, we develop a complete deletion theory for $C_B(G;x)$, including vertex and edge recurrences that generalize classical clique polynomial results.
  These recurrences yield monotonicity principles for the largest negative root $\zeta_G(B)$: it is monotone under induced subgraphs and reverse-monotone under spanning subgraphs.
  Consequently, we derive explicit bounds on $B$-independence numbers, chromatic numbers, $B$-girth, and Hamiltonicity constraints, showing that $\zeta_G(B)$ serves as a unifying local invariant.
  Next, we connect $B$-clique polynomials to spectral graph theory.
  For $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs, spectral techniques, including the Expander Mixing Lemma and Tanner's inequality, provide uniform bounds on $B$-restricted clique coefficients, demonstrating that clique growth within $B$ is naturally controlled by the spectral gap.
  Finally, we show that weighted $B$-clique polynomials encode \emph{homomorphism constraints}.
  Specifically, if $f: G \to H$ is a surjective homomorphism mapping $B_G$ onto $B_H$, then $\zeta_G(B_G) \ge \zeta_H(B_H)$, yielding a local \emph{no-homomorphism criterion} based on $B$-roots.
  Overall, $C_B(G;x)$ provides a unified framework capturing combinatorial, spectral, and homomorphic information in vertex-restricted analysis, highlighting its power for both global and local structural insights.</description>

      <title>Constructions of two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes of weight three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of optical orthogonal codes has been motivated by an application in an optical code-division multiple access system. This paper focuses on optimal two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes with autocorrelation and cross-correlation both equal to $1$. By examining the structures of $n$-cyclic group divisible packings and semi-cyclic incomplete holey group divisible designs, we present new combinatorial constructions for two-dimensional $(m\times n,k,1)$-optical orthogonal codes. As a consequence, the exact number of codewords of an optimal two-dimensional $(m\times n,3,1)$-optical orthogonal code is determined for any positive integers $m$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>The Strong Spectral Property and the Jacobian Method for Weighted Laplacian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong matrix properties, roughly speaking, refer to generic conditions on a matrix such that its spectral perturbation and pattern perturbation interact nicely to cover a neighborhood in the ambient space. With a rich history, these strong properties originate from various fields, including the inverse eigenvalue problem, the sign pattern problem, and structural graph theory. In this paper, we introduce a new strong property, the strong spectral property for weighted Laplacian matrices (SSPWL), and establish the corresponding Supergraph and Bifurcation lemmas. Instead of the space of symmetric matrices, the SSPWL considers the ambient space spanned by all weighted Laplacian matrices. Moreover, we provide a detailed study comparing the Jacobian Method and some strong properties, leading to a full understanding between these two techniques used in different problems. Using these tools, we identify the potential boundaries of the spectral regions of weighted Laplacian matrices associated with connected graphs on $4$ vertices, extending the analysis from the previous work [S. M. Fallat, H. Gupta, and J. C.-H. Lin. Inverse eigenvalue problem for Laplacian matrices of a graph. SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 46:1866--1886, 2025]. In addition, this analysis can be used to identify the absolute algebraic connectivity of such small ordered graphs, and we establish the existence of strong weighted Laplacian matrices for several graph families.</description>

      <title>Kneser- and Jin-type inverse theorems in discrete abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the pairs of sets $A, B$ in an arbitrary (countable or uncountable) discrete abelian group $\Gamma$ satisfying $\tilde{m}(A+B)&lt;\tilde{m}(A)+\tilde{m}(B)$, where $\tilde{m}$ is an arbitrary finitely additive translation-invariant probability measure on $\Gamma$, extending M.~Kneser's theorem on Haar measure in compact abelian groups.
  We then characterize, for an arbitrary F{\o}lner sequence or F{\o}lner net $\mathbf F=(F_{i})_{i\in I}$ on $\Gamma$, those $A$, $B$ satisfying $\underline{d}_{\mathbf F}(A+B)&lt;\underline{d}_{\mathbf F}(A)+\underline{d}_{\mathbf F}(B)$, where $\underline{d}_{\mathbf F}(C):=\liminf_{i\in I} |C\cap F_{i}|/|F_{i}|$. This extends Kneser's theorem on lower asymptotic density in $\mathbb N$.
  We also generalize theorems of Prerna Bihani and Renling Jin by characterizing pairs $A$, $B$ satisfying $d^{*}(A+B)&lt;d^{*}(A)+d^{*}(B)$, where $d^{*}$ is upper Banach density on $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>$2$-limited broadcast domination in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a function $f:V(G) \to \{0,1,2\}$ is called a $2$-limited dominating broadcast on $G$ if for every vertex $u$, there exists a vertex $v$ such that $f(v)&gt;0$ and the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$ is at most $f(v)$. The {\it cost} of $f$ means the value $\sum_{v\in V(G)}f(v)$, and the {\it $2$-limited broadcast domination number} of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{b,2}(G)$, is the cost of a $2$-limited dominating broadcast on $G$ with minimum cost. Henning, MacGillivray, and Yang (2020) conjectured that $\gamma_{b,2}(G)\leq \frac{|V(G)|}{3}$ for every cubic graph $G$. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Structural similarity between polyhedral embeddings and their duals and its application to self-duality of pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph embedded on a closed surface. We call $G$ a \emph{polyhedral embedding} if all facial walks are cycles, and any two of them are either disjoint or intersect in a single vertex or a single edge. In this paper, we present a new bound on the relation between the pathwidth of a polyhedral embedding and its dual. More precisely, we prove that for a polyhedral embedding $G$ on a closed surface with Euler characteristic $\chi$, $\mathsf{pw}(G^*) \leq 3\ \mathsf{pw}(G)+c$, where $c$ is a constant depending only on $\chi$. This result improves the coefficient of $\mathsf{pw}(G)$ in the previously known bound by Fomin and Thilikos (2007) and extends that of Amini, Huc, and P\'erennes (2009) for plane graphs. Furthermore, we obtain analogous bounds on the treewidth and pathwidth of the face subdivision of a polyhedral embedding. Our approach is based on a new quantitative estimate which demonstrates the structural similarity between a polyhedral embedding and its dual.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The change-making problem was recently extended to sets of positive integers not containing the element $1$, and from there to numerical semigroups. A greedy numerical semigroup is defined as a numerical semigroup where the greedy representation of an element is optimal with respect to the number of summands. In this paper we identify some new families of greedy numerical semigroups.</description>

      <title>Structure of sets with small product sets in torsion-free groups, cyclic groups of prime orders and abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ and $m$ be positive integers with $\ell \leq m$, and let $\mathcal{A} = (A_1, \ldots, A_m)$ be a finite sequence of finite subsets of a group $G$ (not necessarily abelian), written multiplicatively. The {\it generalized product set} $\Pi^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of all elements of $G$ which can be represented as a product of exactly $\ell$ elements from $\ell$ distinct sets from $\mathcal{A}$ taken in any order. DeVos, Goddyn and Mohar obtained the nontrivial lower bound for the size of this product set when $G$ is abelian. The DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem is a fundamental result in additive combinatorics which unifies various results from zero-sum combinatorics and has connections with subsequence sums and sumsets. In this paper, we obtain an optimal lower bound for the size of generalized product set ${\Pi}^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ in torsion-free groups (not necessarily abelian), and characterize the structure of underlying sets in the sequence $\mathcal{A} = (A_1, \ldots, A_m)$ for which ${\Pi}^{\ell}(\mathcal{A})$ achieves the optimal lower bound. By slightly modifying the arguments of the proofs in the case of torsion-free groups, we derive such inverse theorems in cyclic groups of prime orders also. Our proof of these result also yields a new proof of DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Moreover, we extend these inverse results to arbitrary abelian groups. Furthermore, as an application, we generalize a theorem for subsequence sums due to Hamidoune in torsion-free groups, and obtain several other results for subsequence sums in arbitrary groups.</description>

      <title>Towards the Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture for 4-uniform hypergraphs: stability and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous conjecture of Erd\H{o}s asserts that for $k\ge 3$, the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph without $s+1$ pairwise disjoint edges is $\max\{\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-s}{k},\binom{sk+k-1}{k}\}$. This problem has been central in extremal combinatorics, with substantial progress in the literature, including a complete solution for $k=3$ due to the first author. In this paper, we make progress towards the $4$-uniform case, proving the conjecture for $n\ge 5s$ and sufficiently large $n$, thereby taking a first step analogous to the $3$-uniform case. The main technical contribution is a stability result of independent interest. We further apply this stability to resolve two new instances of conjectures on the minimum $d$-degree threshold for matchings in $5$- and $6$-uniform hypergraphs, in a strengthened form.</description>

Abstract: We derive precise asymptotic expressions for the expectations, variances, covariance, and quite a few further mixed moments for the number of hairpins and the number of basepairs in RNA secondary structures, and give convincing evidence that the central-scaled distribution of the pair of random variables (hairpins, basepairs) tends in distribution to the bi-variate normal distribution with correlation $\sqrt{5 \sqrt{5} -11}/2= 0.2123322205\dots$</description>

      <title>Skeletal Snub Polyhedra in Ordinary Space, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeletal polyhedra are discrete connected structures consisting of finite (planar or skew) or infinite (linear, planar, or spatial) polygons as faces, with two faces on each edge and a circular vertex figure at each vertex. The present paper describes the blueprint for the snub construction and shows that it can be applied to both regular and chiral skeletal polyhedra in ordinary space. The resulting skeletal snub polyhedra are vertex-transitive and highly locally symmetric. Their properties - from a combinatorial, topological, and geometric perspective - are described and illustrated on some particularly interesting examples. We examine when the construction yields uniform skeletal polyhedra and discuss the completeness of our list of generated structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a combinatorial interpretation for Laurent polynomials obtained by iteratively mutating a certain periodic quiver that has been framed with frozen vertices. This yields a family of cluster variables with principal coefficients associated to a family of integer sequences known as Gale-Robinson sequences. The work of this paper completes arguments for preliminary results announced in earlier work of Jeong-Musiker-Zhang, and relates to works of Bousquet-M\'elou-Propp-West, Speyer, Vichitkunakorn, and of Eager-Franco.</description>

Abstract: On the maximum number of colors for proper anti-rainbow colorings on a planar quadrangulation, an upper bound was given by Enami-Ozeki-Yamaguchi in terms of the independence number. In this paper, as an extension, we introduce the half-monochromatic coloring on a plane graph with even polygonal faces, and give an upper bound on the maximum number of colors for such colorings in terms of the independence number.</description>

      <title>On $r$-cross $t$-intersecting families of partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address several intersection problems for $r$-cross $t$-intersecting families of partitions. A $k$-partition of an $n$-set $X$ is a set of $k$ pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets whose union is $X$. For $1\leq i\leq r$, let $\mathcal{F}_i$ be a family of $k_i$-partitions of $X$. We say that $\mathcal{F}_1,\mathcal{F}_2,\ldots,\mathcal{F}_r$ are $r$-cross $t$-intersecting if $|\cap_{i=1}^{r}F_i|\geq t$ for all $F_i\in\mathcal{F}_i$. The families are called non-trivial if $|\cap_{i=1}^r(\cap_{F\in\mathcal{F}_i}F)|&lt;t$. Proving an Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorem, we determine the families maximizing $\prod_{i=1}^r|\mathcal{F}_i|$. We further determine non-trivial $r$-cross $t$-intersecting families with maximum product of sizes; this result also serves as a Hilton-Milner type theorem. In particular, for $r=2$ there are two potential structures for optimal families, and for $r\geq3$ exactly one remains.</description>

      <title>A Note on Gr\"{u}nbaum's Conjecture about Longest Cycles and Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $c(G)$ denote the circumference of a graph $G$, i.e., the number of vertices in its longest cycle. For positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $n&gt;k$, let $\varGamma(n;k)$ be the class of graphs of order $n$ with $c(G) = n-k$ such that every induced subgraph of order $n-k$ is Hamiltonian. When $k=$, the class $\varGamma(n; 1)$ coincides with the family of hypohamiltonian graphs-non-Hamiltonian graphs in which the deletion of any single vertex yields a Hamiltonian graph.Replacing Hamiltonian with traceable and $c(G)$ with $p(G)$, the order of a longest path, defines the analogous class $\varPi(n;k)$.Gr\"{u}nbaum (1974) conjectured that both $\varGamma(n; k)$ and $\varPi(n; k)$ are empty for all $n&gt;k \ge 2$. In this note, we first establish upper bounds on the maximum degree of graphs in the classes $\varGamma(n; k)$ and $\varPi(n; k)$. Using these bounds, we show that $\varGamma(n; k)$ is empty when $n&lt;k^2+2k+3$, and that $\varPi(n; k)$ is empty when $n&lt;k^2+2k+2$. These results provide further evidence supporting Gr\"{u}nbaum's conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an explicit and implementable framework for constructing spherical designs by lifting point sets from tight fusion frames. By combining existing ingredients, we obtain, in every dimension, explicit spherical $5$-designs with $|X|=\mathcal{O}(d^3)$. As a core component of the method, we give an explicit construction of simplex $3$-designs realized as orbits of the symmetric group. Using these simplex designs as input, we further construct spherical $7$-designs in arbitrary even dimensions; more precisely, for every even integer $d\ge 6$ we obtain spherical $7$-designs in dimension $d$, and if $\frac{d}{2}-1$ is a prime power then the number of points is $\mathcal{O}(d^6)$.</description>

      <title>New bounds for (weak) sequenceability in $\mathbb{Z}_k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous conjecture of Graham asserts that every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_p \setminus \{0\}$ can be ordered so that all partial sums are distinct. Although this conjecture was recently proved for sufficiently large primes by Pham and Sauermann in [16], it remains open for general abelian groups, even in the cyclic case $\mathbb{Z}_k$.
  For cyclic groups, the best known result is due to Bedert and Kravitz in [4], who proved - using a rectification and a two-step probabilistic approach - that the conjecture holds for any subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_k \setminus \{0\}$ such that $$ |A| \le \exp\!\big(c(\log p)^{1/4}\big), $$ for some constant $c&gt;0$, where $p$ denotes the least prime divisor of $k$.
  In this paper, we improve their bound using a rectification argument again, followed by a one-shot probabilistic approach, showing that the conjecture holds whenever $$|A| \le \exp\!\big(c(\log p)^{1/3}\big), $$ thus improving the exponent $1/4$ from [4].
  Moreover, the same one-shot approach adapts to the $t$-weak setting: by imposing all local constraints at once and applying the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, we obtain the existence of a $t$-weak sequencing whenever $$ t \le \exp\!\big(c(\log p)^{1/4}\big). $$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple approach to big Ramsey combinatorics of the Cantor set $2^\omega$. Using Infinite Dual Ramsey Theorem of Carlson and Simpson, we show that $2^\omega$, viewed as a topological space, has finite big Ramsey degrees. We then examine several natural topological first-order structures arising from the Cantor set and prove that each of them inherits finite big Ramsey degrees. As a consequence, we obtain a simple proof of Blass' perfect set theorem, although our method does not recover the sharp bound $(n-1)!$ for the number of colors. We also show that the complete Boolean algebra on countably many atoms has finite big Ramsey degrees, in contrast with the recent result showing that the countable atomless Boolean algebra does not have big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>An efficient recursive decomposition algorithm for undirected graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of undirected graphs simplifies complex problems by breaking them into solvable subgraphs, following the philosophy of divide and conquer. This paper investigates the relationship between atom decomposition and the maximum cardinality search (MCS) ordering in general undirected graphs. Specifically, we prove that applying a convex extension to the node numbered $1$ and its neighborhood in an MCS ordering yields an atom in the graph. Furthermore, based on the MCS ordering, we introduce a recursive algorithm for decomposing an undirected graph into its atoms. This approach closely aligns with the results of chordal graph decomposition. As a result, minimal triangulation of the graph is no longer required, and the identification of clique minimal separators is avoided. In the experimental section, we combine the proposed decomposition algorithm with two existing convex expansion methods. The results show that both combinations significantly outperform the existing algorithms in terms of efficiency.</description>

By constructing an explicit homotopy inverse to the graph nerve functor associating an n-fibrant cubical set to a graph, we are also able to give explicit computations of several previously unknown discrete homotopy groups of boundaries of cubes and suspensions of cycles.</description>

      <title>On factorization of matrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}(W,S)$ be the Hecke algebra of the Coxeter system $(W,S)$ over $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1}]$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we show that the matrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of $\mathcal{H}$ factorizes into a product of $|S|$ many matrices, each of which has entries as polynomials in $q$ with nonnegative coefficients. To achieve this goal, we use hybrid basis $TC^J$ for $J\subseteq S$ of $\mathcal{H}$, defined by Grojnowski-Haiman. The intermediate matrices in the aforementioned factorization turn out to be the transition matrices from $TC^J$-basis to $TC^I$-basis for $I\subset J$. Equivalently, these coefficients can be computed using a natural restriction map from $\mathcal{H}$ to the parabolic Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_J$. Moreover, following the ideas from Grojnowski-Haiman, we also give a geometric proof of the positivity of these coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19727v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet series associated with the integers whose radix-$b$ representation misses certain (fixed) digits. The existence of a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane, which was already well-known as a general fact valid for $b$-automatic Dirichlet series, is proven anew from a representation as an everywhere defined series with good convergence properties. A generating function related to the residues on the real axis is shown to be the multiplicative inverse of the moment generating function for the associated Cantor set in the unit interval. This makes the (normalized) residues some sort of generalized Bernoulli numbers.</description>

      <title>Relevant maps and the algebraic skeleton of simplicial toric prevarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morphisms between schemes arising from multigraded rings are essential for understanding geometric relationships in algebraic geometry, yet a systematic theory for such maps has been lacking. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework for rational maps between multigraded Proj schemes by introducing several notions of maps between their underlying multigraded rings. A key challenge is that to induce actual morphisms (rather than just rational maps), the ring homomorphism $\varphi\colon R \to S$ must hit every relevant element in $S$. To address this, we introduce the use of relevant subsets $B \subseteq S_+$ (where $S_+$ is the ideal generated by all relevant elements), $B \unlhd S$, which allow us to control this condition more flexibly.
  As an application, we show that multigraded noetherian polynomial rings naturally encode combinatorial data, giving rise to systems of fans and thus to toric prevarieties. By leveraging our notion of rational maps with those relevant subsets, we prove that the category of triples $(D, S, B)$ - where $D$ is a finitely generated abelian group, $S$ is a $D$-graded noetherian polynomial ring, and $B \unlhd S$ is a subset of $S_+$ - together with rational maps of conical rings, is anti-equivalent to the category of simplicial toric prevarieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the identified sets of a wide range of stochastic choice models, including random utility, various models of boundedly-rational behavior, and dynamic discrete choice. In each of these settings, we show two distributions over choice rules are observationally equivalent if and only if they can be obtained from one another via a finite sequence of simple swapping transforms. We leverage this to obtain complete descriptions of both the defining inequalities and extreme points of these identified sets. In cases where choice frequencies vary smoothly with some parameters, we provide a novel global-inverse result for practically testing identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By selecting a specific input or output of a dioperadic tree, we transform it into a rooted tree and induce a corresponding colored operadic structure. This fundamental pictorial construction demonstrates how the machinery of Gr\"obner bases and the theory of Hilbert series (well-established for (colored) operads) can be adapted to the dioperadic setting.
  We illustrate this framework by providing several examples and applications: (1) we compute the dimensions of the spaces of operations for the dioperad of Lie bialgebras; (2) we describe a Gr\"obner basis and a minimal resolution for the dioperad of triangular Lie bialgebras; (3) we provide computations for the dioperad of ``algebraic string operations''; (4) we present a graphical construction that establishes the existence of quadratic Gr\"obner bases and the Koszul property for a broad class of dioperads originating from cyclic operads.</description>

      <title>On a discrete max-plus transportation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit algorithm to solve the idempotent analogue of the discrete Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transportation problem with the usual real number field replaced by the tropical (max-plus) semiring, in which addition is defined as the maximum and product is defined as usual addition, with minus infinity and zero playing the roles of additive and multiplicative identities. Such a problem may be naturally called tropical or "max-plus" optimal transportation problem. We show that the solutions to the latter, called the optimal tropical plans, may not correspond to perfect matchings even if the data (max-plus probability measures) have all weights equal to zero, in contrast with the classical discrete optimal transportation analogue, where perfect matching optimal plans in similar situations always exist. Nevertheless, in some randomized situation the existence of perfect matching optimal tropical plans may occur rather frequently. At last, we prove that the uniqueness of solutions of the optimal tropical transportation problem is quite rare.</description>

      <title>The oriented chromatic number of random graphs of bounded degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic number of the random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ has long been studied and has inspired several landmark results. In the case where $p = d/n$, Achlioptas and Naor showed the chromatic number is asymptotically concentrated at $k_d$ or $k_d+1$, where $k_d$ is the smallest integer such that $d &lt; 2k_d\log k_d$. Kemkes et al. later proved the same result holds for $\mathcal{G}(n,d)$, the random $d$-regular graph. We consider the oriented chromatic number of the directed models $\vec{\mathcal{G}}(n,p)$ and $\vec{\mathcal{G}}(n,d)$, improving the best known upper bound from $O(d^2 2^d)$ to $O(\sqrt{e}^d)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of 123-avoiding permutation on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with a fixed leading terms is counted by the ballot numbers. The same holds for $132$-avoiding permutations. These results were proved by Miner and Pak using the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence to connect permutations with Dyck paths. In this paper, we first provide an alternate proof of these enumeration results via a direct counting argument. We then study the number of pattern-avoiding permutations with a fixed prefix of length $t\geq1$, generalizing the $t=1$ case. We find exact expressions for single and pairs of patterns of length three as well as the pair $3412$ and $3421$. These expressions depend on $t$, the extrema, and the order statistics. We also define $r$-Wilf equivalence for permutations with a single fixed leading term $r$, and classify the $r$-Wilf-equivalence classes for both classical and vincular patterns of length three.</description>

Abstract: A $k$-bisection of a multigraph $G$ is a partition of its vertex set into two parts of the same cardinality such that every component of each part has at most $k$ vertices. Cui and Liu shown that every claw-free cubic multigraph contains a $2$-bisection, while Eom and Ozeki constructed specific $2$-bisections with bounded number of monochromatic edges. Their bound is the best possible for claw-free cubic simple graphs. In this note, we extend the latter result to the larger family of claw-free cubic multigraphs</description>

      <title>On the Ohba Number and Generalized Ohba Numbers of Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a graph $G$ is chromatic-choosable when its list chromatic number $\chi_{\ell}(G)$ is equal to its chromatic number $\chi(G)$. Chromatic-choosability is a well-studied topic, and in fact, some of the most famous results and conjectures related to list coloring involve chromatic-choosability. In 2002 Ohba showed that for any graph $G$ there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the join of $G$ and a complete graph on at least $N$ vertices is chromatic-choosable. The Ohba number of $G$ is the smallest such $N$. In 2014, Noel suggested studying the Ohba number, $\tau_{0}(a,b)$, of complete bipartite graphs with partite sets of size $a$ and $b$. In this paper we improve a 2009 result of Allagan by showing that $\tau_{0}(2,b) = \lfloor \sqrt{b} \rfloor - 1$ for all $b \geq 2$, and we show that for $a \geq 2$, $\tau_{0}(a,b) = \Omega( \sqrt{b} )$ as $b \rightarrow \infty$. We also initiate the study of some relaxed versions of the Ohba number of a graph which we call generalized Ohba numbers. We present some upper and lower bounds of generalized Ohba numbers of complete bipartite graphs while also posing some questions.</description>

      <title>Maximum Persistent Betti Numbers of \v{C}ech Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note proves that only a linear number of holes in a \v{C}ech complex of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can persist over an interval of constant length. Specifically, for any fixed dimension $p &lt; d$ and fixed $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the number of $p$-dimensional holes in the \v{C}ech complex at radius $1$ that persist to radius $1 + \varepsilon$ is bounded above by a constant times $n$, where $n$ is the number of points. The proof uses a packing argument supported by relating the \v{C}ech complexes with corresponding snap complexes over the cells in a partition of space. The argument is self-contained and elementary, relying on geometric and combinatorial constructions rather than on the existing theory of sparse approximations or interleavings. The bound also applies to Alpha complexes and Vietoris-Rips complexes. While our result can be inferred from prior work on sparse filtrations, to our knowledge, no explicit statement or direct proof of this bound appears in the literature.</description>

      <title>Abelian groups without 3-chromatic Cayley graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an abelian group. The main theorem of this paper asserts that there exists a Cayley graph on $G$ with chromatic number $3$ if and only if $G$ is not of exponent $1$, $2$, or $4$. For connected Cayley graphs, we also show that this theorem holds when $G$ is finitely generated. Although motivated by ideas from algebraic topology, our proof may be expressed purely combinatorially. As a by-product, we derive a topological result which is of independent interest. Suppose $X$ is a connected non-bipartite graph, and let $\N(X)$ denote its neighborhood complex. We show that if the fundamental group $\pi_1(\N(X))$ or first homology group $H_1(\N(X))$ is torsion, then the chromatic number of $X$ is at least $4$. This strengthens a special case of a classical result of Lov\'asz, which derives the same conclusion if $\pi_1(\N(X))$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>On the existence of factors intersecting sets of cycles in regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent result by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a and Zerafa [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 160 (2023) 1--14] related to the famous Berge-Fulkerson conjecture implies that given an arbitrary set of odd pairwise edge-disjoint cycles, say $\mathcal O$, in a bridgeless cubic graph, there exists a $1$-factor intersecting all cycles in $\mathcal O$ in at least one edge. This remarkable result opens up natural generalizations in the case of an $r$-regular graph $G$ and a $t$-factor $F$, with $r$ and $t$ being positive integers. In this paper, we start the study of this problem by proving necessary and sufficient conditions on $G$, $t$ and $r$ to assure the existence of a suitable $F$ for any possible choice of the set $\mathcal O$. First of all, we show that $G$ needs to be $2$-connected. Under this additional assumption, we highlight how the ratio $\frac{t}{r}$ seems to play a crucial role in assuring the existence of a $t$-factor $F$ with the required properties by proving that $\frac{t}{r} \geq \frac{1}{3}$ is a further necessary condition. We suspect that this condition is also sufficient, and we confirm it in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{3}$, generalizing the case $t=1$ and $r=3$ proved by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a, Zerafa, and in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{2}$ with $t$ even. Finally, we provide further results for the case where even cycles are included.</description>

      <title>Counting Problems for Orthogonal Sets and Sublattices in Function Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}=\mathbb{F}_q((x^{-1}))$. Analogous to orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a well-studied notion of ultrametric orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, we extend the work of Soffer-Aranov and Behajaina on counting problems related to orthogonality in $\mathcal{K}^n$. For example, we resolve an open question posed in Soffer-Aranov and Behajaina by bounding the size of the largest ``orthogonal sets'' in $\mathcal{K}^n$. Furthermore, using similar ideas and techniques, we investigate analogues of Hadamard matrices over $\mathcal{K}$. Finally, we also use ultrametric orthogonality to compute the number of sublattices of $\mathbb{F}_q[x]^n$ with a certain geometric structure, and to determine the number of orthogonal bases of a sublattice in $\mathcal{K}^n$. The resulting formulas depend crucially on successive minima.</description>

      <title>State transfer in Grover walks on unitary and quadratic unitary Cayley graphs over finite commutative rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on two well-known families of Cayley graphs, namely, the unitary Cayley graphs and the quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring. The unitary Cayley graph $G_R$ has vertex set $R$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $u-v$ is a unit in $R$. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the periodicity of the Cayley graph $G_R$. We also completely determine the rings $R$ for which $G_R$ exhibits perfect state transfer. The quadratic unitary Cayley graph $\mathcal{G}_R$ has vertex set $R$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $u-v$ or $v-u$ is a square of some units in $R$. It is well known that any finite commutative ring $R$ can be expressed as $R_1\times\cdots\times R_s$, where each $R_i$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $M_i$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,s\}$. We characterize periodicity and perfect state transfer on $\mathcal{G}_R$ under the condition that $|R_i|/|M_i|\equiv 1 \pmod 4$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,s\}$. Also, we characterize periodicity and perfect state transfer on $\mathcal{G}_R$, where $R$ can be expressed as $R_0\times\cdots\times R_s$ such that $|R_0|/|M_0|\equiv3\pmod 4$, and $|R_i|/|M_i|\equiv1\pmod4$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots, s\}$, where $R_i$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $M_i$ for $i\in\{0,\ldots,s\}$.</description>

Abstract: Rational Dyck paths are the rational generalization of classical Dyck paths. They play an important role in Catalan combinatorics, and have multiple applications in algebra and geometry. Two statistics over rational Dyck paths called run and ratio-run are introduced. They both have symmetric joint distributions with the return statistic. We give combinatorial proofs and algebraic proofs of the symmetries, generalizing a result of Li and Lin.</description>

      <title>On the $d$-transversal number of cylindrical and toroidal grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $d$, a $d$-transversal set of a graph $G$ is an edge subset $T\subseteq E(G)$ such that $|T\cap M|\geq d$ for every maximum matching $M$ of $G$. The $d$-transversal number of $G$, denoted by $\tau_d(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a $d$-transversal set in $G$. It is NP-complete to determine the $d$-transversal number of a bipartite graph for any fixed $d\geq 1$. Ries et al. (Discrete Math. 310 (2010) 132-146) established the $d$-transversal number of rectangular grids $P_m\square P_n$. In this paper, we consider cylindrical grids $P_m\square C_n$ and toroidal grids $C_m\square C_n$. We derive explicit expressions for the $d$-transversal numbers of $P_m\square C_n$ for $m\geq 1$ and even $n\geq 4$, or even $m\geq 2$ and $n=3$, and of $C_m\square C_n$ with even order, for $1\leq d\leq \frac{mn}{2}$. For the other cases we obtain explicit expressions or bounds for their $d$-transversal numbers.</description>

      <title>Stability with minuscule structure for chromatic thresholds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic threshold $\delta_\chi(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the infimum of $d&gt;0$ such that the chromatic number of every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph with minimum degree at least $d n$ is bounded by a constant depending only on $H$ and $d$. Allen, B{\"o}ttcher, Griffiths, Kohayakawa, and Morris determined the chromatic threshold for every $H$; in particular, they showed that if $\chi(H)=r\ge 3$, then $\delta_\chi(H) \in\{\frac{r-3}{r-2},~\frac{2 r-5}{2 r-3},~\frac{r-2}{r-1}\}$. While the chromatic thresholds have been completely determined, rather surprisingly the structural behaviors of extremal graphs near the threshold remain unexplored.
  In this paper, we establish the stability theorems for chromatic threshold problems. We prove that every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\ge (\delta_\chi(H)-o(1))n$ and $\chi(G)=\omega(1)$ must be structurally close to one of the extremal configurations. Furthermore, we give a stronger stability result when $H$ is a clique, showing that $G$ admits a partition into independent sets and a small subgraph on sublinear number of vertices. We show that this small subgraph has fractional chromatic number $2+o(1)$ and is homomorphic to a Kneser graph defined by subsets of a logarithmic size set; both these two bounds are best possible. This is the first stability result that captures the lower-order structural features of extremal graphs.
  We also study two variations of chromatic thresholds. Replacing chromatic number by its fractional counterpart, we determine the fractional chromatic thresholds for all graphs. Another variation is the bounded-VC chromatic thresholds, which was introduced by Liu, Shangguan, Skokan, and Xu very recently. Extending work of {\L}uczak and Thomass{\'e} on the triangle case, we determine the bounded-VC chromatic thresholds for all cliques.</description>

Abstract: For a fixed poset $\mathcal P$ we say that a family $\mathcal F\subseteq\mathcal P([n])$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if it does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but whenever we add a new set to $\mathcal F$, we form an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. The size of the smallest such family is denoted by $\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal P)$.\par For the diamond poset $\mathcal D_2$ (the two-dimensional Boolean lattice), while it is easy to see that the saturation number is at most $n+1$, the best known lower bound has stayed at $O(\sqrt n)$ since the introduction of the area of poset saturation. In this paper we prove that $\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal D_2)\geq \frac{n+1}{5}$, establishing that the saturation number for the diamond is linear. The proof uses a result about certain pairs of set systems.</description>

      <title>Plabic Tangles and Cluster Promotion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the BCFW recurrence for tilings of the amplituhedron, we introduce the general framework of `plabic tangles' that utilizes plabic graphs to define rational maps between products of Grassmannians called `promotions'. The central conjecture of the paper is that promotion maps are quasi-cluster homomorphisms, which we prove for several classes of promotions. In order to define promotion maps, we utilize $m$-vector-relation configurations ($m$-VRCs) on plabic graphs. We relate $m$-VRCs to the degree (a.k.a `intersection number') of the amplituhedron map on positroid varieties and characterize all plabic trees with intersection number one and their VRCs. Finally, we show that promotion maps admit an operad structure and, supported by the class of `$4$-mass box' promotions, we point at new positivity properties for non-rational maps beyond cluster algebras. Promotion maps have important connections to the geometry and cluster structure of the amplituhedron and singularities of scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Integral bases, perfect matchings, and the Petersen graph</title>

Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a matching-covered graph, denote by $P$ its perfect matching polytope, and by $L$ the integer lattice generated by the integral points in $P$. In this paper, we give short, polyhedral proofs for two difficult results established by Lov\'{a}sz (1987), and by Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty (2002) in a series of three papers totaling over 120 pages. More specifically, we prove that $L$ has a lattice basis consisting solely of incidence vectors of some perfect matchings of $G$, $2x\in L$ for all $x\in \mathrm{lin}(P)\cap \mathbb{Z}^E$, and if $G$ has no Petersen brick then $L = \mathrm{lin}(P)\cap \mathbb{Z}^E$. Our proof avoids major technical aspects of the previous proofs, the most important of these being a characterization of the dual lattice, and a `Petersen-brick-sensitive' ear decomposition result for matching-covered graphs. This is achieved by a novel study of the facial structure of the polytope $P$ and its relationship with the lattice $L$. Along the way, we give a new polyhedral characterization of the Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Structural Characterisations of (n-1,n)-Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study higher-dimensional analogues of graph-theoretic trees within the class of pure n-simplicial complexes. Focusing on the case m = n-1 in Dewdney's (m, n)-tree framework, we introduce refined notions of path and circuit sequences that overcome the structural limitations of existing definitions. Using these refinements, we establish higher-dimensional analogues of the classical characterisations of trees in graphs, including equivalences based on connectivity, acyclicity, path uniqueness, and enumerative constraints. We further disprove two conjectures posed by Dewdney by constructing explicit counterexamples, and we formulate corrected versions that hold under additional necessary conditions in the case m = n-1. These results provide a structurally complete theory of (n-1, n)-trees, parallel to the classical theory of graph-theoretic trees.</description>

      <title>All Ordinals are Cop-Robber Ordinals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The game of cops and robbers, played on a fixed graph $G$, is a two-player game, where the cop and the robber (the players) take turns in moving to adjacent vertices. The game finishes if the cop lands on the robber's vertex. In that case we say that the cop wins. If the cop can always win, regardless of the starting positions, we say that $G$ is a cop-win graph.
  For a finite cop-win graph $G$ we can ask for the minimum number $n$ such that, regardless of the starting positions, the game will end in at most $n$ steps. This number is called the maximum capture time of $G$. By looking at finite paths, we see that any non-negative integer is the maximum capture time for a cop-win graph.
  What about infinite cop-win graphs? In this case, the notion of capture time is nicely generalised if one works with ordinals, and so the question becomes which ordinals can be the maximum capture time of a cop-win graph? These ordinals are called CR (Cop-Robber)-ordinals. In this paper we fully settle this by showing that all ordinals are CR-ordinals, answering a question of Bonato, Gordinowicz and Hahn.</description>

Abstract: For a bridgeless cubic graph $G$, $m_3(G)$ is the ratio of the maximum number of edges of $G$ covered by the union of $3$ perfect matchings to $|E(G)|$. We prove that for any $r\in [4/5, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cubic graphs $G$ such that $m_3(G) = r$. For any $r\in [9/10, 1)$, there exist infinitely many cyclically $4$-connected cubic graphs $G$ with $m_3(G) = r$.</description>

Abstract: The point-thickness $\theta'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of subsets into which the vertex set $V(G)$ of $G$ is partitioned such that each subset induces a planar subgraph. In this paper, we determine the point-thickness of complete multipartite graphs. As a special case, we also obtain the point-thickness of complete graphs.</description>

      <title>In Search of the Canonical Harmony for 12-TET</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is the specific structure of Western tonal harmony a physical inevitability derived from acoustics, or is it merely one solution among many in a purely algebraic landscape? In this paper, we strip away the physics of vibrating strings and treat harmony as the solution to a simple linear system within the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. By defining a harmonic system as a partitioning of a generator interval (the "Fifth") into two complementary thirds, we derive a complete classification of all possible harmonic universes in 12-Tone Equal Temperament. We show that every such system corresponds to a specific topological structure, visualized via its Levi graph.
  Our analysis reveals a counter-intuitive fact: the topological structure of standard Western harmony is not unique. It is one of exactly twelve mathematically isomorphic systems. However, we demonstrate that these shadows are not created equal. We identify a "privileged quartet" of systems that preserve the global connectivity of the Circle of Fifths. Furthermore, by invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we present a compelling argument that the most number-theoretically natural system in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is not the Western one, but a specific "alien" system defined by the partition $(9,4)$. This classification provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for neo-Riemannian theory and offers composers a precise "translation map" to explore syntactically familiar, yet sonically distinct, harmonic worlds.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study Neumaier Cayley graphs. First, we give a criterion for a Cayley graph to be a Neumaier graph with a spread given by the cosets of a subgroup. Further, we construct a new infinite family of Neumaier Cayley graphs of unbounded nexus. Finally, we provide an algorithm for enumerating Neumaier Cayley graphs and computational results obtained by this algorithm.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial formulas for symmetric Macdonald polynomials by superizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive new combinatorial formulas for symmetric Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ and integral Macdonald polynomials $J_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$, in terms of several new statistics and the major index for a partition $\lambda$. Compared to previous formulas, these new ones contain the fewest terms. Moreover, three existing formulas for symmetric Macdonald polynomials established by Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022), Corteel--Haglund--Mandelshtam--Mason--Williams (2022) and Mandelshtam (2025) are recovered.
  Our proof relies on a new statistic on super fillings, employing the superization formulas of Haglund--Haimain--Loehr (2005) and Ayyer--Mandelshtam--Martin (2023), together with our recent approach to modified Macdonald polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is shelf-shuffled exactly one time. One after the other a single card is drawn from the shuffled deck. The guesser makes has guess and the card is shown until no cards remain. We provide a distributional analysis of the number of correct guesses under the optimal strategy. We re-obtain the previously derived expectation and add a complete description of the distribution. We also obtain a central limit theorem for the number $n$ of cards tending to infinity. Furthermore, we discuss an unbalanced, biased shelf shuffle and show how to derive the extend our analysis, also adding the complete position matrix. Finally, a refined analysis of the number of correct guesses is carried out, distinguishing between pure luck guesses and certified correct guesses.</description>

      <title>A New Lower Bound for the Diagonal Poset Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two finite posets $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$, their Ramsey number, denoted by $R(\mathcal P,\mathcal Q)$, is defined to be the smallest integer $N$ such that any blue/red colouring of the vertices of the hypercube $Q_N$ has either a blue induced copy of $\mathcal P$, or a red induced copy of $\mathcal Q$.
  Axenovich and Walzer showed that, for fixed $\mathcal P$, $R(\mathcal P, Q_n)$ grows linearly with $n$. However, for the diagonal question, we do not even come close to knowing the order of growth of $R(Q_n,Q_n)$. The current upper bound is $R(Q_n,Q_n)\leq n^2-(1-o(1))n\log n$, due to Axenovich and Winter.
  What about lower bounds? It is trivial to see that $2n\leq R(Q_n,Q_n)$, but surprisingly, even an incremental improvement required significant work. Recently, an elegant probabilistic argument of Winter gave that, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\geq 2.02n$.
  In this paper we show that $R(Q_n,Q_n)\geq 2.7n+k$, where $k$ is a constant. Our current techniques might in principle show that in fact, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, for large enough $n$, $R(Q_n,Q_n)\geq (3-\epsilon)n$. Our methods exploit careful modifications of layered-colourings, for a large number of layers. These modifications are stronger than previous arguments as they are more constructive, rather than purely probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies of Minion Tests for PCSPs through Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02277v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified framework to study hierarchies of relaxations for Constraint Satisfaction Problems and their Promise variant. The idea is to split the description of a hierarchy into an algebraic part, depending on a minion capturing the "base level", and a geometric part - which we call tensorisation - inspired by multilinear algebra. We exploit the geometry of the tensor spaces arising from our construction to prove general properties of hierarchies. We identify certain classes of minions, which we call linear and conic, whose corresponding hierarchies have particularly fine features. We establish that the (combinatorial) bounded width, Sherali-Adams LP, affine IP, Sum-of-Squares SDP, and combined "LP + affine IP" hierarchies are all captured by this framework. In particular, in order to analyse the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy, we also characterise the solvability of the standard SDP relaxation through a new minion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Perfect State Transfer (PST) is a fundamental tool of quantum communication in a network. It is not easy to achieve in practice. The original idea of PST depends on the fundamentals of the continuous-time quantum walk. A path graph with at most three vertices allows PST based on continuous-time quantum walk. Based on the Markovian quantum walk, we introduce a significantly powerful method for PST in this article. We establish PST between the extreme vertices of a path graph of arbitrary length. Moreover, any pair of symmetric vertices in a path graph allows PST under Markovian quantum walks. We extend our investigations for the cycle graphs. The cycle graphs with more than $4$ vertices do not allow the PST based on the continuous-time quantum walk. In contrast, a cycle graph with $2m$ vertices exhibits PST based on Markovian quantum walk between the vertices $j$ and $j + m$ for $j = 0, 1, \dots (m - 1)$, where $m &gt; 0$ is an integer.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for checking equivalence of counting functions on free monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we propose a new algorithm for checking whether two counting functions on a free monoid $M_r$ of rank $r$ are equivalent modulo a bounded function. The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all ranks $r&gt;2$, but for $r=2$ it was estimated only to be $O(n^2)$. We apply a new approach based on the explicit basis expansion and summation of weighted rectangles, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time complexity $O(n)$ for any $r\geq 2$. We work in the multi-tape Turing machine model with non-constant-time arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Non-permutation phenomena in trivariate families over $\F_{2^m}$ and resolution of a conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing permutation polynomials over finite fields, particularly those with simple algebraic structure in multiple variables, is a fundamental problem with applications in cryptography and coding theory. Recently, Li and Kaleyski (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2024) generalized two sporadic quadratic APN permutations into infinite families of trivariate functions. Motivated by their work, we investigate conditions under which generalized trivariate functions fail to be permutations. We establish necessary conditions on coefficient parameters that prevent the permutation property, provide a complete computational classification for small field extensions, and prove general non-permutation results. As a key application of our algebraic geometry approach, we resolve the permutation part of a conjecture by Beierle, Carlet, Leander, and Perrin (Finite Fields Appl., 2022) regarding a related trivariate form. Specifically, we prove that for all odd characteristic-2 extension degrees $m \geq 23$, their function $C_u$ is not a permutation over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^3$ for any $u \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^*$, resolving the permutation part of their conjecture for sufficiently large fields.</description>

      <title>Advancing Uncertain Combinatorics through Graphization, Hyperization, and Uncertainization: Fuzzy, Neutrosophic, Soft, Rough, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorics studies how discrete objects can be counted, arranged, and combined under specified rules. Motivated by uncertainty in real-world data and decisions, modern set-theoretic formalisms such as fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, soft sets, and plithogenic sets have been developed. In particular, neutrosophic sets model uncertainty by assigning to each element degrees of truth, indeterminacy, and falsity. In parallel, these uncertainty frameworks are increasingly investigated in graphized and hyperized forms, where generalized graph models encompass classical graphs, hypergraphs, and higher-order "superhyper" structures; related hyper- and superhyper-concepts also arise beyond graph theory.
  This book (Edition 2.0) surveys and consolidates recent developments at the intersection of combinatorics, uncertain sets, uncertain graphs, and hyper/superhyper frameworks, while introducing several new graph and set concepts. As representative contributions, we extend graph-theoretic notions via Neutrosophic Oversets, Neutrosophic Undersets, Neutrosophic Offsets, and the Nonstandard Real Set. The second edition adds newly introduced concepts, corrects typographical issues, and re-examines mathematical consistency, aiming to serve as a compact reference and a source of inspiration for further research.</description>

      <title>CW-complexes and minimal Hilbert vector of graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I introduce a geometric interpretation of the set of standard graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras of codimension n and degree d: the standard locus, which is a subset of the projective space of degree d polynomials in n variables, and I characterize it. Under opportune hypothesis, I prove that the locus of full Perazzo polynomials is the union of the minimal dimensional irreducible components of the standard locus and it is a pure dimensional subset. On the other hand, I associate to any homogeneous polynomial a topological space, which is a CW-complex. Using all these sets, I prove that the Hilbert function restricted to the standard locus has minimal values on any irreducible component of the domain. I apply all this to the Full Perazzo Conjecture and I prove it.</description>

      <title>HNN extensions of free groups with equal associated subgroups of finite index: polynomial time word problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G=F\ast_\varphi t$ be an HNN extension of a free group $F$ with two equal associated normal subgroups $H_1 = H_2$ of finite index. We prove that the word problem in $G$ is decidable in polynomial time. This result extends to the case where the subgroups $H_1=H_2$ are not normal, provided that the isomorphism $\varphi:H_1\to H_2$ satisfies an additional condition described in Section 5.</description>

      <title>Weingarten calculus with virtual isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the Weingarten calculus by employing the notion of virtual isometries. Traditionally, Weingarten calculus provides explicit formulas for integrating polynomial functions over compact matrix groups with respect to the Haar measure, yet it faces limitations when evaluating high-degree integrals due to the non-invertibility of the associated matrices. We revisit these classical computations from a new perspective: by constructing Haar-distributed matrices as products of sequences of complex reflections, we derive new recursive structures for the Weingarten functions across different dimensions. This framework leads to two main results: (1) an explicit Weingarten calculus for complex reflections, yielding systematic moment computations for associated rank-one matrices, and (2) a novel convolution formula that connects Weingarten functions in dimension $n$ to those in dimension $n-1$, through the introduction of ascension functions in the symmetric group algebra. Our approach not only provides a unified treatment for unitary groups, but also sheds light on the algebraic and probabilistic aspects of high-degree integral computations. We present several examples and applications.</description>

      <title>Double-Cover-Based Analysis of the Bethe Permanent of Block-Structured Positive Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the permanent of a square matrix with non-negative entries. A tractable approximation is given by the so-called Bethe permanent that can be efficiently computed by running the sum-product algorithm on a suitable factor graph. While the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent is, in the worst case, upper and lower bounded by expressions that are exponentially far apart in the matrix size, in practice it is observed for many ensembles of matrices of interest that this ratio is strongly concentrated around some value that depends only on the matrix size. In this paper, for an ensemble of block-structured matrices where entries in a block take the same value, we numerically study the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent. It is observed that also for this ensemble the ratio is strongly concentrated around some value depending only on a few key parameters of the ensemble. We use graph-cover-based approaches to explain the reasons for this behavior and to quantify the observed value.</description>

      <title>121 Patchworked Curves of Degree Seven</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 121 real schemes, i.e., ambient isotopy classes, of smooth real plane algebraic curves of degree seven were classified by Viro (1984). By constructing one patchwork of the dilated triangle $7\cdot\Delta_2$ for each real scheme, we provide an explicit method for constructing polynomials realizing each real scheme. In particular, every real scheme of degree seven can be realized as a T-curve; this settles a question raised by Itenberg and Viro (1996).</description>

      <title>Almost all graphs are vertex-minor universal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Answering a question of Claudet, we prove that the uniformly random graph $G\sim \mathbb G(n, 1/2)$ is $\Omega(\sqrt n)$-vertex-minor universal with high probability. That is, for some constant $\alpha\approx 0.911$, any graph on any $\alpha\sqrt n$ specified vertices of $G$ can be obtained as a vertex-minor of $G$. This has direct implications for quantum communications networks: an $n$-vertex $k$-vertex-minor universal graph corresponds to an $n$-qubit $k$-stabilizer universal graph state, which has the property that one can induce any stabilizer state on any $k$ qubits using only local operations and classical communications.
  We further employ our methods in two other contexts. We obtain a bipartite pivot-minor version of our main result, and we use it to derive a universality statement for minors in random binary matroids. We also introduce the vertex-minor Ramsey number $R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k)$ to be the smallest value $n$ such that every $n$-vertex graph contains an independent set of size $k$ as a vertex-minor. Supported by our main result, we conjecture that $R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k)$ is polynomial in $k$. We prove $\Omega(k^2) \leq R_{\mathrm{vm}}(k) \leq 2^k - 1$.</description>
