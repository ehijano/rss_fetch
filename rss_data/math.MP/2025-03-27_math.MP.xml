      <title>Operator product expansions of derivative fields in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we initiate the study of operator product expansions (OPEs) for the sine-Gordon model. For simplicity, we focus on the model below the first threshold of collapse ($\beta&lt;4\pi$) and on the singular terms in OPEs of derivative-type fields $\partial \varphi$ and $\bar\partial\varphi$. We prove that compared to corresponding free field OPEs, the sine-Gordon OPEs develop logarithmic singularities and generate Wick ordered exponentials. Our approach for proving the OPEs relies heavily on Onsager-type inequalities and associated moment bounds for GFF correlation functions involving Wick ordered exponentials of the free field.</description>

      <title>On the non-integrability of driven-dissipative one-dimensional hard-core bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one dimension, in a closed system, the Tonks-Girardau gas is integrable even for finite temperatures and time-evolving systems. We address the question if it remains integrable once the system is no longer closed. We consider its lattice version under incoherent local pump and loss and show by using random matrix theory that the statistics of the complex spatial ratio indicates that the system is chaotic. Further, we show that the model belongs in the AI$^{\dagger}$ universality class of random matrices. In addition to this analysis, we investigate an emergent stripe-pattern in the spectrum and relate it to the dissipative parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>On the relativistic effect in the Dirac--Fock theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the error bound of the Dirac--Fock ground-state energy and the Hartree--Fock ground-state energy. This error bound is called the relativistic effect in quantum mechanics. We confirm that the relativistic effect in the Dirac--Fock ground-state energy is of the order $\cO(c^{-2})$ with $c$ being the speed of light. Furthermore, if the potential between electrons and nuclei is regular, we get the leading order relativistic correction, which comprises the sum of the mass-velocity term, the Darwin term, and the spin-orbit term. The proof is based on a delicate study of projections onto the positive eigenspace of some Dirac operators.
  To our knowledge, it is the first mathematical derivation of the leading order relativistic correction for nonlinear Dirac ground-state energies. Our method paves the way to study the relativistic effects in general nonlinear Dirac problems.</description>

      <title>Homotopy kinematic algebras at null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first formulation of a homotopy algebra adapted to a $1/r$ expansion near future null infinity ($\mathcal{I^+}$). Focusing on self-dual Yang-Mills theory in Bondi coordinates, we demonstrate that imposing the homotopy algebra relations naturally yields the physically consistent fall-off behavior of the fields near $\mathcal{I^+}$. Furthermore, we employ this framework to systematically construct kinematic algebras, uncovering novel infinite families of such algebras that satisfy the Jacobi identity on slices near $\mathcal{I^+}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish a Bochi-Ma\~n\'e type dichotomy in the space of two dimensional, nonnegative determinant matrix valued, locally constant linear cocycles over a Bernoulli or Markov shift. Moreover, we prove that Lebesgue almost every such cocycle has finite first Lyapunov exponent, which then implies a break in the regularity of the Lyapunov exponent, from analyticity to discontinuity.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}$ be the two-dimensional triangular lattice, and $\mathbb{Z}$ the one-dimensional integer lattice. Let $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{Z}$ denote the Cartesian product graph. Consider the Ising model defined on this graph with inverse temperature $\beta$ and external field $h$, and let $\beta_c$ be the critical inverse temperature when $h=0$. We prove that for each $\beta\in[0,\beta_c)$, there exists $h_c(\beta)&gt;0$ such that both a unique infinite $+$cluster and a unique infinite $-$cluster coexist whenever $|h|&lt;h_c(\beta)$. The same coexistence result also holds for the three-dimensional triangular lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a CLT for linear statistics of the form $\langle \mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\sigma} \rangle$ with quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds, where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is an observation from an exponential family with a quadratic form as its sufficient statistic, in the \enquote{high-temperature} regime. We apply our general result to random field Ising models with both discrete and continuous spins. To demonstrate the generality of our techniques, we apply our results to derive both quenched and annealed CLTs in various examples, which include Ising models on some graph ensembles of common interest (Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, regular, dense bipartite), and the Hopfield spin glass model. Our proofs rely on a combination of Stein's method of exchangeable pairs and Chevet type concentration inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an inequality restricting the evolution of states in quantum field theory with respect to the modular flow of a wedge, $\Delta^{is}$, for large $|s|$. Our bound is related to the quantum null energy condition, QNEC. In one interpretation, it can be seen as providing a ``chaos-bound'' $\le 2\pi$ on the Lyapunov exponent with respect to Rindler time, $s$. Mathematically, our inequality is a statement about half-sided modular inclusions of von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Higher-order exceptional points in a non-reciprocal waveguide beam splitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted significant interest because of their intriguing and useful properties, including exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of non-Hermitian operators become degenerate. In particular, quantum photonic systems with EPs exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations, which increases with the order of the EP. As a result, higher-order EPs hold significant potential for advanced sensing applications, but they are challenging to achieve due to stringent symmetry requirements. In this work, we study the dynamics of a generalized lossy waveguide beam splitter with asymmetric coupling by introducing non-reciprocity as a tunable parameter to achieve higher-order EPs even without dissipation. Using the Schwinger representation, we analytically derive eigenvalues and numerically demonstrate the formation of EPs. Moreover, we analyze the evolution of NOON states under activated non-reciprocity, highlighting its impact on quantum systems. Our results open new pathways for realizing higher-order EPs in non-reciprocal open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantisations of exactly solvable ghostly models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an exactly solvable two-dimensional Lorentzian coupled quantum system that in a certain parameter regime can be transformed to a higher time derivative theory (HTDT) with preserved symplectic structure. By transforming the system's Lagrangian, we explicitly map it onto the standard Pais-Uhlenbeck formulation, revealing a direct correspondence in their dynamical and Poisson bracket structures. We quantise the model in two alternative ways. First we derive the eigensystem of the Hamiltonian by solving the Schr\"odinger equation through an Ansatz that leads to a set of coupled three-term recurrence relations, that we solve exactly, identifying normalisable wavefunctions and their associated energy spectra. We compare our results with a Fock space construction, finding exact agreement. On the basis of the exact solutions we report several specific physical properties of the ghost model investigated with a focus on the localisation properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of locally loaded Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volterra's integral equations with local and nonlocal loads represent the novel class of integral equations that have attracted considerable attention in recent years. These equations are a generalisation of the classic Volterra integral equations, which were first introduced by Vito Volterra in the late 19th century. The loaded Volterra integral equations are characterised by the presence of a load which complicates the process of their theoretical and numerical study. Sometimes these equation are called the equations with ``frozen'' argument. The present work is devoted to the study of Volterra equations with locally loaded integral operators. The existence and uniquness theorems are proved. Among the main contributions is the collocation method for approximate solution of such equations based on the piecewise linear approximation. To confirm the convergence of the method, a number of numerical results for solving model problems are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the joint spectral properties of two coupled random matrices $H^{(1)}$ and $H^{(2)}$, which are either real symmetric or complex Hermitian. The entries of these matrices exhibit polynomially decaying correlations, both within each matrix and between them. Surprisingly, we find that under extremely weak decorrelation condition, permitting $H^{(1)}$ and $H^{(2)}$ to be almost fully correlated, the fluctuations of their individual eigenvalues in the bulk of the spectrum are still asymptotically independent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this decorrelation condition is optimal.</description>

      <title>Quantum umlaut information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Stochastic Particle System to the Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a system of integro-differential equations describing the evolution of cluster mass under mass exchange. The rate of exchange depends on the masses of the clusters involved and the mass being exchanged. This can be viewed as both a continuous generalization of the exchange-driven growth model and a coagulation-fragmentation equation that generalizes the continuous Smoluchowski equation.
  Starting from a Markov jump process that describes a finite stochastic interacting particle system with exchange dynamics, we prove the weak law of large numbers for this process for sublinearly growing kernels in the mean-field limit. We establish the tightness of the stochastic process on a measure-valued Skorokhod space induced by the $1$-Wasserstein metric, from which we deduce the existence of solutions to the (CGEDG) system. The solution is shown to have a Lebesgue density under suitable assumptions on the initial data. Moreover, within the class of solutions with density, we establish the uniqueness under slightly more restrictive conditions on the kernel.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of leapfrogging vortex rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of highly concentrated vorticity around rings in the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations is studied in a regime for which the leapfrogging dynamics predicted by Helmholtz is expected to occur. For a general class of initial data corresponding to vortex rings of sufficiently small thickness $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we prove weak and strong localization estimates for the vortex rings at positive times up to some time $T_0/|\ln \varepsilon|$ for fixed $T_0$, independent of $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we derive the motion law for the position of the rings on $[0,T_0/|\ln \varepsilon|]$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of a rigorous derivation of the leapfrogging motion up to times of order $|\ln\varepsilon|^{-1}$ for general initial data and the suitable scaling regime. The singular interaction of rings requires significant improvements of weak and strong localization estimates obtained in prior works. Our method is based on the combination of a new variational argument and a recently introduced double iterative procedure. Possibly due to natural filamentation of the vortex rings, which induces a lack of control of the support of the solution in the symmetry axis direction, our method does not allow to reach the time at which the rings have performed a full rotation around each other.</description>

      <title>Logging the conformal life of Ramanujan's $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1914, Ramanujan presented 17 infinite series for $1/\pi$. We examine the physics origin of these remarkable formulae by connecting them to 2D logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs) which arise in various contexts such as the fractional quantum hall effect, percolation and polymers. In light of the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the physics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and the conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel approximations for $1/\pi$. The rapid convergence of the Ramanujan series motivates us to take advantage of the crossing symmetry of the LCFT correlators to find new and efficient representations. To achieve this, we use the parametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed for string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in the new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire contribution to $1/\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting at a universal property of LCFTs. Additionally, the dispersive representation gives us a new handle on the double-lightcone limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry reductions of systems of two nonlinear partial differential equations are studied. We find ansatzes reducing system of partial differential equations to system of ordinary differential equations. The method is applied to system related to Korteweg -- de Vries (KdV) equation, and reaction-diffusion equations. We have also shown the possibility of constructing solution to system of non-evolutionary equations, which contains one or two arbitrary functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Keating and the second author of this paper devised a heuristic for predicting asymptotic formulas for moments of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. Their approach indicates how lower twisted moments of $\zeta(s)$ may be used to evaluate higher moments. In this paper, we present a rigorous random matrix theory analogue of their heuristic. To do this, we develop a notion of "twisted moment" of characteristic polynomials of matrices in the unitary group $U(N)$, and we prove several identities involving Schur polynomials. Our results may be viewed as a proof of concept of the heuristic for $\zeta(s)$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate normalized solutions for doubly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the real line with a defocusing standard nonlinearity and a focusing nonlinear point interaction of $\delta$--type at the origin. We provide a complete characterization of existence and uniqueness for normalized solutions and for energy ground states for every value of the nonlinearity powers. We show that the interplay between a defocusing standard and a focusing point nonlinearity gives rise to new phenomena with respect to those observed with single nonlinearities, standard combined nonlinearities, and combined focusing standard and pointwise nonlinearities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known Horner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Three-point correlation functions in the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda theory I: Reflection coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toda Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) form a family of 2d CFTs indexed by semisimple and complex Lie algebras. They are natural generalizations of the Liouville CFT in that they enjoy an enhanced level of symmetry encoded by W-algebras. These theories can be rigorously defined using a probabilistic framework that involves the consideration of correlated Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures.
  This document provides a first step towards the computation of a class of three-point correlation functions, that generalize the celebrated DOZZ formula and whose expressions were predicted in the physics literature by Fateev-Litvinov, within the probabilistic framework associated to the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda CFT. Namely this first article of a two-parts series is dedicated to the probabilistic derivation of the reflection coefficients of general Toda CFTs, which are essential building blocks in the understanding of Toda correlation functions.
  Along the computations of these reflection coefficients a new path decomposition for diffusion processes in Euclidean spaces, based on a suitable notion of minimum and that generalizes the celebrated one-dimensional result of Williams, will be unveiled. As a byproduct we describe the joint tail expansion of correlated Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos measures together with an asymptotic expansion of class one Whittaker functions.</description>

Abstract: In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, the entropy of a subsystem (smaller than half the system size) thermalizes if at long times, it is to leading order equal to the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem at the same energy. In this paper, we prove entropy thermalization for a nearly integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model initialized in a pure product state. The model is obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body interactions as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model.</description>

      <title>Higher equations of motion for boundary Liouville Conformal Field Theory from the Ward identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document we prove higher equations of motion at the level 2 for boundary Liouville Conformal Field Theory. As a corollary we present a new derivation of the Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov differential equations. Our method of proof does not rely on the mating of trees machinery but rather exploits the symmetries of the model through the Ward identities it satisfies.
  To do so we provide a definition of derivatives of the correlation functions with respect to a boundary insertion which was lacking in the existing literature, and introduce a new notion of descendant fields related to these Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Reformulating polarized radiative transfer for astrophysical applications (I). A formalism allowing non-local Magnus solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is diagnosed by solving the polarized radiative transfer problem for plasmas in Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE). A key challenge in multidimensional NLTE diagnosis is to integrate efficiently the radiative transfer equation (RTE), but current methods are local, i.e. limited to constant propagation matrices. This paper introduces a formalism for non-local integration of the RTE using the Magnus expansion. We begin by framing the problem in terms of rotations within the Lorentz / Poincare group (Stokes formalism), motivating the use of the Magnus expansion. By combining the latter with a highly detailed algebraic characterization of the propagation matrix, we derive a compact analytical evolution operator that supports arbitrary variations of the propagation matrix and allows to increasingly consider any order in the Magnus expansion. Additionally, we also reformulate the inhomogeneous part of the RTE, again using the Magnus expansion, and introducing the new concept of inhomogeneous evolution operator. This provides the first consistent, general, and non-local formal solution to the RTE that is furthermore efficient and separates integration from the algebraic formal solution. Our framework is verified analytically and computationally, leading to a new family of numerical radiative transfer methods and potential applications such as accelerating NLTE calculations. With minor adjustments, our results apply to other universal physical problems sharing the Lorentz / Poincare algebra in special relativity and electromagnetism.</description>

Abstract: We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
  In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou in that case.</description>

      <title>Quantized Area of the Schwarzschild Black Hole: A non-Hermitian Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, our aim is to link Bekenstein's quantized form of the area of the event horizon to the Hamiltonian of the non-Hermitian Swanson oscillator which is known to be $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetric. We achieve this by employing a similarity transformation that maps the non-Hermitian quantum system to a scaled harmonic oscillator. Our procedure is standard and well known. We, first of all, consider the unconstrained reduced Hamiltonian which is directly expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild mass and implies a periodic character for the conjugate momentum (which represents the asymptotic time coordinate), the period being the inverse Hawking temperature. This leads to the quantization of the event-horizon area in terms of the harmonic-oscillator levels. Within the framework of the Swanson oscillator, we proceed to derive novel expressions for the Hawking temperature and the black hole entropy. Notably, the logarithmic area-correction term -(1/2)$\ln$(area) is consistent with our results whereas -(3/2) $\ln$(area) is not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a quenched (trajectory-wise) linear response formula for random intermittent dynamical systems, consisting of Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps with varying parameters. This result complements recent annealed (averaged) results in the i.i.d setting. As an intermediate step, we show existence, uniqueness and statistical stability of the random absolutely continuous invariant probability measure (a.c.i.m.) for such non-uniformly expanding systems. Furthermore, we investigate sequential intermittent dynamical systems of this type and establish a linear response formula. Our arguments rely on the cone technique introduced by Baladi and Todd and further developed by Lepp{\"a}nen.
  We also demonstrate that sequential systems exhibit a subtle distinction from both random and autonomous settings: they may possess infinitely many sequential absolutely continuous equivariant densities. However, only one of these corresponds to an SRB state in the sense of Ruelle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates slant timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Minkowski 3-space $\mathbb{E}_{1}^{3}$. Using the symmetry of evolute curves, we derive a parametric formulation for skew timelike-ruled surfaces and establish conditions ensuring the coaxial alignment of the central normal with the ruling direction of the corresponding offset surface. The geometric properties are examined through the Blaschke and Darboux frames, leading to curvature characteristics and fundamental invariants. Special cases, such as timelike-developable and timelike-binormal surfaces, are analyzed with illustrative examples. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the differential geometry of timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Lorentzian space.</description>

      <title>On zeros of polynomials associated with Heun class equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sch\"afke and Schmidt established that the asymptotics of the coefficients of the local solution to some linear differential equation is related to global structures of solutions. The Heun class equations have the accessory parameters, and we investigate the polynomials whose variable is the accessory parameter which appears as the coefficients of the local solution. By calculating the zeros of the polynomials numerically, we obtain the data of the spectral related to the Heun class equations numerically.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A brief note on the G$_2$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the valence bond solid (VBS) state built of singlet pairs of fundamental representations and projected onto adjoint representations of the exceptional Lie group G$_2$. The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the VBS state, which constitutes the G$_2$ analog of the famous AKLT chain.</description>

      <title>Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of the massive point vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We show that the orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to a certain subspace $\mathcal{K}$ (called kinematic subspace) in the phase space yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations. We show that the massless dynamics is the zeroth-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and also derive a first-order correction to the zeroth-order massless dynamics. The massive dynamics near $\mathcal{K}$ is well approximated by the corresponding massless dynamics. In fact, our main result proves that the massive dynamics starting in $\mathcal{K}$ stays $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ for short time. On the other hand, the massive dynamics starting outside $\mathcal{K}$ exhibits an oscillatory initial layer due to its inertia and deviates significantly from the massless dynamics. We also perform an asymptotic analysis with a rescaled time to derive the inner approximation to capture the initial layer. The 0th-order inner equations are exactly solvable, and the 1st-order inner equations can be solved by quadrature. The combined inner approximation captures the initial oscillatory layer of the massive dynamics.</description>
