      <title>Scaling analysis for buoyant plumes over wildland fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the structure and geometric properties of a buoyant plume in cross-wind is critical for managing smoke hazards and improving disaster mitigation efforts. Plume features, such as the tilt angle, centerline trajectory, plume height, and curvature changes with height, are impacted by a range of forcing parameters, with the altered turbulence patterns induced by a vegetative canopy introducing an added layer of complexity. This study examines the effects of these parameters, reduced to a set of fewer dimensionless groups, on the plume centerline slope both, near the surface and in the far-field (bent-over phase). Results from a suite of large-eddy simulations in both canopy and no-canopy environments explore power-law dependencies between the slopes and key dimensionless groups describing (1) the relative strength of the buoyancy source to the ambient wind forcing and (2) the turbulence intensity within the plume relative to upstream. Near-surface slopes are an order of magnitude higher in the canopy cases owing to canopy drag. In the canopy cases, the near-surface plume slope increases markedly with increase in the dimensionless plume turbulence intensity, exhibiting a one-fourth power-law dependence. This effect is absent in the no-canopy case, reflecting spatial differences in the momentum-flux structure near the plume source between the two environments. Moreover, the canopy aerodynamic effects delay the transition of the plume from the rise phase into the far-field compared to the no-canopy cases. The transition height follows a one-fourth and one-third power-law dependence on group (1) in the canopy and no-canopy environments, respectively, with canopy effects becoming less prominent at higher buoyancy source strength. Our findings support the development of scaling laws for plume structures across varied environments and inform improved predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Investigating Buoyant Plume Dynamics Induced by Localized Fire-Simulated Heating over Plant Canopies Using LES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a buoyant plume with a plant canopy results in turbulent flow features distinct from those in a grassland environment. In this work, we model the turbulence dynamics of a buoyant plume in a homogeneous plant canopy with a crosswind using large-eddy simulations. As the plume interacts with the crosswind, we observe increased vorticity at the windward edge and tilted hair-pin-like vortical structures on the leeward side. Strong rotational cores, representing counter-rotating vortex pairs (CVPs), form as the flow twists and spirals into the leeward side of the buoyancy source from either side. Flow patterns aloft exhibit helical motions as the CVPs aloft propagate downstream, trailing the plume. We also simulate a no-canopy environment to facilitate comparison. The plume tilts less steeply near the source in the canopy case due to the canopy drag and its leeward side is marked by flow recirculation near the canopy top, which obstructs the upstream flow as it approaches. Moreover, the plume transition from the rise phase to the bent-over phase is delayed due to the canopy's aerodynamic effects and the oscillatory behavior of the far-field mean plume centerline is more damped. Additionally, in the canopy environment, there is downward momentum transfer primarily via ejections above the canopy and sweeps within the canopy space, upstream of the plume centerline. On the leeward side, counter-gradient motions play a significant role in transferring momentum away from the buoyancy source, with outward interactions being most dominant. Contrarily, in the no-canopy environment, counter-gradient motions near the surface are flanked upstream by an ejection-dominated region and downstream by a sweep-dominated region. Insights into the distinct plume behavior in canopy vs. no-canopy environments are vital for comparing with experiments and refining fire behavior or plume rise models.</description>

      <title>An Operational Deep Learning System for Satellite-Based High-Resolution Global Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12 hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg} (~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US. Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations into weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Statistical post-processing yields accurate probabilistic forecasts from Artificial Intelligence weather models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12672</link>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any modification to processing workflows, post-processing yields comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>
