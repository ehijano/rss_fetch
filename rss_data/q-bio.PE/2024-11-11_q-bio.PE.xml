      <title>A chemostat model with variable dilution rate due to biofilm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real life applications, a continuous culture bioreactor may cease to function properly due to bioclogging which is typically caused by the microbial overgrowth. This is a problem that has been largely overlooked in the chemostat modeling literature, despite the fact that a number of models explicitly accounted for biofilm development inside the bioreactor. In a typical chemostat model, the physical volume of the biofilm is considered negligible when compared to the volume of the fluid. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical consequences of removing such assumption. Specifically, we formulate a novel mathematical model of a chemostat where the increase of the biofilm volume occurs at the expense of the fluid volume of the bioreactor, and as a result the corresponding dilution rate increases reciprocally. We show that our model is well-posed and describes the bioreactor that can operate in three distinct types of dynamic regimes: the washout equilibrium, the coexistence equilibrium, or a transient towards the clogged state which is reached in finite time. We analyze the multiplicity and the stability of the corresponding equilibria. In particular, we delineate the parameter combinations for which the chemostat never clogs up and those for which it clogs up in finite time. We also derive criteria for microbial persistence and extinction. Finally, we present a numerical evidence that a multistable coexistence in the chemostat with variable dilution rate is feasible.</description>

      <title>Infection Pressure on Fish in Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of how to connect predictions by hydrodynamic models of how sea lice move in water to observable measures that count the number of lice on each fish in a cage in the water. This question is important for management and regulation of aquacultural practice that tries to maximise food production and minimise risk to the environment. We do this through a simple rule-based model of interaction between sea lice and caged fish. The model is simple: sea lice can attach and detach from a fish. The model has a novel feature, encoding what is known as a master equation producing a time-series of distributions of lice on fish that one might expect to find if a cage full of fish were placed at any given location. To demonstrate how this works, and to arrive at a rough estimate of the interaction rates, we fit a simplified version of the model with three free parameters to publicly available data about an experiment with sentinel cages in Loch Linnhe in Scotland. Our construction, coupled to the hydrodynamic models driven by surveillance data from industrial farms, quantifies the environmental impact as: what would the infection burden look like in a notional cage at any location and how does it change with time?</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in a three-strategy game combining snowdrift and stag hunt games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of a three-strategy game that combines snowdrift and stag hunt games. This game is motivated by an experimental study, which found that individual solution lowers cooperation levels. Agents adopting this option aim to address a problem to the extent necessary to remove negative impact on themselves, although they do not free ride on cooperation effort provided by others. This property of the individual solution is similar to that of option defection in the stag hunt. Thus, the role of the interplay of defection in the snowdrift game and individual solution was examined in this study. The well-mixed population has two asymptotically stable rest points, one wherein the individual solution occupies the population, and the other wherein cooperation and defection coexist. The interactions on a square lattice enlarge the parameter region wherein cooperation survives, and the three strategies often coexist. The scrutinization of the evolutionary process shows that multiple mechanisms lead to the coexistence of the three strategies depending on parameter values. Our analysis suggests that considering the individual solution adds complexity to the evolutionary process, which might contribute to our understanding on the evolution of cooperation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the periodic model introduced in [20] and disprove the conjectures on the number of periodic orbits the model can have. We rebuild the conjecture to prove that for periodic sequences of maps of any period, the number of non-zero periodic trajectories is bounded by two.</description>

      <title>Transformations to simplify phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolutionary relationships between species are typically represented in the biological literature by rooted phylogenetic trees. However, a tree fails to capture ancestral reticulate processes, such as the formation of hybrid species or lateral gene transfer events between lineages, and so the history of life is more accurately described by a rooted phylogenetic network. Nevertheless, phylogenetic networks may be complex and difficult to interpret, so biologists sometimes prefer a tree that summarises the central tree-like trend of evolution. In this paper, we formally investigate methods for transforming an arbitrary phylogenetic network into a tree (on the same set of leaves) and ask which ones (if any) satisfy a simple consistency condition. This consistency condition states that if we add additional species into a phylogenetic network (without otherwise changing this original network) then transforming this enlarged network into a rooted phylogenetic tree induces the same tree on the original set of species as transforming the original network. We show that the LSA (lowest stable ancestor) tree method satisfies this consistency property, whereas several other commonly used methods (and a new one we introduce) do not. We also briefly consider transformations that convert arbitrary phylogenetic networks to another simpler class, namely normal networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12873v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. Additionally we obtain the the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation.</description>
