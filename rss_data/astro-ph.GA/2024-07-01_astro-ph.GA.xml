      <title>MIDIS. Near-infrared rest-frame morphology of massive galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;5.5$ in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to decades of observations using HST, the structure of galaxies at redshift $z&gt;2$ has been widely studied in the rest-frame ultraviolet regime, which traces recent star formation from young stellar populations. But, we still have little information about the spatial distribution of the older, more evolved, stellar populations, constrained by the rest-frame infrared portion of galaxies' spectral energy distribution. We present the morphological characterization of a sample of 21 massive galaxies ($\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&gt;9.5$) at redshift $3&lt;z&lt;5.5$. These galaxies are observed as part of the GTO program MIDIS with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST. The deep MIRI 5.6~$\mu$m imaging allows us to characterize for the first time the rest-frame near-infrared structure of galaxies beyond cosmic noon, at higher redshifts than possible with NIRCam, tracing their older stellar populations. We derive the galaxies' non-parametric morphology and model the galaxies' light distribution with a S\'ersic component. We find that at $z&gt;3$ massive galaxies show a smooth distribution of their rest-infrared light, strongly supporting the increasing number of regular disk galaxies already in place at early epochs. On the contrary, the ultraviolet structure obtained from HST observations is generally more irregular, catching the most recent episodes of star formation. Importantly, we find a segregation of morphologies across cosmic time, having massive galaxies at redshift $z&gt;4$ later-type morphologies compared to $z\sim3$ galaxies. These findings suggest a transition phase in galaxy assembly and central mass build up already taking place at $z\sim3-4$. MIRI provides unique information about the structure of the mature stellar population of high-redshift galaxies, unveiling that massive galaxies beyond cosmic noon are prevalently compact disk galaxies with smooth mass distribution.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: A New Era of Emission-line Diagrams with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1--5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest-frame wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O_32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R_23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S_32); and HeI/Pa-gamma and [SIII]/Pa-gamma vs. [FeII]/Pa-beta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Thermal Structure &amp; The Origin of the Broad-Line Region, Torus, and Corona in Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent simulations have demonstrated the formation of 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks, qualitatively distinct from both classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks, as a natural consequence of fueling gas to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. We previously showed that the dynamical structure of said disks can be approximated by simple analytic similarity models. Here we study the thermal properties of these models over a wide range of physical scales and accretion rates. We show there are several characteristic zones: a dusty 'torus'-like region, a multi-phase neutral and then multi-phase ionized, broad line-emitting region interior to the sublimation radius, before finally a transition to a thermal accretion disk with a warm Comptonizing layer. The disks are strongly-flared with large scale heights, and reprocess and/or scatter an order-one fraction of the central disk emission. As a result, this simple accretion disk model predicts phenomena including the existence of a dusty torus and its covering factor, geometry, clumpiness, and dust temperatures; a broad-line-region (BLR) with its characteristic sizes and luminosities and ionization properties; extended scattering/reprocessing surfaces producing cooler disk continuum and apparently large observed disk sizes; and existence of warm Comptonizing layers and hard coronal gas. Remarkably, these properties emerge without our having to introduce new components or parameters: they are all part of the accretion flow if the disks are in the hyper-magnetized limit.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the in-situ and ex-situ stellar masses in nearby galaxies with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchical model of galaxy evolution suggests that the impact of mergers is substantial on the intricate processes that drive stellar assembly within a galaxy. However, accurately measuring the contribution of accretion to a galaxy's total stellar mass and its balance with in-situ star formation poses a persistent challenge, as it is neither directly observable nor easily inferred from observational properties. Here, we present theory-motivated predictions for the fraction of stellar mass originating from mergers in a statistically significant sample of nearby galaxies, using data from MaNGA. Employing a robust machine learning model trained on mock MaNGA analogs (MaNGIA) in turn obtained from a cosmological simulation (TNG50), we unveil that in-situ stellar mass dominates almost across the entire stellar mass spectrum (1e9Msun &lt; M* &lt; 1e12Msun). Only in more massive galaxies (M* &gt; 1e11Msun) does accreted mass become a substantial contributor, reaching up to 35-40% of the total stellar mass. Notably, the ex-situ stellar mass in the nearby universe exhibits significant dependence on galaxy characteristics, with higher accreted fractions favored by elliptical, quenched galaxies and slow rotators, as well as galaxies at the center of more massive dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The PARADIGM project I: How early merger histories shape the present-day sizes of Milky-Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The way in which mergers affect galaxy formation depends on both feedback processes, and on the geometry and strength of the mergers themselves. We introduce the PARADIGM project, where we study the response of a simulated Milky-Way-mass galaxy forming in a cosmological setting to differing merger histories, using genetically modified initial conditions. Each initial condition is simulated with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG codes. While VINTERGATAN has been developed with an emphasis on resolving the cold interstellar medium, IllustrisTNG uses a subgrid two-phase model and consequently scales to large volume simulations, making them ideal to examine complementary views on how merger histories and feedback interact. Our genetic modifications alter the mass ratio of an important $z \approx 2$ merger while maintaining the halo's $z=0$ mass. Whether simulated with VINTERGATAN or IllustrisTNG, smaller mass ratios for this early merger result in larger galaxies at $z=0$, due to a greater build up of a kinematically cold disc. We conclude that such broad trends are robustly reproducible; however, the normalization of the resulting stellar sizes is substantially different in the two codes (ranging between $0.5-1.7\ \rm{kpc}$ for VINTERGATAN but $1.3-7.0\ \rm{kpc}$ for IllustrisTNG). The VINTERGATAN galaxies systematically form stars earlier, leading to a larger bulge component. Despite the difference in size normalization, both simulation suites lie on the observed size-mass relation for their respective morphological types. In light of these results, we discuss the interplay between internal processes and large scale gravitational interactions and gas accretion, and how the two galaxy models converge on similar emergent trends but along different evolutionary pathways.</description>

      <title>Zooming in on the Circumgalactic Medium with GIBLE: Tracing the Origin and Evolution of Cold Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the GIBLE suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies with additional super-Lagrangian refinement in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to quantify the origin and evolution of CGM cold gas clouds. The origin of $z$\,$=$\,$0$ clouds can be traced back to recent ($\lesssim$\,$2$\,Gyr) outflows from the central galaxy ($\sim$\,45\,$\%$), condensation out of the hot phase of the CGM in the same time frame ($\sim$\,45\,$\%$), and to a lesser degree to satellite galaxies ($\lesssim$\,5\,$\%$). We find that in-situ condensation results from rapid cooling around local over-densities primarily seeded by the dissolution of the previous generation of clouds into the hot halo. About $\lesssim$\,10\,$\%$ of the cloud population is long lived, with their progenitors having already assembled $\sim$\,$2$\,Gyr ago. Collective cloud-cloud dynamics are crucial to their evolution, with coalescence and fragmentation events occurring frequently ($\gtrsim$\,20\,Gyr$^{-1}$). These interactions are modulated by non-vanishing pressure imbalances between clouds and their interface layers. The gas content of clouds is in a constant state of flux, with clouds and their surroundings exchanging mass at a rate of \mbox{$\gtrsim$\,$10^3$\,M$_\odot$\,Myr$^{-1}$}, depending on cloud relative velocity and interface vorticity. Furthermore, we find that a net magnetic tension force acting against the density gradient is capable of inhibiting cloud-background mixing. Our results show that capturing the distinct origins of cool CGM clouds, together with their physical evolution, requires high-resolution, cosmological galaxy formation simulations with both stellar and supermassive black hole feedback-driven outflows.</description>

      <title>A slightly oblate dark matter halo revealed by a retrograde precessing Galactic disk warp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the dark matter (DM) halo is key to understanding the hierarchical formation of the Galaxy. Despite extensive efforts in recent decades, however, its shape remains a matter of debate, with suggestions ranging from strongly oblate to prolate. Here, we present a new constraint on its present shape by directly measuring the evolution of the Galactic disk warp with time, as traced by accurate distance estimates and precise age determinations for about 2,600 classical Cepheids. We show that the Galactic warp is mildly precessing in a retrograde direction at a rate of $\omega = -2.1 \pm 0.5 ({\rm statistical}) \pm 0.6 ({\rm systematic})$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ for the outer disk over the Galactocentric radius [$7.5, 25$] kpc, decreasing with radius. This constrains the shape of the DM halo to be slightly oblate with a flattening (minor axis to major axis ratio) in the range $0.84 \le q_{\Phi} \le 0.96$. Given the young nature of the disk warp traced by Cepheids (less than 200 Myr), our approach directly measures the shape of the present-day DM halo. This measurement, combined with other measurements from older tracers, could provide vital constraints on the evolution of the DM halo and the assembly history of the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution timescales for the triple supermassive black hole system in NGC 6240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the available observational data from the literature, we analysed the dynamics of the NGC 6240 galaxy central supermassive black hole (SMBH) system. For the dynamical modelling of this triple SBMH system, we used the massively parallel and GPU accelerated phi-GPU direct summation N-body code. Following a long-timescale modelling of the triple system, we carried out a very detailed time output analysis of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations for the black holes. According to our Newtonian simulation results, for all models and randomisations, the bound system from S1+S2 components formed at ~3.6 Myr. The formation of the bound hierarchical triple system S+N occurred at ~18 Myr. Over the course of these Newtonian simulations of the evolution of the triple SMBH system and the surrounding environment in NGC 6240, ZLK oscillations were detected (in most cases) for the binary components. The inclination angle between the orbital angular momentum of binary components aptly coincides with the theoretical calculations of the ZLK mechanism. In our set of randomised 15 Newtonian $N$-body dynamical galaxy models in 13 systems, we were able to detect a ZLK mechanism. In contrast, our extra few-body post-Newtonian runs (for one randomisation case) show it is only for the large inner binary initial eccentricity (in our case &gt;0.9 that we are able to observe the possibility of the inner binary merging, due to the post-Newtonian energy radiation effects. For the lower eccentricity cases, the test runs show no sign of possible merging or any ZLK oscillations in the system.</description>

      <title>Major merger fraction along the massive galaxy quenching channel at 0.2$&lt;z&lt;$0.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the major merger fraction along the massive galaxy quenching channel (traced with rest-frame $\mathrm{NUV}-r$ color) at $z=$ 0.2-0.7, aiming to examine the Cosmic Web Detachment (CWD) scenario of galaxy quenching. In this scenario, the major merger fraction is expected to be high in green valley galaxies as compared with those in star-forming and quiescent galaxies of similar stellar mass. We used photometry in the E-COSMOS field to select 1491 (2334) massive ($M_\ast&gt;10^{9.5}$ $M_\odot$) galaxies with $m_i&lt;22$ mag ($m_z&lt;22$ mag) at $z=$ 0.2-0.4 ($z=$ 0.4-0.7) in the rest-frame color range of $0.8&lt;r-K_s&lt;1.3$. We define a major galaxy-galaxy merger as a galaxy pair of comparable angular size and luminosity with tidal tails or bridges, and we identified such major mergers through visual inspection of Subaru-HSC-SSP PDR 2 $i$- and $z$-band images. We classify 92 (123) galaxies as major merger galaxies at $z=$ 0.2-0.4 ($z=$ 0.4-0.7). The resulting major merger fraction is 5%-6% and this fraction does not change with galaxy color along the massive galaxy quenching channel. The result is not consistent with the expectation based of CWD scenario as the dominant mechanism of massive galaxy quenching. However, there are some caveats such as (i) the mergers that cause quenching may lose their visible merger signatures rapidly before they enter the Green Valley, (ii) our method may not trace the cosmic web sufficiently well, and (iii) because of our mass limit, most of the galaxies in our sample may have already experienced CWD events at higher redshifts than those studied here. Further studies with deeper data are desirable in the future.</description>

      <title>Gaia dr3 reveals the complex dynamical evolution within star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Star clusters, composed of stars born from the same molecular cloud, serve as invaluable natural laboratories for understanding the fundamental processes governing stellar formation and evolution. Aims: This study aims to investigate correlations between the Mean Interdistance ($\bar{D_{i}}$), Mean Closest Interdistance ($\bar{D_{c}}$) and Median Weighted Central Interdistance ($\bar{D_{cc}}$) with the age of star clusters, examining their evolutionary trends and assessing the robustness of these quantities as possible age indicators. Methods: We selected a sample of open clusters in the solar region and with a representative number of members (e.g. well populated and without outliers). The interdistances are derived from the spatial distribution of member stars within a cluster. Their evolution over time allows us to use them as an age indicators for star clusters. Results: Our investigation reveals a high-significant correlation between the interdistances and cluster age. Considering the full sample of clusters between 7 and 9 kpc, the relationship is very broad. This is due to uncertainties in parallax, which increase with increasing distance. In particular, we must limit the sample to a maximum distance from the Sun of about 200 pc to avoid artificial effects on cluster shape and on the spatial distribution of their stars along the line of sight. Conclusions: By conservatively restraining the distance to a maximum of $\sim$200 pc, we have established a relationship between the interdistances and the age of the clusters. In our sample, the relationship is mainly driven by the internal expansion of the clusters, and is marginally affected by external perturbative effects. Such relation might enhance our comprehension of cluster dynamics and might be used to derive cluster dynamical ages.</description>

      <title>Central oxygen abundances in the spiral galaxies of the MaNGA survey: Galaxies with central starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether there are deviations of the local central oxygen abundances in spiral galaxies from the general metallicity gradients. We compare the values of the central intersect oxygen abundances estimated from the metallicity gradient based on the integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey and the local central oxygen abundances obtained from the single-fibre observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Special attention is placed on galaxies with recent and currently ongoing central starbursts (cSB galaxies). We selected a sample of 30 cSB galaxies from our total sample of 381 MaNGA galaxies, using the decrease in the Dn4000 index (a stellar age indicator) in the circumnuclear region as the selection criterion. We found that the local central oxygen abundances follow the general metallicity gradients in the galaxies well and agree with the central intersect abundances within uncertainties of the central abundances determinations. Starbursts in the centres of cSB galaxies do not produce noticeable oxygen enrichments. The central starbursts imply that an appreciable amount of gas is present at the centres of cSB galaxies. The gas at the centre of galaxy can serve not only as a raw material for the star formation, but also as a fuel for the activity of the galactic nucleus (AGN). We found that the AGN is the main source of the ionising radiation at the centres of six cSB galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Inferring intrahalo light from stellar kinematics -- A deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00838</link>

Abstract: Disentangling the stellar population in the central galaxy from the intrahalo light can help us shed light on the formation history of the host halo, as the properties of the stellar components are expected to retain traces of its formation history. Many approaches are adopted, depending on different physical assumptions (e.g. the light profile, chemical composition, and kinematical differences) and on whether the full six-dimensional phase-space information is known (much like in simulations) or whether one analyses projected quantities (i.e. observations). This paper paves the way for a new approach to bridge the gap between observational and simulation methods. We propose the use of projected kinematical information from stars in simulations in combination with deep learning to create a robust method for identifying intrahalo light in observational data to enhance understanding and consistency in studying the process of galaxy formation. Using a U-Net, we developed a methodology for predicting these contributions from a sample of mock images from hydrodynamical simulations to train, validate and test the network. Reinforced training (Attention U-Net) was used to improve the first results, as the innermost central regions of the mock images consistently overestimate the stellar intrahalo contribution. Our work shows that adequate training over a representative sample of mock images can lead to good predictions of the intrahalo light distribution. The model is mildly dependent on the training size and its predictions are less accurate when applied to mock images from different simulations. However, the main features (spatial scales and gradients of the stellar fractions) are recovered for all tests. While the method presented here should be considered as a proof of concept, future work is required to enable the application of the proposed model to observational data.</description>

      <title>Ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows detected in a high-redshift radio galaxy: [C II] observations of TN J0924$-$2201 at $z=5.174$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line and the underlying continuum emission of TN J0924$-$2201, which is one of the most distant known radio galaxies at $z&gt;5$. The [C II] line and 1-mm continuum emission are detected at the host galaxy. The systemic redshift derived from the [C II] line is $z_{\rm [C II]}=5.1736\pm0.0002$, indicating that the Ly$\alpha$ line is redshifted by a velocity of $1035\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, marking the largest velocity offset between the [C II] and Ly$\alpha$ lines recorded at $z&gt;5$ to date. In the central region of the host galaxy, we identified a redshifted substructure of [C II] with a velocity of $702\pm17$ km s$^{-1}$, which is close to the CIV line with a velocity of $500\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$. The position and the velocity offsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with the large velocity offset of Ly$\alpha$. The non-detection of [C II] and dust emission from the three CO(1--0)-detected companions indicates their different nature compared to dwarf galaxies based on the photodissociation region model. Given their large velocity of $\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$, outflowing molecular clouds induced by the AGN is the most plausible interpretation, and they may exceed the escape velocity of a $10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$ halo. These results suggest that TN J0924$-$2201, with the ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows, is in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive galaxy in an overdense region in the early universe. A dusty HI absorber at the host galaxy is an alternative interpretation.</description>

      <title>Direct observational evidence of multi-epoch massive star formation in G24.47+0.49</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using new continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey and archival VLA, 4.86 GHz data, we present direct observational evidence of hierarchical triggering relating three epochs of massive star formation in a ring-like H II region, G24.47+0.49. We find from radio flux analysis that it is excited by a massive star(s) of spectral type O8.5V-O8V from the first epoch of star formation. The swept-up ionized ring structure shows evidence of secondary collapse, and within this ring a burst of massive star formation is observed in different evolutionary phases, which constitutes the second epoch. ATOMS spectral line (e.g., HCO$^+$(1-0)) observations reveal an outer concentric molecular gas ring expanding at a velocity of $\sim$ 9 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$, constituting the direct and unambiguous detection of an expanding molecular ring. It harbors twelve dense molecular cores with surface mass density greater than 0.05 $\rm g\,cm^{-2}$, a threshold typical of massive star formation. Half of them are found to be subvirial, and thus in gravitational collapse, making them third epoch of potential massive star-forming sites.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the rotational spectrum of CH$_3$$^{17}$OH and its tentative detection toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methanol is an abundant molecule in space. The column density of CH$_3^{18}$OH is in some star-forming regions so high that the search for CH$_3^{17}$OH is promising. But only very few transition frequencies of CH$_3^{17}$OH with a microwave accuracy have been published thus far. We recorded the rotational spectrum of CH$_3^{17}$OH between 38 and 1095 GHz employing a methanol sample enriched in $^{17}$O to 20\%. A torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method was employed to fit the data, as in our previous studies. We searched for rotational transitions of CH$_3^{17}$OH in the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N). The observed spectra were modeled under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The assignments cover $0 \le J \le 45$, $K_a \le 16$, and mainly the $v_ t = 0$ and 1 torsional states. The Hamiltonian model describes our data well. The model was applied to derive a line list for radio-astronomical observations. We report a tentative detection of CH$_3^{17}$OH along with secure detections of the more abundant isotopologs of methanol toward Sgr B2(N2b). The derived column densities yield isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 25, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = 240, and $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O = 3.3, which are consistent with values found earlier for other molecules in Sgr B2. The agreement between the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O isotopic ratio that we obtained for methanol and the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O ratios reported in the past for other molecules in Sgr B2(N) strongly supports our tentative interstellar identification of CH$_3^{17}$OH. The accuracy of the derived line list is sufficient for further radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog toward other star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Properties of supernova remnants in SIGNALS galaxies -- I . NGC 6822 and M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially resolved study of the kinematical properties of known supernova remnants (SNRs) in the nearest galaxies of the SIGNALS survey, namely NGC 6822 (one object) and M33 (163 objects), based on data obtained with the SITELLE Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (iFTS) at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The purpose of this paper is to provide a better scheme of identification for extragalactic SNRs and, in particular, to distinguish between HII regions and SNRs. For that we have used diagrams which involve both the [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). We also introduce a new parameter, $\xi = {[SII] \over H\alpha} \times \sigma$, which enhances still the contrast between SNRs and the rest of the ionised gas. More than 90\% of the SNRs in our entire sample show an integrated [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio larger than the canonical value (0.4). 86\% of the SNRs present in our field show a significant velocity dispersion. The spectral resolution of our observations allows us to observe the complex velocity structure of some SNRs.</description>

      <title>Herschel Gould Belt Survey in Taurus. II: A census of dense cores and filaments in the TMC1 region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of dense cores and filaments in a $3.8^{\circ}\times2.4^{\circ}$ field around the TMC1 region of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The catalogue was created using photometric data from the Herschel SPIRE and PACS instruments in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m, and 500 $\mu$m continuum bands. Extended structure in the region was reconstructed from a Herschel column density map. Power spectra and PDFs of this structure are presented. The PDF splits into log-normal and power-law forms, with the high-density power-law component associated primarily with the central part of TMC1. The total mass in the mapped region is 2000 M$_\odot$, of which 34% is above an extinction of AV $\sim$ 3 mag -- a level that appears as a break in the PDF and as the minimum column density at which dense cores are found. A total of 35 dense filaments were extracted from the column density map. These have a characteristic FWHM width of 0.07 pc, but the TMC1 filament itself has a mean FWHM of $\sim$ 0.13 pc. The thermally supercritical filaments in the region are aligned orthogonal to the prevailing magnetic field direction. Derived properties for the supercritical TMC1 filament support the scenario of it being relatively young. A catalogue of 44 robust and candidate prestellar cores is created and is assessed to be complete down to 0.1 M$_\odot$. The combined prestellar CMF for the TMC1 and L1495 regions is well fit by a single log-normal distribution and is comparable to the standard IMF.</description>

      <title>Average Star Formation Parameters in the Local Volume of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the fluxes of 1400 nearby galaxies observed in far ultraviolet (${\rm FUV}$) and in the H$\alpha$ line, we determined the global star formation rate per unit Universe volume, $j_{\rm SFR}=(1.34\pm0.16) 10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. With the current star formation rate (SFR), ($65\pm4)$% of the observed stellar mass is reproduced in the cosmological time of 13.8 billion years. The neutral gas reserves in the Local Volume with a radius of 11 Mpc will facilitate the current SFR on a scale of approximately another 5 billion years.</description>

      <title>The radio properties of z&gt;3.5 quasars: Are most high-redshift radio-loud active galactic nuclei obscured?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the radio properties of powerful (rest-frame luminosity $\gtrsim10^{28}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 500 MHz) high-redshift (z &gt; 3.5) quasars. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of radio-loud sources at the epoch when they reach the highest space density. We selected 29 radio-loud quasars at low radio frequencies (76 MHz). Their radio spectra, covering the range from 76 MHz to 5 GHz, are generally well reproduced by a single power law. We created samples that were matched in radio luminosity at lower redshift (from z~1.3 to z~2.8) to investigate any spectral evolution. We find that the fraction of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) strongly increases with redshift (from ~8% at z=1.2 to ~45% at z&gt;3.5). This effect is also observed in quasars with lower luminosities (down to $\sim 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). The increase in the fraction of FSRQs with redshift corresponds to a decrease in the steep-spectrum radio quasars. This result can be explained, assuming that the beaming factor and the slope of the luminosity function do not change with redshift, if high-redshift radio-loud sources can be recognized as quasars only when they are seen at a small viewing angle ($\lesssim 25^\circ$), while most of them, about 90%, are obscured in the UV and optical bands. We also found a trend for the size of radio sources to decrease with increasing redshift. Because projection effects are insufficient to cause this trend, we suggest that the large amount of gas causing the nuclear obscuration also hampers the growth of the more distant sources.</description>

      <title>First detection of the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ methanol maser transitions at $J=7$ and $10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class\,I methanol masers provide sensitive information about the shocked environment around star-forming regions. Among the brightest Class~I methanol masers, we have those in the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series, currently reported for the $J=4-9$ transitions, with the only exception being the $J=7$ one at 181.295~GHz, and never expanded to higher $J$ transitions. We aim to search for population inversion in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transition lines at 181.295 and 326.961\,GHz, respectively, and also extend the number of known low-mass star-forming sources harboring Class\,I methanol masers. We employed the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12\,m telescope to survey low-mass Galactic sources, focusing on methanol emission lines. We conducted rotation diagrams for all sources with detected $J=7$ methanol line transitions, while employing radiative transfer modeling (both in and out of local thermodynamic equilibrium) to characterize methanol excitation conditions in detail for one specific source with detected masers. We have detected the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transitions in six out of nineteen sources. Among them, we firmly determined the $10_{-1}\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ maser nature in CARMA\,7, L1641N, NGC\,2024, and Serpens FIRS, and we claim for the presence of inverted population emission in the $7_{-1}\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ line toward CARMA\,7 and L1641N. This represents the first report of methanol maser emission in these particular transitions. Our study supports previous works indicating that conditions for Class\,I methanol maser emission are satisfied in low-mass star-forming regions and expands the range of detectable frequencies toward higher values.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration III.: Calcium Triplet Metallicities for RR Lyrae Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars are excellent tracers of stellar populations for old, metal-poor components in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group. Their luminosities have a metallicity-dependence, but determining spectroscopic [Fe/H] metallicities for RR Lyrae stars, especially at distances outside the solar neighbourhood, is challenging. Using 40 RRLs with metallicities derived from both Fe(II) and Fe(I) abundances, we verify the calibration between the [Fe/H] of RR Lyrae stars from the Calcium triplet. Our calibration is applied to all RR Lyrae stars with Gaia RVS spectra in Gaia DR3 as well as to 80 stars in the inner Galaxy from the BRAVA-RR survey. The co-added Gaia RVS RR Lyrae spectra provide RR Lyrae metallicities with an uncertainty of 0.25~dex, which is a factor of two improvement over the Gaia photometric RR Lyrae metallicities. Within our Galactic bulge RR Lyrae star sample, we find a dominant fraction with low energies without a prominent rotating component. Due to the large fraction of such stars, we interpret these stars as belonging to the $in-situ$ metal-poor Galactic bulge component, although we can not rule out that a fraction of these belong to an ancient accretion event such as Kraken/Heracles.</description>

      <title>Universal Basic Mass Density inside Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a universal basic mass density and a universal basic metric inside dark matter halos in the framework of Einstein equations providing an analytical ground for learning about dark matter. In a previous work the authors have proposed a simplified model for galaxies: a Schwarzschild black hole (that contains all the baryonic matter of the galaxy) immersed inside a dark matter halo. The solution solved the Einstein equations perturbatively and successfully gave the flat rotation curve and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, the two signatures of spiral galaxies. In this work we take the black hole mass (the baryonic mass) of the solution to be zero in order to focus our study on the dark matter halo exclusively. Among the results (1) is the prediction of a universal basic mass density of dark matter, $\rho=a_0/2\pi G r$, where $a_0\approx 2.8 \times 10^{-11} \ m/s^2$ is a universal constant whose value was deduced from observations, (2) we show that the mass and velocity curve of the dark halo agree excellently with observational data at intermediate distances where the baryonic matter contribution is negligible, (3) we show that the constant $a_0$ is the origin of the constant surface density of dark matter and the origin of the scale-radius/scale-density scaling relation of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile (4) we show how the inclusion of baryonic matter in our model solves the core-cusp problem.</description>

      <title>The variable stars in the field of the bulge cluster NGC 6558</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We made a survey of the variable stars in a $13.2 \times 13.2$ arcmin$^2$ centered on the field of the Galactic bulge cluster NGC 6558. A total of 78 variables was found in the field of the cluster. Many of these variables are included in the Catalogue of Variable Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters (Clement et al. 2001), OGLE or Gaia-DR3 data releases. A membership analysis based on the proper motions of Gaia-DR3 revealed that many of these variables do not belong to the cluster. We employed the data from the aforementioned surveys and our own data in the VI photometric system to estimate the periods, which along with the light curves morphology and position in a deferentially dereddened colour-magnitude diagram(CMD), help classifying the variable types. Two new member variables were found; an eclipsing binary (V18) and a semi-regular SR/L (V19). In the end we conclude that only 9 variables are likely cluster members. Member variables were used to discuss the mean metallicity and distance of the parental cluster and find the average values.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantitative spectral analysis of the extreme nitrogen-enhanced supergiant HD 93840 (BN1 Ib) at an intermediate galactic latitude. Based on an optical high-resolution spectrum and complementary ultraviolet and infrared (spectro-)photometry, in addition to Gaia data, we carried out a full characterisation of the star's properties. We used both hydrostatic and unified (photosphere+wind) model atmospheres that account for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium. A highly unusual surface CNO-mixing signature and a marked stellar overluminosity compared to the mass imply a binary channel for the star's past evolution. The kinematics shows that it has reached its current position above the Galactic plane as a runaway star, likely ejected by the supernova explosion of its former companion star. Its current bulk composition, with a notably increased mean molecular weight due to core He- and progressed shell H-burning, suggests an advanced evolutionary stage. It is poised to yield a rare core-collapse supernova of a blue supergiant about ten OB star population scale heights above the Galactic disk relatively soon, contributing to the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.</description>

      <title>AtLAST Science Overview Report</title>

Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>

      <title>Straightening the Ruler: Field-Level Inference of the BAO Scale with LEFTfield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current inferences of the BAO scale from galaxy clustering employ a reconstruction technique at fixed cosmology and bias parameters. Here, we present the first consistent joint Bayesian inference of the isotropic BAO scale, jointly varying the initial conditions as well as all bias coefficients, based on the EFT-based field-level forward model $\texttt{LEFTfield}$. We apply this analysis to mock data generated with a much higher cutoff (resolution), resulting in a significant model mismatch between mock data and the model used in the inference. We demonstrate that the remaining systematic bias in the BAO scale is below 2% for all data considered and below 1% when Eulerian bias is used for inference. Furthermore, we find that the inferred error on the BAO scale is up to 1.6 times smaller compared to that from a replication of the standard power-spectrum reconstruction approach, using the same scales as in the field-level inference, with the improvement growing towards smaller scales (higher $k$). Thus, a field-level approach to BAO not only allows for a consistent inference of the BAO scale, but promises to achieve more precise measurements on the same data as well.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution models: the role of type Ia supernovae in the $\alpha$-elements over Iron relative abundances and their variations in time and space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), mainly the Delay Time Distributions (DTDs) determined by the binary systems, and the yields of elements created by different explosion mechanisms, are studied by using the MulChem chemical evolution model applied to our Galaxy. We explored 15 DTDs and 12 tables of elemental yields produced by different SN Ia explosion mechanisms, doing a total of 180 models. Chemical abundances for $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca) and Fe derived from these models are compared with recent solar region observational data of $\alpha$-elements over Fe relative abundances, [X/Fe], as a function of [Fe/H] and age. A multidimensional maximum likelihood analysis shows that 52 models are able to fit all these datasets simultaneously, considering the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. The combination of STROLG1 DTD and LN20181 SN Ia yields provides the best fit. The exponential model with very prompt events is a possible DTD, but a combination of several channels is more probable. The SN Ia yields that include MCh or Near MCh correspond to 39 (75%) of the 52 best models. Regarding the DTD, 31 (60%) of the 52 most probable models correspond to the SD scenario, while the remaining 21 (40%) are based on the DD scenario. Our results also show that the relatively large dispersion of the observational data may be explained by the stellar migration from other radial regions, and/or perhaps a combination of DTDs and explosion channels.</description>

      <title>HYACINTH: HYdrogen And Carbon chemistry in the INTerstellar medium in Hydro simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We present a new sub-grid model, HYACINTH -- HYdrogen And Carbon chemistry in the INTerstellar medium in Hydro simulations -- for computing the non-equilibrium abundances of ${\rm H_2}$ and its carbon-based tracers, namely ${\rm CO}$, ${\rm C}$, and ${\rm C^+}$, in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Methods. The model accounts for the unresolved density structure in simulations using a variable probability distribution function of sub-grid densities and a temperature-density relation. Included is a simplified chemical network that has been tailored for hydrogen and carbon chemistry within molecular clouds and easily integrated into large-scale simulations with minimal computational overhead. As an example, we applied HYACINTH to a simulated galaxy at redshift $z \sim 2.5$ in post-processing and compared the resulting abundances with observations. Results. The chemical predictions from HYACINTH are in reasonable agreement with high-resolution molecular-cloud simulations at different metallicities. By post-processing a galaxy simulation with HYACINTH, we reproduced the $\rm H\,I-{\rm H_2}$ transition as a function of the hydrogen column density $N_{\rm H}$ for both Milky-Way-like and Large-Magellanic-Cloud-like conditions. Column density maps reveal that ${\rm CO}$ is concentrated in the peaks of the ${\rm H_2}$ distribution, while atomic carbon more broadly traces the bulk of ${\rm H_2}$ in our post-processed galaxy. Based on both the column density maps and the surface density profiles of the different gas species in the post-processed galaxy, we find that ${\rm C^+}$ maintains a substantially high surface density out to $\sim 10 \, \rm kpc$ as opposed to other components that exhibit a higher central concentration. This is similar to the extended $[\rm C\,II]$ emission found in some recent observations at high redshifts.</description>

Abstract: The Gaia mission has revolutionized our view of the Milky Way and its satellite citizens. The field of Galactic Archaeology has been piecing together the formation and evolution of the Galaxy for decades, and we have made great strides, with often limited data, towards discovering and characterizing the subcomponents of the Galaxy and its building blocks. Now, the exquisite 6D phase-space plus chemical information from Gaia and its complementary spectroscopic surveys has handed us a plethora of data to pour over as we move towards a quantitative rather than qualitative view of the Galaxy and its progenitors. We review the state of the field in the post-Gaia era, and examine the key lessons that will dictate the future direction of Galactic halo research.</description>

      <title>Modelling the star-formation activity and ionizing properties of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early results from the JWST observations have reported a surprisingly high number of UV-bright galaxies at $z \geq 10$, which appears to challenge the theoretical predictions from standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM framework at these redshifts. To alleviate this tension, several cosmological and astrophysical interpretations have been advanced. However, all of these proposed scenarios carry noteworthy consequences for other large-scale processes in the early Universe, particularly cosmic reionization, since high-redshift galaxies are believed to be the primary ionizing sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To investigate this, we introduce a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution that explains the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (UVLF) over $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$, and also jointly tracks the time evolution of the globally averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium. The model self-consistently accounts for the suppression of star formation in low-mass galaxies due to reionization feedback and is constrained by comparing the model predictions with various observational probes like the UVLF data from HST and JWST, recent measurements of the neutral hydrogen fraction, and the CMB scattering optical depth. Our analysis confirms that a rapid enhancement in the star-formation rate efficiency and/or UV luminosity per stellar mass formed is necessary for consistency with the JWST UVLF estimates at $z \geq 10$. We further find that it is possible to jointly satisfy the current reionization constraints when the escape fraction is assumed to be halo-mass dependent, requiring higher Lyman-continuum leakage from low-mass galaxies. We also examine the relative contribution of galaxies with different UV luminosities towards the ionizing photon budget for the EoR and investigate the large-scale bias of high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>The "C": The large Chameleon-Musca-Coalsack cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D dust mapping have transformed our understanding of the Milky Way's local interstellar medium, enabling us to explore its structure in three spatial dimensions for the first time. In this Letter, we use the most recent 3D dust map by Edenhofer et al. to study the well-known Chameleon, Musca, and Coalsack cloud complexes, located about 200 pc from the Sun. We find that these three complexes are not isolated but rather connect to form a surprisingly well-defined half-ring, constituting a single C-shaped cloud with a radius of about 50 pc, a thickness of about 45 pc, and a total mass of about $5 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, or $9 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ if including everything in the vicinity of the C-shaped cloud. Despite the absence of an evident feedback source at its center, the dynamics of young stellar clusters associated with the C structure suggest that a single supernova explosion about 4 Myr to 10 Myr ago likely shaped this structure. Our findings support a single origin story for these cloud complexes, suggesting that they were formed by feedback-driven gas compression, and offer new insights into the processes that govern the birth of star-forming clouds in feedback-dominated regions, such as the Scorpius-Centaurus association.</description>

      <title>Dark matter in the Milky Way: Measurements up to 3 kpc from the Galactic plane above the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the gravitational force perpendicular to the Galactic plane at the position of the Sun based on a sample of red giants, with measurements taken from the DR3 Gaia catalogue. Measurements far out of the Galactic plane up to 3.5 kpc allow us to determine directly the total mass density, where dark matter is dominant and the stellar and gas densities are very low. In a complementary way, we have also used a new determination of the local baryonic mass density to help determine the density of dark matter in the Galactic plane at the solar position. For the local mass density of dark matter, we obtained $\rho_\mathrm{dm}$=0.0128$\pm $0.0008= 0.486 $\pm$0.030 Gev cm$^{-3}$. For the flattening of the gravitational potential of the dark halo, it is $q_\mathrm{\phi,h}$=0.843$\pm0.035$. For its density, $q_\mathrm{\rho,h}$=0.781$\pm$0.055.</description>

      <title>Effects of feedback-free starburst galaxies on the 21-cm signal and reionization history</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different star-formation models at Cosmic Dawn produce detectable signatures in the observables of upcoming 21-cm experiments. In this work, we consider the physical scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), according to which the star-formation efficiency (SFE) is enhanced in sufficiently massive halos at early enough times, thus explaining the indication from the James Webb Space Telescope for an excess of bright galaxies at $z \geq 10$. We model the contribution of FFBs to popII SFE and compute the impact these have on the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum. We show that FFBs affect the evolution of the brightness temperature and the 21-cm power spectrum, but they only have a limited effect on the neutral hydrogen fraction. We investigate how the observables are affected by changes in the underlying star formation model and by contribution from popIII stars. Finally, we forecast the capability of next-generation Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) to detect the existence of FFB galaxies via power spectrum measurements. Our results show the possibility of a significant detection, provided that popII stars are the main drivers of lowering the spin temperature. Efficient popIII star formation will make the detection more challenging.</description>

      <title>Impact of Star Pressure on $\gamma$ in Modified Gravity beyond Post-Newtonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the PPN approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit non\text{-}perturbative$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set $\textit joint$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 $\textit irrespective$ of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

Abstract: The problem of missing Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) refers to the issue that the currently known Galactic SNRs are significantly incomplete compared to the theoretical prediction. To expand the sample of Galactic SNRs, we use GLEAM and THOR+VGPS data across four wavebands ranging from 118 to 1420 MHz to drive a spectral index map covering the region within 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg}, where numerous SNR candidates were recently found. By using the spectral index map of the sky region and detailed analysis of the spectral indices of individual sources, we confirmed four SNR candidates, namely G26.75+0.73, G27.06+0.04, G28.36+0.21, and G28.78$-$0.44, as SNRs. Additionally, we discovered an expanding molecular superbubble located in this region, discussed pulsars associated with SNR candidates, and discovered a long H$\alpha$ filament that spatially overlaps with the candidate G29.38+0.10. We suggest that the problem of missing Galactic SNRs not only arises from observation limitations, but also could be due to the low-density environments of some SNRs, and the different SN explosion properties.</description>

Abstract: Feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) primarily affects the formation and evolution of galaxies and the circumgalactic medium, leaving some kind of imprint on larger scales. Based on the {\sc Simba} hydrodynamical simulation suite and using the full set of Minkowski functionals (MFs), this study systematically analyses the time evolution of the global geometry and topology of the gas temperature, pressure, density (total, HI, and H$_2$), and the metallicity fields between redshifts $z=5$ and $z=0$. The MFs show that small-scale astrophysical processes are persistent and manifest on larger, up to tens of Mpc scales, highlighting the specific morphological signatures of the relevant feedback mechanisms on these scales in the last $\sim12$~Gyr. In qualitative terms, we were able establish a ranking that varies according to the field considered: stellar feedback mostly determines the morphology of the pressure and density fields and AGN jets are the primary origin of the morphology of the temperature and metallicity fields, while X-ray heating and AGN winds play the second most important role in shaping the geometry and topology of all the gaseous fields, except metallicity. Hence, the cosmic evolution of the geometry and topology of fields characterising the thermodynamical and chemical properties of the cosmic web offers complementary, larger scale constraints to galaxy formation models.</description>
