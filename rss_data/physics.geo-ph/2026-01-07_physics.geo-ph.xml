      <title>Receiver Functions in the San Fernando Valley, California: Graph-Regularized Bayesian Approach for Gravity-Informed Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The San Fernando Valley (SFV) in Southern California is a complex sedimentary basin whose shape strongly influences ground shaking. We develop a fully quantitative, probabilistic graph-regularized inference model that integrates both gravity and receiver function (RF) constraints and evaluate its ability to determine the basin's shape. The sediment-basement interface in single-station RFs is often difficult to interpret due to scattering and noise, which can render isolated stations unusable. By using RFs from a dense seismic array and incorporating gravity, we address the issue of non-uniqueness in converting the times of RF phases to layer thickness by comparing the predicted gravity to observations at each station. In areas where the density contrast may change, Bayesian inference with a graph Laplacian allows us to determine the effective density contrast by taking into account its neighbors' picks and densities. This method promotes spatial smoothness between neighboring stations, while preserving sharp contrasts in locations supported by the RF and gravity data. We applied this method to a dataset that was acquired in fall 2023, when 140 nodes were installed in the SFV. Our results show the deep Sylmar sub-basin, the San Fernando sub-basin, and the Leadwell high found in a previous study (Ju\'arez-Z\'u\~niga and Persaud, 2025), and our results also show good agreement with the industry seismic reflection profiles across the valley. This method demonstrates how to incorporate gravity with lateral density variations into receiver function interpretation to better map interfaces in the subsurface.</description>

      <title>Enhanced 3D Gravity Inversion Using ResU-Net with Density Logging Constraints: A Dual-Phase Training Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity exploration has become an important geophysical method due to its low cost and high efficiency. With the rise of artificial intelligence, data-driven gravity inversion methods based on deep learning (DL) possess physical property recovery capabilities that conventional regularization methods lack. However, existing DL methods suffer from insufficient prior information constraints, which leads to inversion models with large data fitting errors and unreliable results. Moreover, the inversion results lack constraints and matching from other exploration methods, leading to results that may contradict known geological conditions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates prior density well logging information to address the above issues. First, we introduce a depth weighting function to the neural network (NN) and train it in the weighted density parameter domain. The NN, under the constraint of the weighted forward operator, demonstrates improved inversion performance, with the resulting inversion model exhibiting smaller data fitting errors. Next, we divide the entire network training into two phases: first training a large pre-trained network Net-I, and then using the density logging information as the constraint to get the optimized fine-tuning network Net-II. Through testing and comparison in synthetic models and Bishop Model, the inversion quality of our method has significantly improved compared to the unconstrained data-driven DL inversion method. Additionally, we also conduct a comparison and discussion between our method and both the conventional focusing inversion (FI) method and its well logging constrained variant. Finally, we apply this method to the measured data from the San Nicolas mining area in Mexico, comparing and analyzing it with two recent gravity inversion methods based on DL.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Simulation of the Propagation of P-SV Seismic Waves from Earthquakes: Application to Deep Earthquakes in Acre, Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brazil is located in the central-eastern portion of the South American Plate, meaning that the country mostly experiences low-intensity seismic activity within its territory. However, some geological faults in this region have generated intense earthquakes. In this context, we intend to describe a recent earthquake of magnitude around 6.5 M_b that occurred at a depth of approximately 600 km in the state of Acre, Brazil. In this work, we modeled the propagation of P-SV seismic waves using a two-dimensional system of partial differential equations (PDEs) in a two-dimensional vertical rectangular domain. The source is modeled by a Gaussian pulse function. The initial quiescence condition and Neumann boundary conditions are used. The PDE system is discretized by the finite difference method (FDM) and solved by the Gauss-Seidel method (GSM). The numerical simulations obtained describe the propagation of attenuated seismic waves in multiple geological layers, simulating intense and deep earthquakes in Acre. We used the propagation of perfect seismic waves to validate the model. The results include images of the simulations and theoretical seismograms simulating the vertical and horizontal displacement in the epicenter region and 200 km east and west of the epicenter.</description>

      <title>Warming-driven rise in soil moisture entropy signals destabilization of the Asian Water Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the "Asian Water Tower," is currently undergoing a rapid wetting trend. While this moisture increase is often viewed as beneficial for water availability, it remains unclear whether the hydrological system itself is becoming more resilient or drifting toward instability. Here, we apply an entropy-based framework to quantify the changing structural organization of the TP's soil moisture system. We show that from 2000 to 2024, regional wetting has driven a long-term decline in entropy, reflecting an increase in system order and stability due to enhanced hydrological buffering capacity. This stability is modulated by the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which regulates regional heterogeneity via a distinct spatial dipole. Crucially, however, CMIP6 climate projections reveal an alarming reversal: future warming triggers a rise in entropy. This transition signals a loss of systemic resilience, characterized by intensified spatial disorder and potential abrupt regime shifts by the mid-century. Our findings suggest that while current wetting provides a stabilizing buffer, continued warming is projected to amplify spatial heterogeneity, thereby destabilizing the Asian Water Tower, with significant risks for downstream water security.</description>
