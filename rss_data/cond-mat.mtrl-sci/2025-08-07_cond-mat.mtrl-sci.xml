      <title>A comparative study of the high-pressure structural stability of zirconolite materials for nuclear waste immobilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of the high-pressure behaviours of the nuclear waste immobilisation materials zirconolite-2M, -4M, -3O, and -3T. The materials are studied under high-pressure conditions using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. For zirconolite-2M we also performed density-functional theory calculations. A new triclinic crystal structure (space group P-1), instead of the previously assigned monoclinic structure (space group C2/c) is proposed for zirconolite-2M. We named the triclinic structure as zirconolite-2TR. We also found that zirconolite-2TR undergoes a phase transition at 14.7 GPa to a monoclinic structure described by space group C2/c, which is different than the high-pressure structure previously proposed in the literature. These results are discussed in comparison with previous studies on zirconolite-2M and the related compound calzirtite. For the other three zirconolite structures (4M, 3O, and 3T) this is the first high-pressure study, and we find no evidence for pressure induced phase transitions in any of them. The linear compressibility of the studied compounds, as well as a room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state, are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Orientational Disorder of NH$_3$ in Hexammine Magnesium Borohydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexammine magnesium borohydride, Mg(NH$_3$)$_6$(BH$_4$)$_2$, consists of adducted NH$_3$ molecules locked in a matrix of Mg cations and borohydride anions. It is a candidate material for hydrogen storage, with 16.8wt\% hydrogen stored in both the NH$_3$ and borohydride anions. It also may be of interest as a Mg$^{2+}$ conducting electrolyte in solid state batteries. Its crystal structure has, until now, eluded a proper structural solution due to ambiguity regarding the NH$_3$ position and behaviour. In this work, we show using synchrotron X-ray diffraction that the room-temperature structure can be solved only with a model assuming orientational disorder of ammonia molecules within the crystal structure. Cooling the sample to 120\,K yields additional Bragg peaks, which can only be solved with a unit cell expansion consistent with a freezing of the orientational freedom of ammonia molecules. Using this insight from the structure solution, we perform a full assignment of the vibrational modes in the room-temperature IR spectrum.</description>

      <title>The role of orbital polarization and spin-dependent electron-phonon scatterings in chiral-induced spin selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral materials exhibit unique spin and charge transport properties, notably through the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, enabling spin-polarized currents in nonmagnetic materials without external magnetic fields at room temperature. In this study, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying CISS in a prototypical chiral solid, trigonal selenium (Se), based on a first principles spatial-temporal resolved density-matrix dynamics approach, including electron-phonon scattering with self-consistent spin-orbit couplings (SOC). Our approach elucidates the interplay of SOC, structural chirality, and spin-dependent electron-phonon interactions in driving the generation and transport of spin and orbital angular momentum. We demonstrate that charge transport along the chiral axis induces significant chirality-dependent spin and orbital polarization, which shows a monotonic increase with higher chirality. Meanwhile, we show the orbital polarization generated in CISS has a weak dependence on SOC, unlike spin. Most importantly, we reveal the key difference between the CISS and colinear Edelstein effect (CEE) originating from spin-dependent electron-phonon scatterings, which explains the spin polarization increase with device lengths, a unique feature in CISS.</description>

      <title>EAC-Net: Real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density is a fundamental quantity in quantum simulations, yet its accurate computation remains a major bottleneck. We present the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), a deep learning framework for efficient and accurate charge density prediction. By introducing an atom-grid coupling mechanism, EAC-Net integrates the strengths of grid-based and basis-function-based models, achieving simultaneous improvements in accuracy and efficiency. We evaluated EAC-Net on a wide variety of systems, including amorphous solids, molecular liquids, surface structures, and metallic alloys, and found that it consistently achieves high accuracy with prediction errors typically below 1%. We further develop EAC-mp by training on Material Project's CHGCAR datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to existing large charge density models while providing atomic-decomposed charge densities. The model demonstrates strong zero-shot prediction capabilities across diverse material systems. Moreover, EAC-Net generalizes well beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as non-self-consistent band structure calculations under structural perturbations. By bridging local chemical environments and global charge distributions, EAC-Net provides a scalable and general framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction, with potential applications in high-throughput materials screening and machine-learning-driven simulation workflows.</description>

      <title>Competing Magnetic Phases in Li-Fe-Ge Kagome Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competing interlayer magnetic interactions in kagome magnets can lead to diverse magnetic phases, which enable various promising topological or quantum material properties. Here, the electronic structure and magnetic properties have been studied using first-principles calculations for the LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$, and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$ compounds sharing the kagome Fe$_3$Ge layer motif but with different interlayer arrangements. For LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$ and LiFe$_6$Ge$_5$, the predicted magnetic ground states are collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) states involving a mix of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM interlayer orientations. Whereas for LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$, an incommensurate cycloidal spin spiral is stabilized as a ground state, being close to a collinear A-type AFM state. The analysis of magnetic RKKY exchange coupling confirms the results of electronic structure calculations. The values of atomic magnetic moments are in good agreement with existing experimental estimations. Our experiments on LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$ single crystals have observed AFM ordering at ~540 K and spin-reorientation transition with a small FM component (possibly with spin canting) below ~270 K. Thus, both theory and experiment independently suggest the existence and sequence of non-collinear and collinear magnetic states in kagome LiFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our findings provide a platform for exploring various novel magnetic phases and associated unconventional or topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Discovery of Ternary Chiral Materials via Large-Scale Random Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral inorganic crystals with topological characteristics, prized for their exotic properties and fundamental interest, remain scarce in existing database. This work establishes a viable route for their large-scale discovery by integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) for high-throughput structure optimization with the broad exploration capability of Random Structure Search (RSS). We implemented this combined uMLIP-RSS workflow to perform massive variable-composition crystal structure prediction across ternary systems, specifically targeting chiral space groups. High-throughput uMLIP-based optimization and stability screening of over 20 million randomly generated chiral structures identified numerous potentially stable phases out of existing database. Subsequent validation by first-principles confirmed over 120 new chiral inorganic crystals with promising functional applications, including topological characteristics, nonlinear optics, and superconductivity. Notably, this set includes materials exhibiting remarkable quantum phenomena, such as the nonlinear Hall effect driven by berry curvature dipole, quantum metric and symmetry-enforced six-fold topological points, long Fermi arcs and large magnetoresistance. This work substantially expands the pool of chiral functional materials and demonstrates a scalable, efficient strategy for predictive discovery in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Open Gas-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy at 50 pm Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has reached ~ 50 picometer resolution in a high vacuum, enabling single-atom sensitive imaging of nanomaterials. Extending this capability to gaseous environments would allow for similar visualizations of nanomaterial dynamics under chemically reactive conditions. Here, we examine a new TEM system that maintains 50 pm resolution at pressures up to 1 mbar, demonstrated using nanocrystalline Au immersed in N2. The system features an open gas-cell with a four-stage differential pumping system, a 5th order aberration corrector for broad-beam TEM, a monochromatized electron beam, an ultra-stable microscope platform, Nelsonian low electron dose-rate illumination, and direct electron detection. Young fringe experiments and exit wave phase imaging confirm the atomic resolution and indicate location-dependent vibrational blur at surface terminations. Thus, this platform advances in situ and operando TEM studies of gas-surface interactions in diverse fields, including catalysis, corrosion, and crystal growth.</description>

      <title>Theory of circular dichroism in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in magnetic materials. We define RIXS-CD as the difference between scattering amplitudes for the right- and left-circularly polarized incoming photons and unpolarized (total) outgoing photons. We employ the impurity approximation, in which the interference between scattering events on different atoms is neglected. We perform the symmetry analysis of several common antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic structures and outline the general approach. The analysis is supported by numerical calculations using atomic model with realistic crystal fields obtained from first principles. We show that RIXS-CD is distinguished from first-order spectroscopies such as x-ray magnetic circular dichroism by insensitivity to the time-reversal symmetry breaking. As a result we find that RIXS-CD is present in the normal (disordered) state of materials with lower symmetry. In antiferromagnets the RIXS-CD is invariant under N\'eel vector reversal. In altermagnets and ferromagnets the RIXS-CD spectra for time-reversed states are, in general, independent except for the special case when there is a unitary symmetry of the Hamiltonian connecting the</description>

      <title>Nature of field-induced transitions and hysteretic magnetoresistance in non-collinear antiferromagnet EuIn2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the magnetic and electrical transport properties of the hexagonal EuIn2As2 compound, combining experimental and theoretical results. This compound is predicted to be an axion-insulator from an electronic point of view and an altermagnet while in the collinear magnetic phase. However, experiments indicate that the Fermi level lies within the valence band rather than in the topological gap, potentially leading to the dominance of magnetic properties. Our detailed studies on magnetization and electrical transport support the presence of a broken-helix antiferromagnetic state, which was previously identified by X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Notably, we observed within that state a field-induced metamagnetic transition marked by a large hysteresis in magnetoresistance, which turns into a sharp upturn for the magnetic field tilted by 15 degree from the c-axis of the crystal. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is explained that the application of a magnetic field changes the low-resistivity antiferromagnetic domain walls to the high-resistivity domain walls due to the reduction in the Fermi surface sheets interaction area in the domain walls, originating from p-orbitals of As. EuIn2As2, therefore, presents a new case study that broadens the understanding of complex magnetic structures and their influence on electrical transport.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-Irida-Graphene: A New 2D Carbon Allotrope for Sodium-Ion Battery Anodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for sustainable and efficient energy storage has driven the exploration of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as promising alternatives to lithium-ion systems. However, the larger ionic radius of sodium poses intrinsic challenges such as slow diffusion and structural strain in conventional electrode materials. As a contribution to addressing these limitations, the \b{eta}-Irida-graphene ($\beta$-IG) is herein introduced, a novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope derived from Irida-graphene, featuring a diverse polygonal lattice of 3-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 9-membered carbon rings. Through density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, $\beta$-IG demonstrated remarkable thermal, dynamical, and mechanical stability, coupled with intrinsic conductive character and efficient sodium-ion mobility (energy barriers &lt; 0.30 eV). Furthermore, the adsorption of sodium ions was energetically favorable, delivering an impressive predicted specific capacity of 554.5 mAh/g. The reported findings highlight $\beta$-IG as a good potential anode candidate for next-generation SIBs, offering high-rate performance and structural robustness, and expanding the functional design space for advanced carbon-based electrode materials.</description>

      <title>Using Topology to Predict Electrides in the Solid State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrides are characterized by electron density highly localized in interstitial sites, which do not coincide with the interatomic contacts. The rigorous quantum mechanical definition of electrides is based upon topological criteria derived from the electron density, and in particular the presence of non-nuclear attractors (NNAs). We employ these topological criteria in combination with crystal structure prediction methods (the XtalOpt evolutionary algorithm), to accelerate the discovery of crystalline electrides at ambient and non-ambient pressures. The localization and quantification of NNAs is used as the primary discriminator for the electride character of a solid within a multi-objective evolutionary structure search. We demonstrate the reliability of this approach through a comprehensive crystal structure prediction study of Ca5Pb3 at 20 GPa, a system previously theorized to exhibit electride character under compression. Our strategy could predict, and sort on-the-fly, several unknown low-enthalpy phases that possess NNAs in interstitial loci, such as the newly discovered P4/mmm structure. These results demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms, guided by rigorous topological descriptors, can be relied upon to effectively survey complex phases to find new electride candidates.</description>

      <title>Growth of few-layer molecular crystals of PTCDI on hexagonal boron nitride by microspacing air-gap sublimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended two-dimensional (2D) crystals of dye molecules adsorbed on 2D material substrates like boron nitride have recently become a subject of intense study, with potential applications ranging from quantum technology to optoelectronics. The most established technique for the production of these films is physical vapor transport in vacuum. We demonstrate that few-layer crystalline films of the organic dye molecule PTCDI on boron nitride can be produced by microspacing in-air sublimation, a radically simplified technique, not requiring complicated vacuum systems. The resulting layers display clearly resolved atomic step terraces in atomic force microscopy, and a clear polarization anisotropy in their fluorescence, confirming molecular alignment and long-range order. Using density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics simulations, the canted motive is identified as the most likely building block for the morphology of a PTDCI monolayer on the hBN substrate.</description>

      <title>Tailored Thermal and Mechanical Performance of Biodegradable PLA-P(VDF-TrFE) Polymer Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of polymer blends has emerged as a strategic approach for designing multifunctional materials with enhanced tailored characteristics. Current work investigates and reports for the first time, the structure-property relationships in free-standing blend films of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) and polylactic acid (PLA), prepared to evaluate their suitability for functional applications. For this investigation, films of approximately 40 $\mu$m thick were fabricated by systematically varying the P(VDF-TrFE):PLA ratio. Thermal analysis revealed a higher PLA crystallinity at 25\% P(VDF-TrFE) content, while Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed the electroactive $\beta$-phase fraction to be highest in the 50:50 composition. These findings correlated with tensile strength measurements and morphology, demonstrating that molecular ordering and phase distribution significantly influence the mechanical performance. The 25:75 blend exhibited superior mechanical strength due to enhanced PLA crystallization and polymer chain alignment. In contrast, the 50:50 blend achieved a balance between tensile modulus and electroactive phase development, marking it a promising candidate for sensors and 3D printing applications. At higher P(VDF-TrFE) content, reduced crystallinity in PLA resulted in softer, more compliant films which would be suitable for flexible electronic applications. These results establish a pathway to tune mechanical and functional properties in semicrystalline polymer blends through facile compositional control.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in a $d$-dimensional rough potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of diffusion in solids is necessary to understand the microstructure evolution in materials out of equilibrium. Although one can reasonably predict diffusive transport coefficients using atomistic methods, these approaches can be very computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an analytical model for the diffusivity in a noisy solid solution in an arbitrary number of dimensions using a mean first passage time analysis. These analytical results are then compared with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, which are in good agreement with the simulation data in the low-noise limit. We argue that the difference is expected from percolation pathways that increase the diffusivity in the KMC analysis but are not captured by the model. This generalization to arbitrary dimensions has been elusive to the community since Zwanzig [PNAS, 85, 2029 (1988)] published his seminal work on 1-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A colossal dielectric response of HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a colossal dielectric response of small (5 - 10 nm) oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles (x = 1 - 0.4), prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The effective dielectric permittivity of the pressed HfxZr1-xO2 nanopowders has a pronounced maximum at 38 - 88 C, which shape can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss type dependence modified for the diffuse ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The maximal value of the dielectric permittivity increases from 1.5*10^3 (for x = 1) to 1.5*10^5 (for x= 0.4) at low frequencies (~4 Hz); being much smaller, namely changing from 7 (for x = 1) to 20 (for x = 0.4) at high frequencies (~500 kHz). The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity maximum position is almost absent, meanwhile the shape and width of the maximum changes in a complex way with increase in frequency. The temperature dependencies of the dielectric permittivity and resistivity are almost mirror-like turned over in respect to each other, which means that all their features, such as position and shape of maxima, plateau, minima and inflexions, almost coincide after the mirror reflection in respect to the temperature axis. These correlations of resistivity and dielectric permittivity are well-described in the Heywang barrier model applied together with the variable range hopping conduction model in semiconducting ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric-like behavior of the dielectric permittivity is explained by the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory calculations, which reveal that small HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles can become ferroelectric in the presence of oxygen vacancies. Obtained results may be useful for developing silicon-compatible ferroelectric nanomaterials based on HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Topological domain-wall states from Umklapp scattering in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twistronics, harnessing interlayer rotation to tailor electronic states in van der Waals materials, has predominantly focused on small-angle regime. Here, we unveil the pivotal role of intervalley Umklapp scattering in large-angle twisted bilayer graphene, which governs low-energy physics and drives unconventional band topology. By constructing symmetry-constrained effective $k\cdot p$ models for $\pm 21.8^{\circ}$-twisted bilayers, we demonstrate how structural chirality imprints distinct electronic responses. The $D_6$ configuration exhibits a gapped spectrum with chiral interlayer coupling, while $D_3$ symmetric stacking configuration displays semimetallic behavior. Crucially, chirality inversion creates topological domain-wall states, which manifest as counterpropagating pseudospin modes at interfaces between oppositely twisted regions. These states, absent in untwisted bilayers, emerge from a Jackiw-Rebbi-like mechanism tied to chirality reversal. Atomistic simulations confirm these topological states and demonstrate their robustness against symmetry-breaking perturbations. The interplay between twist-induced chirality and topology opens new pathways for engineering domain-wall states in twisted materials.</description>

      <title>4D-PreNet: A Unified Preprocessing Framework for 4D-STEM Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.</description>

      <title>Microwave characterization of superconducting coplanar resonators made out of granular aluminium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have designed, fabricated and characterized microwave resonators made out of thin films of granular aluminium (grAl) with different oxygen content. We extract the contribution of the large kinetic-inductance of this disordered superconductor from the frequency shift of the resonators as a function of temperature, and discuss the correlation with the resistivity of the films. At low temperatures, measurements of the internal quality factor as a function of microwave power indicate the presence of two-level systems, which are inherent to the growth process of the granular aluminium. The characterization methods presented here may be useful for the design of MKIDs, high-impedance resonators and superinductors.</description>

      <title>H$_2$O and CO$_2$ sorption in ion exchange sorbents: distinct interactions in amine versus quaternary ammonium materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the H$_2$O  and CO$_2$ sorption behavior of two ion exchange sorbents: a primary amine and a permanently charged strong base quaternary ammonium (QA) groups with (bi)carbonate counter-anions. We compare their distinct interactions with H$_2$O  and CO$_2$ through simultaneous thermal gravimetric, calorimetric, gas analysis and molecular modeling to evaluate their performance for dilute CO$_2$ separations like direct air capture. Thermal and hybrid (heat + low-temperature hydration) desorption experiments demonstrate that the QA-based sorbent binds both water and CO$_2$ more strongly than the amine counterparts but undergoes degradation at moderate temperatures, limiting its compatibility with thermal swing regeneration. However, a low-temperature moisture-driven regeneration pathway at is uniquely effective for the QA-based sorbent. To inform the energetics of a moisture-based CO$_2$ separation, we compare calorimetric water sorption enthalpies to isosteric enthalpies. To our knowledge, this includes the first direct measurement of water sorption enthalpy in the QA-based sorbent. Molecular modeling supports this observation, showing higher water sorption energies and denser charge distributions in the QA-based sorbent. Mixed gas experiments in QA-based sorbent show that not only does water influence CO$_2$ binding, but CO$_2$ influences water uptake through counterion-dependent hydration states, and that moisture swing responsiveness in this material causes hydration-induced CO$_2$ release and drying-induced CO$_2$ uptake, an important feature for low-energy CO$_2$ separation under ambient conditions. Overall, the two classes of sorbents offer distinct pathways for CO$_2$ separation. Primary amine-based sorbent relies on weaker hydrogen bonding and CO$_2$-amine interactions, while QA-based sorbent leverages stronger electrostatic coupling between water and QA-reactive anion pairs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum--Classical Machine Learning Potential with Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative, suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ and find that it hosts anisotropic multiple valleys originating from the splitting of the van Hove singularity in graphene. To make use of its favorable electronic structure, we investigate the electronic structure of alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$, where intercalated atoms not only introduce electron carriers but also suppress interlayer coupling. We find that the interlayer transfer is effectively suppressed by potassium intercalation, by which the favorable electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ is preserved. Finally, we perform model calculation with the onsite-energy offset, and we verify that the strategy of introducing the splitting to the van Hove singularity works well.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formulation of the spin magnetic octupole moment in bulk crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of unconventional antiferromagnets, such as altermagnets, has drawn significant attention to higher-rank magnetic multipoles, particularly magnetic octupoles. Despite the advances in research, attempts to understand their microscopic properties remain limited due to the unbounded nature of the position operator in bulk crystals. In this paper, we address this problem by using a well-known thermodynamic approach and derive a formula for the spin magnetic octupole moment (SMOM) that can be used in bulk crystals. The resulting formula is gauge invariant and satisfies St\v{r}eda formulas that relate the SMOM to the spin magnetoelectric dipole-quadrupole susceptibilities. Furthermore, we apply this formula to several models and examine the fundamental properties of the SMOM. For example, in $d$-wave altermagnets, the nonrelativistic component of the SMOM, which is independent of spin-orbit coupling, is larger than the relativistic component, which is induced by spin-orbit coupling. These nonrelativistic SMOMs have the same microscopic origin as the nonrelativistic spin splitting that characterizes $d$-wave altermagnetism. Moreover, they exhibit a N\'{e}el vector dependence consistent with Landau theory for $d$-wave altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 176702 (2024)].</description>

Abstract: Thorium-229 has the lowest nuclear-excited state (an isomer state) at approximately 8.356 eV, making it excitable with tabletop vacuum-ultraviolet lasers. Despite the recent success of laser excitation, the isomer quenching inside the solid-state environment remains unresolved. In this letter, we present experiments investigating X-ray-induced isomer quenching in the CaF$_2$ host, focusing on the effects of X-ray flux and temperature on the lifetime and yield of the isomer state. Our studies reveal a correlation between isomer production, isomer lifetime during irradiation, and post-irradiation afterglow of the target crystal across different temperatures, highlighting a strong relationship between isomer quenching and color-center dynamics. We developed a model to interpret the isomer quenching and the crystal's luminescence.</description>

      <title>Atypical Ferrimagnetism in Ni$_4$Nb$_2$O$_9$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetism typically emerges from chemically distinct magnetic ions or the same element at two inequivalent crystallographic sites, rendering unequal moments. In contrast, Ni4Nb2O9 has been recently discovered to show a different mechanism, where identical Ni2 ions with the same ligand coordination develop unequal magnetic moments purely due to differences in local environments. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of this emergent mechanism through a synergy of powder neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, and first principle based calculations. We demonstrate that the NiA and NiB sublattices, while sharing the same nominal valence, differ in their magnetic dimensionality NiA forms quasi one dimensional chains with enhanced p d hybridization and a reduced magnetic moment, whereas NiB retains a nearly two-dimensional geometry and a full S 1 moment. Our results underscore the pivotal role of spin dimensionality and local structural distortions in stabilizing ferrimagnetism in systems with electronically equivalent magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>Curvature induced modifications of chirality and magnetic configuration in perpendicular magnetized films</title>

Abstract: Designing curvature in three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures enables controlled manipulation of local energy landscapes, allowing for the modification of noncollinear spin textures relevant for next-generation spintronic devices. In this study, we experimentally investigate 3D magnetization textures in a Co/Pd multilayer film, exhibiting strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), deposited onto curved Cu nanowire meshes with diameters as small as 50nm and lengths of several microns. Utilizing magnetic soft X-ray nanotomography, we achieve reconstructions of 3D magnetic domain patterns at approximately 30nm spatial resolution. This approach provides detailed information on both the orientation and magnitude of magnetization within the film. Our results reveal that interfacial anisotropy in the Co/Pd multilayers drives the magnetization towards the local surface normal. In contrast to typical labyrinth domains observed in planar films, the presence of curved nanowires significantly alters the domain structure, with domains preferentially aligning along the nanowire axis in close proximity, while adopting random orientations farther away. We report direct experimental observation of a curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which is quantified to be approximately one-third of the intrinsic DMI in Co/Pd stacks. The curvature induced DMI enhances stability of Neel-type domain walls. These experimental observations are further supported by micromagnetic simulations. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that introducing curvature into magnetic nanostructures provides a powerful strategy for tailoring complex magnetic behaviors, paving the way for the design of advanced 3D racetrack memory and neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.</description>

      <title>Adjudicating Conduction Mechanisms in High Performance Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.</description>

      <title>Undulation-induced moir\'e superlattices with 1D polarization domains and 1D flat bands in 2D bilayer semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have a high F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an number and can be easily bent, much like a paper, making undulations a novel way to design distinct electronic phases. Through first-principles calculations, we reveal the formation of 1D polarization domains and 1D flat electronic bands by 1D bending modulation to a 2D bilayer semiconductor. Using 1D sinusoidal undulation of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer as an example, we demonstrate how undulation induces nonuniform shear patterns, creating regions with unique local stacking and vertical polarization akin to sliding-induced ferroelectrics observed in twisted moir\'e systems. This sliding-induced polarization is also observed in double-wall BN nanotubes due to curvature differences between inner and outer tubes. Furthermore, undulation generates a shear-induced 1D moir\'e pattern that perturbs electronic states, confining them into 1D quantum-well-like bands with kinetic energy quenched in modulation direction while dispersive in other directions (1D flat bands). This electronic confinement is attributed to modulated shear deformation potential resulting from tangential polarization due to the moir\'e pattern. Thus, bending modulation and interlayer shear offer an alternative avenue, termed "curvytronics", to induce exotic phenomena in 2D bilayer materials.</description>

      <title>Upsampling DINOv2 features for unsupervised vision tasks and weakly supervised materials segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The features of self-supervised vision transformers (ViTs) contain strong semantic and positional information relevant to downstream tasks like object localization and segmentation. Recent works combine these features with traditional methods like clustering, graph partitioning or region correlations to achieve impressive baselines without finetuning or training additional networks. We leverage upsampled features from ViT networks (e.g DINOv2) in two workflows: in a clustering based approach for object localization and segmentation, and paired with standard classifiers in weakly supervised materials segmentation. Both show strong performance on benchmarks, especially in weakly supervised segmentation where the ViT features capture complex relationships inaccessible to classical approaches. We expect the flexibility and generalizability of these features will both speed up and strengthen materials characterization, from segmentation to property-prediction.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>A general formalism for machine-learning models based on multipolar-spherical harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formulation of descriptors of the local chemical environment, enabling the construction of machine-learning models, is usually obtained by studying the properties of the expansion coefficients of a neighborhood density. In this work, we show that all the transformation properties of the descriptors and their behaviour under rotation, inversion and complex conjugation, are derived from the choice of the basis over which the density is expanded. Furthermore, crucially they are independent from the explicit mathematical form of the neighborhood density. In particular, we show that all the descriptors investigated, can be obtained by an expansion in multipolar spherical harmonics, which constitutes the core of this work, and which is introduced and analysed in great detail. By exploiting the orthogonality and the transformation rules of the multipolar spherical harmonics, we show that several formulations are simplified, such as the one needed to obtain the $\lambda-$SOAP kernel and its properties. We close this work by applying our framework to several multi-body descriptors available in literature, providing an in-depth analysis of their main properties, as made clear from the vantage viewpoint of a basis-centered approach.</description>

      <title>From weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the frustrated quantum spin-Peierls chain</title>

Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.</description>

      <title>Oxide Interface-Based Polymorphic Electronic Devices for Neuromorphic Computing</title>

Abstract: Aside from recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models, specialized AI hardware is crucial to address large volumes of unstructured and dynamic data. Hardware-based AI, built on conventional complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-technology, faces several critical challenges including scaling limitation of devices [1, 2], separation of computation and memory units [3] and most importantly, overall system energy efficiency [4]. While numerous materials with emergent functionalities have been proposed to overcome these limitations, scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility remain critical obstacles [5, 6]. Here, we demonstrate oxide-interface based polymorphic electronic devices with programmable transistor, memristor, and memcapacitor functionalities by manipulating the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures [7, 8] using lateral gates. A circuit utilizing two polymorphic functionalities of transistor and memcapacitor exhibits nonlinearity and short-term memory, enabling implementation in physical reservoir computing. An integrated circuit incorporating transistor and memristor functionalities is utilized for the transition from short- to long-term synaptic plasticity and for logic operations, along with in-situ logic output storage. The same circuit with advanced reconfigurable synaptic logic operations presents high-level multi-input decision-making tasks, such as patient-monitoring in healthcare applications. Our findings pave the way for oxide-based monolithic integrated circuits in a scalable, silicon compatible, energy efficient single platform, advancing both the polymorphic and neuromorphic computings.</description>
