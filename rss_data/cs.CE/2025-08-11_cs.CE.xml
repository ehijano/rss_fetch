      <title>Rethinking the Sioux Falls Network: Insights from Path-Driven Higher-Order Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmark scenarios are widely used in transportation research to evaluate routing algorithms, simulate infrastructure interventions, and test new technologies under controlled conditions. However, the structural and behavioral fidelity of these benchmarks remains largely unquantified, raising concerns about the external validity of simulation results. In this study, we introduce a mathematical framework based on higher-order network models to evaluate the representativeness of benchmark networks, focusing on the widely used Sioux Falls scenario. Higher-order network models encode empirical and simulated trajectory data into memory-aware network representations, which we use to quantify sequential dependencies in mobility behavior and assess how well benchmark networks capture real-world structural and functional patterns. Applying this framework to the Sioux Falls network, as well as real-world trajectory data, we quantify structural complexity, optimal memory length, link prediction accuracy, and centrality alignment. Our results show and statistically quantify that the classical Sioux Falls network exhibits limited path diversity, rapid structural fragmentation at higher orders, and weak alignment with empirical routing behavior. These results illustrate the potential of higher-order network models to bridge the gap between simulation-based and real-world mobility analysis, providing a robust foundation for more accurate and generalizable insights in transportation research.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Alpha: Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models for Alpha Mining in Quantitative Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha factor mining is a fundamental task in quantitative trading, aimed at discovering interpretable signals that can predict asset returns beyond systematic market risk. While traditional methods rely on manual formula design or heuristic search with machine learning, recent advances have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated factor discovery. However, existing LLM-based alpha mining approaches remain limited in terms of automation, generality, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Alpha, a novel, simple, yet effective and efficient LLM-based framework for fully automated formulaic alpha mining. Our method features a dual-chain architecture, consisting of a Factor Generation Chain and a Factor Optimization Chain, which iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine candidate alpha factors using only market data, while leveraging backtest feedback and prior optimization knowledge. The two chains work synergistically to enable high-quality alpha discovery without human intervention and offer strong scalability. Extensive experiments on real-world A-share benchmarks demonstrate that Chain-of-Alpha outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, presenting a promising direction for LLM-driven quantitative research.</description>

      <title>Bridging Farm Economics and Landscape Ecology for Global Sustainability through Hierarchical and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural landscapes face the dual challenge of sustaining food production while reversing biodiversity loss. Agri-environmental policies often fall short of delivering ecological functions such as landscape connectivity, in part due to a persistent disconnect between farm-level economic decisions and landscape-scale spatial planning. We introduce a novel hierarchical optimization framework that bridges this gap. First, an Ecological Intensification (EI) model determines the economically optimal allocation of land to margin and habitat interventions at the individual farm level. These farm-specific intervention levels are then passed to an Ecological Connectivity (EC) model, which spatially arranges them across the landscape to maximize connectivity while preserving farm-level profitability. Finally, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach that translates these spatial outcomes into simple, cost effective, and scalable policy instruments, such as subsidies and eco-premiums, using non-spatial, farm-level policy parameters. Applying the framework to a Canadian agricultural landscape, we demonstrate how it enhances connectivity under real-world economic constraints. Our approach provides a globally relevant tool for aligning farm incentives with biodiversity goals, advancing the development of agri-environmental policies that are economically viable and ecologically effective.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Collocation Point Strategies For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose two adaptive collocation point selection strategies utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approaches improve PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</description>

      <title>CAMEF: Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting by Integrating Time Series Patterns and Salient Macroeconomic Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</description>

      <title>From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>Advancing Welding Defect Detection in Maritime Operations via Adapt-WeldNet and Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fleet Upgrade Decisions with Machine-Learning Enhanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet management.</description>
