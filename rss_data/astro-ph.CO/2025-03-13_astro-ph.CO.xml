      <title>Detection of magnetic fields in superclusters of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in large scale structure filaments beyond galaxy clusters remain poorly understood. Superclusters offer a unique setting to study these low density environments, where weak signals make detection challenging. The Faraday rotation measure (RM) of polarized sources along supercluster lines of sight helps constrain magnetic field properties in these regions. This study aims to determine magnetic field intensity in low density environments within superclusters using RM measurements at different frequencies. We analyzed three nearby (z&lt;0.1) superclusters, Corona Borealis, Hercules, and Leo, where polarization observations were available at 1.4 GHz and 144 MHz. Our catalogue includes 4497 polarized background sources with RM values from literature and unpublished 144 MHz data. We constructed 3D density cubes for each supercluster to estimate density at RM measurement locations. By grouping RM values into three density bins (outskirts, filaments, and nodes) we examined RM variance linked to mean density. We found an RM variance excess of 2.5 \pm 0.5 rad^2 m^{-4} between the lowest-density regions outside the supercluster and the low-density filamentary regions within. This suggests an intervening magnetic field in the supercluster filaments. Modeling the RM variance with a single scale, randomly oriented magnetic field, we constrained the line of sight magnetic field to B_{//} = 19^{+50}_{-8} nG after marginalizing over reversal scale and path length. Our findings align with previous studies of large scale structure filaments, suggesting that adiabatic compression alone (B_{||} \sim 2 nG) cannot fully explain the observed field strengths. Other amplification mechanisms likely contribute to the evolution of magnetic fields in superclusters.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Self-Interacting Dark Matter from Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) environments around black holes (BHs) can influence their mergers through dynamical friction, causing gravitational wave (GW) dephasing during the inspiral phase. While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, we show that SIDM models with a massive force mediator can support dense enough DM spikes, significantly affecting BH mergers and producing a distinct GW dephasing. Using ${N}$-body simulations, we analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.</description>

      <title>Prospects for ${\rm kSZ^2}$-${\rm 21cm^2}$ Cross-Correlations during Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21\,cm line and the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect are promising and complementary probes of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A challenge for cross-correlating these two signals is that foreground avoidance or removal algorithms applied to the 21\,cm data inevitably sacrifice Fourier modes with long wavelengths along the line-of-sight (i.e., low-$k_\parallel$ modes), yet \textit{only} these same modes contribute to the kSZ signal. Here we show that a suitable kSZ$^2$ $\times$ 21\,cm$^2$ cross-correlation statistic nevertheless remains non-vanishing, even after filtering out the corrupted low-$k_\parallel$ Fourier modes from the 21\,cm data. We simulate the kSZ$^2$ $\times$ 21\,cm$^2$ cross-correlation signal across reionization-era redshifts and find distinctive redshift evolution. This signal peaks early in the reionization history, when the volume-averaged fraction is around $0.1 \lesssim x_\mathrm{HII} \lesssim 0.2$, after which it changes sign and reaches a minimum near reionization's midpoint ($x_\mathrm{HII} \sim 0.5$), while the signal gradually vanishes as reionization completes. These trends appear generic across three simulated models which differ in their reionization histories. We forecast the detectability of the kSZ$^2$ $\times$ 21\,cm$^2$ cross-power spectrum for the HERA and SKA1-Low 21\,cm experiments in combination with current and next-generation CMB surveys including the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD. We find that a high-significance detection ($\mathrm{S/N} \gtrsim 5\sigma$) is possible with SKA1-Low and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Hints of Primordial Magnetic Fields at Recombination and Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs), long studied as potential relics of the early Universe, accelerate the recombination process and have been proposed as a possible way to relieve the Hubble tension. However, previous studies relied on simplified toy models. In this study, for the first time, we use the recent high-precision evaluations of recombination with PMFs, incorporating full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and detailed Lyman-alpha radiative transfer, to test PMF-enhanced recombination ($b\Lambda$CDM) against observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SN). Focusing on non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum, we find a preference for present-day total field strengths of approximately 5-10 pico-Gauss. Depending on the dataset combination, this preference ranges from mild ($\sim 1.8\sigma$ with Planck + DESI) to moderate ($\sim 3\sigma$ with Planck + DESI + SH0ES-calibrated SN) significance. The $b\Lambda$CDM has Planck + DESI $\chi^2$ values equal or better than those of the $\Lambda$CDM model while predicting a higher Hubble constant. The favored field strengths align closely with those required for cluster magnetic fields to originate entirely from primordial sources, without the need for additional dynamo amplification or stellar magnetic field contamination. Future high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization measurements will be crucial for confirming or further constraining the presence of PMFs at recombination.</description>

      <title>Are dark matter and dark energy omnipresent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of temporal singularities (transients) in the mass-energy density and pressure, bearing a specific mathematical structure which represents a new solution to the continuity equation (\ie~conservation of mass-energy) and satisfying the strong energy condition, is proposed to account for the expansion history of a homogeneous Universe, and the formation and binding of large scale structures as a continuum approximation of their cumulative effects. These singularities are unobservable because they occur rarely in time and are unresolvably fast, and that could be the reason why dark matter and dark energy have not been found. Implication on inflationary cosmology is discussed. The origin of these temporal singularities is unknown, safe to say that the same is true of the moment of the Big Bang itself. This work complements a recent paper, where a topological defect in the form of a spatial, spherical shell of density singularity giving rise to a 1/r attractive force (to test particles of positive mass) but zero integrated mass over a large volume of space, was proposed to solve the dark matter problem in bound structures but not cosmic expansion. The idea also involved a negative density, which is not present in the current model.</description>

      <title>Bananas are Unparticles: Differential Equations and Cosmological Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an exact correspondence between tree-level cosmological correlators with unparticle exchange (at integer scaling dimensions) and banana diagrams of conformally coupled scalars. This duality enables us to systematically solve the governing differential equations through the application of shift relations and de Sitter bootstrap techniques. Furthermore, we adapt a dimensional regularization scheme to cosmological correlators, demonstrating how renormalization conditions uniquely fix the regularization prescription. Our results provide new insights into the analytic structure of higher-order loop corrections to inflationary correlation functions.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) I: Discovery of &gt;100 high redshift strong lenses in contiguous JWST imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS), a sample of over 100 strong lens candidates from the $0.54$\,deg$^2$ COSMOS-Web survey, discovered using exquisite James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging across four wavebands. Following two rounds of visual inspection, over 100 candidates were ranked as `high confidence' or `likely' by at least $50\%$ of inspectors. The COWLS sample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning redshifts $z \sim 0.1$ to $z \sim 9$, which therefore extend into the epoch of reionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy density profile evolution studies beyond $z \sim 2$; (iii) all lenses are distributed within a contiguous $0.54$\,deg$^2$ region, allowing for joint strong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source emission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of supermassive black holes and dust absorption. A key innovation of our approach is the use of lens modelling to aid in identifying lenses that may otherwise be missed. This paper is accompanied by the first COWLS public release, providing JWST NIRCam imaging in four bands, lens models, pixelized source reconstructions and lens redshift estimates : https://github.com/Jammy2211/COWLS_COSMOS_Web_Lens_Survey</description>

      <title>New constraints on the galactic ionizing efficiency and escape fraction at 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 based on quasar absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can probe the sources of the extragalactic ionizing background. We provide new measurements of the ionizing emissivity of galaxies using measurements of the ionizing background and ionizing photon mean free path from high-redshift quasar spectra at $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$. Unlike most prior works, we account for radiative-transfer effects and possible neutral islands from the tail of reionization at $z &gt; 5$. We combine our results with measurements of the UV luminosity function to constrain the average escaping ionizing efficiency of galaxies, $\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}$. Assuming galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$ emit ionizing photons, we find $\log (\langle f_{\rm esc} \xi_{\rm ion}\rangle_{L_{\rm UV}}/{\rm erg^{-1}Hz}) = 24.47_{-0.17}^{+0.09}$ and $24.75_{-0.28}^{+0.15}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $24.48$ and $24.31$ at $z = 2.5$ and $4$, respectively. We also estimate the population-averaged $f_{\rm esc}$ using measurements of intrinsic ionizing efficiency from JWST. We find $\langle f_{\rm esc} \rangle = 0.126_{-0.041}^{+0.034}$ and $0.224_{-0.108}^{+0.098}$ at $z=5$ and $6$, and $1\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{\rm esc}&lt; 0.138$ and $0.096$ at $z=2.5$ and $4$, respectively, for $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -11$. Our findings are consistent with prior measurements of $f_{\rm esc} \lesssim 10\%$ at $z \leq 4$, but indicate a factor of several increase between $z = 4$ and $6$. The steepness of this evolution is sensitive to the highly uncertain mean free path and ionizing background intensity at $z&gt;5$. Lastly, we find $1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.39}$ photons per H atom are emitted into the IGM between $z=6$ and $=5.3$. This is $\approx 4\times$ more than needed to complete the last $20\%$ of reionization absent recombinations, suggesting that reionization's end was likely absorption-dominated.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) II: depth, resolution, and NIR coverage from JWST reveal 17 spectacular lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) presents the first systematic search for strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web field using data from the \textit{James Webb} Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}). Using high-resolution NIRCam imaging, we visually inspected over 42\,660 galaxies and identified over 400 lensing candidates. From this sample and based on \textit{JWST}/NIRCam imaging only, we report here the 17 most obvious and spectacular strong lensing systems. These lenses, characterised by large Einstein rings and arcs and their distinct lens and source colours, were found through only the visual inspection of the lens-light-subtracted image data and were immediately visible due to their spectacular appearance. We showcase how spectacular strong lenses are at the extremes of lens parameter space. Their exceptionally high signal-to-noise, multi-wavelength imaging enables unprecedented lensing analysis, including `\textit{HST}-dark' source galaxies that are also invisible in the deeper bluer \textit{JWST} wavebands, enabling clean deblending between the lens and the source. Sources may exhibit dramatic morphological changes across wavelengths, and dust absorption within lenses may be detectable by eye. No other instrument, including the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope, can discover or image such lenses with comparable detail. We estimate that \textit{JWST} uncovers a new spectacular lens approximately every 10 to 12 NIRCam pointings, suggesting that over 40 such lenses remain undetected within its first three years of observations. All COWLS data is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) III: forecasts versus data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare forecasts for the abundance and properties of strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web survey, a $0.54$ deg$^2$ survey of the COSMOS field using the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard JWST, with the first catalogue of strong lens candidates identified in the observed NIRCam data, COWLS. We modify the lenspop package to produce a forecast for strong lensing in COSMOS-Web. We add a new mock galaxy catalogue to use as the source population, as well as the COSMOS-Web survey specifications, including the transmission data for the four NIRCam filters used. We forecast 107 strong lenses can be detected in COSMOS-Web across all bands, assuming complete subtraction of the lens galaxy light. The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} &lt; 1$ arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between $0 &lt; z &lt;2$, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim 3$ and has a long tail extending up to $z \sim 11$, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation. We compare our forecast with the distributions of Einstein radii, lens photometric redshifts, and lens and source magnitudes in the observed lenses, finding that whilst the forecast and observed Einstein radii distributions match, the redshifts and magnitudes do not. The observed lens redshift distribution peaks at a slightly lower redshift than the forecast one, whilst the lens magnitudes are systematically brighter in the observed data than in the forecast. Assuming the validity of the lenspop forecast, this finding motivates further inspection of the COWLS data to search for the as-yet undiscovered population of faint, high-redshift lenses.</description>

      <title>FAST Discovery of A Gas-rich and Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy: KK153</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a high-sensitivity HI survey using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we identified an isolated HI cloud with a system velocity of ~127.0 km/s, which is associated with an optical galaxy KK153 in space. The HI gas of KK153 shows a typical disk-galaxy structure. Using the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we obtained that the distance to KK153 is 2.0_{-0.8}^{+1.7} Mpc. Adopting such distance, we derived a stellar mass of 4.1_{-2.6}^{+10.0}*10^{5} Msun and a neutral gas fraction of 0.63, implying that KK153 is a gas-rich ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy in the Local Group or its outskirts. KK153 shows a cool (~200 K) and warm (~7400 K) two-phase neutral medium. The g-r color distribution of KK153 suggests that new stars are mostly forming in its inner disk. The dynamical mass of KK153 is 6.9_{-3.0}^{+5.5}*10^{7} Msun, which is about 60 times larger than its baryonic matter. Detection of such a low-mass and gas-rich halo poses a challenge to the theory of cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>The SAMI Galaxy Survey: large-scale environment affects galaxy spin amplitudes and the formation of slow rotators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the large-scale 3D density field, as defined by deep, wide-field galaxy surveys, on stellar spin ($\lambda_{\rm R_e}$) and the distributions of fast and slow rotators. We use the GAMA spectroscopic redshift survey to reconstruct the cosmic web and obtain spatially-resolved stellar kinematics from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. Among various local and large-scale environment metrics, the distance to the closest filament ($D_{\rm fil}$) correlates most significantly with $\lambda_{\rm R_e}$, but it is secondary to the more dominant roles played by stellar age and mass. Fast rotators tend to have increasing $\lambda_{\rm R_e}$ going from nodes to filaments to voids, independently of mass. Slow rotators and mass-matched fast rotators are found to have significantly different distributions of large-scale environment metrics but consistent distributions of local environment metrics. About 95% of slow rotators have $D_{\rm fil}\leq2$Mpc, while covering broader ranges (similar to fast rotators) in distance to nodes and voids, local galaxy density, halo mass, and position with respect to the halo. At fixed mass, the fraction of slow rotators, $f_{\rm SR}$, increases for smaller $D_{\rm fil}$, especially for massive galaxies. While controlling for age or mass, only galaxies very close to filaments and nodes show a significant impact of local environment on $f_{\rm SR}$. Our results demonstrate that the cosmic web leaves an imprint on galactic spin amplitudes, and that pre-processing by mergers occurring within filaments is likely to be an important physical mechanism for the formation of slow rotators before they reach nodes.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Quasi-Normal Modes of the Schwarzschild Black Hole from the Penrose Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Penrose limit connects a plane wave geometry to the photon ring of a black hole, where the quasi-normal modes are located in the eikonal limit. Utilizing this simplification, we analytically extract the quadratic-level non-linearities in the quasi-normal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole for the $(\ell\times\ell)\to 2\ell$ channel. We demonstrate that this result is independent of $\ell$ and further confirm it through symmetry arguments.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations analyses with Density-Split Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling for the evolution of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is essential for using it as a standard ruler to probe cosmology. We explore the non-linearity of the BAO in different environments using the density-split statistics and compare them to the case of the conventional two-point correlation function (2PCF). We detect density-dependent shifts for the position of the BAO with respect to its linear version using halos from N-body simulations. Around low/high-densities, the scale of the BAO expands/contracts due to non-linear peculiar velocities. As the simulation evolves from redshift 1 to 0, the difference in the magnitude of the shifts between high- and low-dense regions increases from the sub-percent to the percent level. The width of the BAO around high density regions increases as the universe evolves, similar to the known broadening of the BAO in the 2PCF due to non-linear evolution. In contrast, the width is smaller and stable for low density regions. We discuss possible implications for the reconstructions of the BAO in light of our results.</description>

      <title>Reduction of the type Ia supernova host galaxy step in the outer regions of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 1533 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the five-year sample of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we investigate the relationship between the projected galactocentric separation of the SNe and their host galaxies and their light curves and standardization. We show, for the first time, that the difference in SN Ia post-standardization brightnesses between high and low-mass hosts reduces from $0.078\pm0.011$\,mag in the full sample to $0.036 \pm 0.018$\,mag for SNe Ia located in the outer regions of their host galaxies, while increasing to $0.100 \pm 0.014$\,mag for SNe in the inner regions. The difference in the size of the mass step between inner and outer regions is $0.064\pm0.023$\,mag. In these inner regions, the step can be reduced (but not removed) using a model where the $R_V$ of dust along the line-of-sight to the SN changes as a function of galaxy properties. We investigate the remaining difference using the distributions of the SN Ia stretch parameter to test the inferred age of SN progenitors. Comparing red (older) environments only, outer regions have a higher proportion of high-stretch SNe and a more homogeneous stretch distribution. However, this effect cannot explain the reduction in significance of any Hubble residual step in outer regions. We conclude that the standardized distances of SNe Ia located in the outer regions of galaxies are less affected by their global host galaxy properties than those in the inner regions.</description>

      <title>Kinetic field theory: effects of modified gravity theories with screening mechanisms on non-linear cosmic density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a mean-field approximation within Kinetic Field Theory, it is possible to derive an accurate analytic expression for the power spectrum of present-day non-linear cosmic density fluctuations. It depends on the theory of gravity and the cosmological model via the expansion function of the background space-time, the growth factor derived from it, and the gravitational coupling strength, which may deviate from Newton's constant in a manner depending on time and spatial scale. In earlier work [1], we introduced a functional Taylor expansion around general relativity and the cosmological standard model to derive the effects of a wide class of modified-gravity theories on the non-linear power spectrum, assuming that such effects need to be small given the general success of the standard model. Here, we extend this class towards theories with small-scale screening, modeling screening effects by a suitably flexible interpolating function. We compare the Taylor expansion with full mean-field solutions and find good agreement where expected. We find typical relative enhancements of the non-linear power spectrum between a few and a few ten per cent in a broad range of wave numbers between $k\gtrsim0.1-10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, in good qualitative agreement with results of numerical simulations. Taking nDGP gravity as a quantitative example we compare our results to N-body simulations and find percent-level agreement for wavenumbers $k\lesssim 2\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, if the scale where screening sets in, $k^*$, is adapted appropriately. This extends the application of our analytic approach to non-linear cosmic structure formation to essentially all classes of modified-gravity theories.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 V: Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering from Galaxies and Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the measurements and cosmological implications of the galaxy two-point clustering using over 4.7 million unique galaxy and quasar redshifts in the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;2.1$ divided into six redshift bins over a $\sim 7,500$ square degree footprint, from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). By fitting the full power spectrum, we extend previous DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements to include redshift-space distortions and signals from the matter-radiation equality scale. For the first time, this Full-Shape analysis is blinded at the catalogue-level to avoid confirmation bias and the systematic errors are accounted for at the two-point clustering level, which automatically propagates them into any cosmological parameter. When analysing the data in terms of compressed model-agnostic variables, we obtain a combined precision of 4.7\% on the amplitude of the redshift space distortion signal reaching similar precision with just one year of DESI data than with 20 years of observation from previous generation surveys. We analyse the data to directly constrain the cosmological parameters within the $\Lambda$CDM model using perturbation theory and combine this information with the reconstructed DESI DR1 galaxy BAO. Using a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Gaussian prior on the baryon density parameter, and a Gaussian prior on the spectral index, we constrain the matter density is $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.010 $ and the Hubble constant $H_0=(68.63 \pm 0.79)[{\rm km\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}]$. Additionally, we measure the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.841 \pm 0.034$. The DESI DR1 results are in agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM model based on general relativity with parameters consistent with those from Planck. The cosmological interpretation of these results in combination with external datasets are presented in a companion paper.</description>

Abstract: The estimation of uncertainties in cosmological parameters is an important challenge in Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) analyses. For standard analyses such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Full Shape, two approaches are usually considered. First: analytical estimates of the covariance matrix use Gaussian approximations and (nonlinear) clustering measurements to estimate the matrix, which allows a relatively fast and computationally cheap way to generate matrices that adapt to an arbitrary clustering measurement. On the other hand, sample covariances are an empirical estimate of the matrix based on en ensemble of clustering measurements from fast and approximate simulations. While more computationally expensive due to the large amount of simulations and volume required, these allow us to take into account systematics that are impossible to model analytically. In this work we compare these two approaches in order to enable DESI's key analyses. We find that the configuration space analytical estimate performs satisfactorily in BAO analyses and its flexibility in terms of input clustering makes it the fiducial choice for DESI's 2024 BAO analysis. On the contrary, the analytical computation of the covariance matrix in Fourier space does not reproduce the expected measurements in terms of Full Shape analyses, which motivates the use of a corrected mock covariance for DESI's Full Shape analysis.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Low Frequency Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background: Constraints from Quasars and the Astrometric Hellings-Downs Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new astrometric constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background and construct the first astrometric Hellings-Downs curve using quasar proper motions. From quadrupolar vector spherical harmonic fits to the Gaia proper motions of 1,108,858 quasars, we obtain a frequency-integrated upper limit on the gravitational wave energy density, $h_{70}^2\Omega_{GW} \leq 0.023$ (95% confidence limit), for frequencies between 11.2 nHz and $3.1\times10^{-9}$ nHz ($1.33/t_0$). However, from the astrometric Hellings-Downs curve that describes the correlated proper motions between 2,104,609,881 quasar pairs as a function of their angular separation, we find a stronger constraint: a characteristic strain of $h_{c} \leq 2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ for $f_{\rm ref} = 1$ yr$^{-1}$ and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{\rm GW} \leq 0.0096$ at 95% confidence. We probe down to $\pm$0.005 $\mu$as$^2$ yr$^{-2}$ in correlated power and obtain the lowest astrometric limit to date. This is also the first time that optical wavelength astrometry surpasses limits from radio-frequency interferometry. This astrometric analysis does not yet reach the sensitivity needed to detect the pulsar timing-based red gravitational wave spectrum extrapolated to the quasar gravitational wave sensitivity window, assuming that the turnover in the spectrum occurs at $\sim$1 nHz for massive black hole binaries. The limits presented here may exclude some exotic interpretations of the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By reducing variance induced by gravitational lensing, likelihood-based de-lensing techniques have true potential to extract significantly more information from deep and high-resolution Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data than traditional methods. We derive here optimal data compression statistics for the lensed CMB, and clarify the role of each term, demonstrating their direct analogs in the quadratic estimator (QE) framework. We discuss in this light pros and cons of practical implementations, including the MUSE approach, as used in the latest SPT-3G cosmological analysis, and give improvements. We discuss pathways for porting the large robustness and redundancy toolbox of the QE approach to beyond-QE with simple means.</description>

Abstract: We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</description>

      <title>A Hubble Constant Determination Through Quasar Time Delays and Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model-independent constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) by anchoring relative distances from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations to absolute distance measurements from time-delay strong Gravitational Lensing (SGL) systems. The approach only uses the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) to derive constraints on $H_0$. By using Gaussian Process (GP) regression to reconstruct the unanchored luminosity distance from the Pantheon$+$ compilation to match the time-delay angular diameter distance at the redshift of the lenses, one yields a value of $H_0 = 75.57 \pm 4.415$ km/s/Mpc at a 68\% confidence level. The result aligns well with the local estimate from Cepheid variables within the $1\sigma$ confidence region, indicating consistency with late-universe probes.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from compact binary coalescenses with resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims at clarifying the situation about astrophysical sources that might be observed with haloscope experiments sensitive to gravitational waves in the 1-10 GHz band. The GrAHal setup is taken as a benchmark. We follow a very pedagogical path so that the full analysis can easily be used by the entire community who might not be familiar with the theoretical framework. Different relevant physical regimes are considered in details and some formulas encountered in the literature are revised. In particular, we carefully take into account the fast drift of the gravitational wave frequency and the relevant experimental timescales. We also relax the usual assumption that only the merging phase should be considered. The distances that can be probed and expected event rates are carefully evaluated, taking into account degeneracies between physical parameters. We show where experimental efforts should be focused to improve the sensitivity and we conclude that any detection in the near future is extremely unlikely.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling of Polarized Atmosphere at the South Pole with SPT-3G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the detection and characterization of fluctuations in linearly polarized emission from the atmosphere above the South Pole. These measurements make use of data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope in three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We use the cross-correlation between detectors to produce an unbiased estimate of the power in Stokes I, Q, and U parameters on large angular scales. Our results are consistent with the polarized signal being produced by the combination of Rayleigh scattering of thermal radiation from the ground and thermal emission from a population of horizontally aligned ice crystals with an anisotropic distribution described by Kolmogorov turbulence. The measured spatial scaling, frequency scaling, and elevation dependence of the polarized emission are explained by this model. Polarized atmospheric emission has the potential to significantly impact observations on the large angular scales being targeted by searches for inflationary B-mode CMB polarization. We present the distribution of measured angular power spectrum amplitudes in Stokes Q and I for 4 yr of Austral winter observations, which can be used to simulate the impact of atmospheric polarization and intensity fluctuations at the South Pole on a specified experiment and observation strategy. We present a mitigation strategy that involves both downweighting significantly contaminated observations and subtracting a polarized atmospheric signal from the 150 GHz band maps. In observations with the SPT-3G instrument, the polarized atmospheric signal is a well-understood and subdominant contribution to the measured noise after implementing the mitigation strategies described here.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Gravitinos Through Large-Scale Structure Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim 25~(11)\text{ GeV}$ at $95\%\text{ C.L.}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Berry phase in axion physics, SM global structure, and generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-photon and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in both systems share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase and providing a novel perspective on axion experiments. We conceptually propose a new photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase offers a unique method for probing the global structure of the Standard Model gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Active Learning for optimised spectroscopic follow-up: Enhancing early SN Ia classification with the Fink broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current and future surveys rely on machine learning classification to obtain large and complete samples of transients. Many of these algorithms are restricted by training samples that contain a limited number of spectroscopically confirmed events. Here, we present the first real-time application of Active Learning to optimise spectroscopic follow-up with the goal of improving training sets of early type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) classifiers. Using a photometric classifier for early SN Ia, we apply an Active Learning strategy for follow-up optimisation using the real-time FINK broker processing of the ZTF public stream. We perform follow-up observations at the ANU 2.3m telescope in Australia and obtain 92 spectroscopic classified events that are incorporated in our training set. We show that our follow-up strategy yields a training set that, with 25% less spectra, improves classification metrics when compared to publicly reported spectra. Our strategy selects in average fainter events and, not only supernovae types, but also microlensing events and flaring stars which are usually not incorporated on training sets. Our results confirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies to construct optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. With the Rubin Observatory LSST soon online, we propose improvements to obtain earlier candidates and optimise follow-up. This work paves the way to the deployment of real-time AL follow-up strategies in the era of large surveys.</description>
