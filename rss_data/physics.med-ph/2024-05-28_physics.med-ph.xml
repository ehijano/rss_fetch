      <title>Dual-ratio approach to pulse oximetry and the effect of skin tone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Pulsatile blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2 ) via pulse oximetry is a valuable clinical metric for assessing oxygen delivery. Individual anatomical features, including skin tone, may affect current optical pulse oximetry methods.
  Aim: Develop an optical pulse oximetry method based on Dual-Ratio (DR) measurements to suppress individual anatomical features on SpO2.
  Approach: Design a DR-based finger pulse oximeter, hypothesizing that DR would suppress confounds from optical coupling and superficial tissue-absorption. This method is tested using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and in vivo experiments.
  Results: Different melanosome volume fraction in the epidermis, a surrogate for skin tone, cause changes in the recovered SpO2 on the order of 1%. Different heterogeneous pulsatile hemodynamics cause greater changes on the order of 10%. SpO2 recovered with DR measurements showed less variability than the traditional Single-Distance (SD) transmission method.
  Conclusions: For the models and methods considered here, SpO2 measurements are more strongly impacted by heterogeneous pulsatile hemodynamics than by melanosome volume fraction. This is consistent with previous reports that, the skin tone bias is smaller than the observed variation in recovered SpO 2 across individual people. The partial suppression of variability in the SpO2 recovered by DR suggests promise of DR for pulse oximetry.</description>

      <title>Deep learning improved autofocus for motion artifact reduction and its application in quantitative susceptibility mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a pipeline for motion artifact correction in mGRE and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Methods: Deep learning is integrated with autofocus to improve motion artifact suppression, which is applied QSM of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The estimation of affine motion parameters in the autofocus method depends on signal-to-noise ratio and lacks accuracy when data sampling occurs outside the k-space center. A deep learning strategy is employed to remove the residual motion artifacts in autofocus. Results: Results obtained in simulated brain data (n =15) with reference truth show that the proposed autofocus deep learning method significantly improves the image quality of mGRE and QSM (p = 0.001 for SSIM, p &lt; 0.0001 for PSNR and RMSE). Results from 10 PD patients with real motion artifacts in QSM have also been corrected using the proposed method and sent to an experienced radiologist for image quality evaluation, and the average image quality score has increased (p=0.0039). Conclusions: The proposed method enables substantial suppression of motion artifacts in mGRE and QSM.</description>

      <title>MRI lung lobe segmentation in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients using a recurrent neural network trained with publicly accessible CT datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13754v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce a widely applicable workflow for pulmonary lobe segmentation of MR images using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with chest computed tomography (CT) datasets. The feasibility is demonstrated for 2D coronal ultra-fast balanced steady-state free precession (ufSSFP) MRI.
  Methods: Lung lobes of 250 publicly accessible CT datasets of adults were segmented with an open-source CT-specific algorithm. To match 2D ufSSFP MRI data of pediatric patients, both CT data and segmentations were translated into pseudo-MR images, masked to suppress anatomy outside the lung. Network-1 was trained with pseudo-MR images and lobe segmentations, and applied to 1000 masked ufSSFP images to predict lobe segmentations. These outputs were directly used as targets to train Network-2 and Network-3 with non-masked ufSSFP data as inputs, and an additional whole-lung mask as input for Network-2. Network predictions were compared to reference manual lobe segmentations of ufSSFP data in twenty pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. Manual lobe segmentations were performed by splitting available whole-lung segmentations into lobes.
  Results: Network-1 was able to segment the lobes of ufSSFP images, and Network-2 and Network-3 further increased segmentation accuracy and robustness. The average all-lobe Dice similarity coefficients were 95.0$\pm$2.8 (mean$\pm$pooled SD [%]), 96.4$\pm$2.0, 93.0$\pm$2.0, and the average median Hausdorff distances were 6.1$\pm$0.9 (mean$\pm$SD [mm]), 5.3$\pm$1.1, 7.1$\pm$1.3, for Network-1, Network-2, and Network-3, respectively.
  Conclusions: RNN lung lobe segmentation of 2D ufSSFP imaging is feasible, in good agreement with manual segmentations. The proposed workflow might provide access to automated lobe segmentations for various lung MRI examinations and quantitative analyses.</description>

      <title>An automated pipeline for computation and analysis of functional ventilation and perfusion lung MRI with matrix pencil decomposition: TrueLung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce and evaluate TrueLung, an automated pipeline for computation and analysis of free-breathing and contrast-agent free pulmonary functional MRI.
  Material and Methods: time-resolved ultra-fast bSSFP acquisitions are transferred to TrueLung, which includes image quality checks, image registration, and computation of perfusion and ventilation maps with matrix pencil decomposition. Neural network whole-lung and lobar segmentations allow quantification of impaired relative perfusion (RQ) and fractional ventilation (RFV). TrueLung delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes, reported for clinicians in concise documents. We evaluated the pipeline in 75 cystic fibrosis children. Whole-lung and lobar segmentations were manually refined when necessary, and the impact on RQ and RFV was quantified.
  Results: Functional imaging was performed at 7.9 $\pm$ 1.8 (mean $\pm$ SD) coronal slice positions per patient, totaling on average 6min 20s scan time per patient. The whole pipeline required 20min calculation time per subject. TrueLung delivered the functional maps of all the subjects for radiological assessment. Quality controlling maps and segmentations lasted 1min 12s per patient. The automated segmentations and quantification of whole-lung defects were satisfying in 88% of patients (97% of slices) and the lobar quantification in 73% (93% of slices). The segmentations refinements required 16s per patient for the whole-lung, and 2min 10s for the lobe masks. The relative differences in RFV and RQ between fully-automated and manually refined data were marginal.
  Conclusions: TrueLung quickly delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes in an objective and standardized way, suitable for radiological and pneumological assessment with minimal manual input. TrueLung can be used for clinical research in cystic fibrosis and might be applied across various lung diseases.</description>

      <title>Exploring UMAP in hybrid models of entropy-based and representativeness sampling for active learning in biomedical segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study various hybrid models of entropy-based and representativeness sampling techniques in the context of active learning in medical segmentation, in particular examining the role of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) as a technique for capturing representativeness. Although UMAP has been shown viable as a general purpose dimension reduction method in diverse areas, its role in deep learning-based medical segmentation has yet been extensively explored. Using the cardiac and prostate datasets in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon for validation, we found that a novel hybrid combination of Entropy-UMAP sampling technique achieved a statistically significant Dice score advantage over the random baseline ($3.2 \%$ for cardiac, $4.5 \%$ for prostate), and attained the highest Dice coefficient among the spectrum of 10 distinct active learning methodologies we examined. This provides preliminary evidence that there is an interesting synergy between entropy-based and UMAP methods when the former precedes the latter in a hybrid model of active learning.</description>
