      <title>Multiple nodal solutions of planar Stein-Weiss equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our goal is to investigate the existence of multiple nodal solutions to a class of planar Stein-Weiss problems involving a nonlinearity $f$ with subcritical or critical growth in the sense of Trudinger-Moser. To achieve this, we combine a gluing approach with the Nehari manifold argument. We demonstrate that for any positive integer $k\in \mathbb{N}$, the problem studied has at least one radially symmetrical ground state solution that changes sign exactly $k$-times.</description>

      <title>A-priori estimates for generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations in $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local-in-time a-priori estimates in $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R})$ for a family of generalized Korteweg--de Vries equations. This is the first estimate for any non-integrable perturbation of the KdV equation that matches the regularity of the sharp well-posedness theory for KdV. In particular, we show that our analysis applies to models for long waves in a shallow channel of water with an uneven bottom.
  The proof of our main result is based upon a bootstrap argument for the renormalized perturbation determinant coupled with a local smoothing norm.</description>

      <title>Refined regularity for nonlocal elliptic equations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish refined regularity estimates for nonnegative solutions to the fractional Poisson equation $$ (-\Delta)^s u(x) =f(x),\,\, x\in B_1(0). $$ Specifically, we have derived H\"{o}lder, Schauder, and Ln-Lipschitz regularity estimates for any nonnegative solution $u,$ provided that only the local $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ is bounded. These estimates stand in sharp contrast to the existing results where the global $L^\infty$ norm of $u$ is required. Our findings indicate that the local values of the solution $u$ and $f$ are sufficient to control the local values of higher order derivatives of $u$. Notably, this makes it possible to establish a priori estimates in unbounded domains by using blowing up and re-scaling argument.
  As applications, we derive singularity and decay estimates for solutions to some super-linear nonlocal problems in unbounded domains, and in particular, we obtain a priori estimates for a family of fractional Lane-Emden type equations in $\mathbb{R}^n.$ This is achieved by adopting a different method using auxiliary functions, which is applicable to both local and nonlocal problems.</description>

      <title>Monge solutions of time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a classical notion equivalent to viscosity solutions, Monge solutions are well understood for stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equations in Euclidean spaces and have been recently studied in general metric spaces. In this paper, we introduce a notion of Monge solutions for time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces. The key idea is to reformulate the equation as a stationary problem under the assumption of Lipschitz regularity for the initial data. We establish the uniqueness and existence of bounded Lipschitz Monge solutions to the initial value problem and discuss their equivalence with existing notions of metric viscosity solutions.</description>

      <title>An Onsager type theorem for the Euler-Boussinesq equations in two spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct non-trivial weak solutions $(v, \theta)$ to the inviscid Euler-Boussinesq system in two spatial dimensions. These solutions exhibit compact temporal support, thereby violating the conservation of the temperature's $L^p$-norm. Furthermore, the pair $(v, \theta)$ resides in the H\"older space $C^\gamma(\mathbb R \times \mathbb T^2) \times C^\gamma (\mathbb R \times \mathbb T^2)$ for any exponent $\gamma&lt;1/3$. The methodology integrates a Nash iteration scheme with a linear decoupling technique to achieve these results.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity for solutions to semilinear problems in epigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider positive solutions, possibly unbounded, to the semilinear equation $-\Delta u=f(u)$ on continuous epigraphs bounded from below. Under the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, we prove new monotonicity results for $u$, when $f$ is a (locally or globally) Lipschitz-continuous function satisfying $ f(0) \geq 0$. As an application of our new monotonicity theorems, we prove some classification and/or non-existence results. To prove our results, we first establish some new comparison principles for semilinear problems on general unbounded open sets of $\mathbb{R}^N$, and then we use them to start and to complete a modified version of the moving plane method adapted to the geometry of the epigraph $\Omega$. As a by-product of our analysis, we also prove some new results of uniqueness and symmetry for solutions (possibly unbounded and sign-changing) to the homogeneous Dirichlet BVP for the semilinear Poisson equation in fairly general unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Serrin's overdetermined problems on epigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish some rigidity results for Serrin's overdetermined problem \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{cll}
  - \Delta u=f(u) &amp; \text{in}&amp; \Omega,\newline
  u &gt; 0&amp; \text{in} &amp; \Omega,\newline
  u=0 &amp; \text{on} &amp; \partial \Omega,\newline
  \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial \eta} = \mathfrak{c} = const. &amp; \text{on} &amp; \partial \Omega,
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation*}
  when $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is an epigraph (not necessarily globally Lipschitz-continuous) and $u$ is a classical solution, possibly unbounded. In broad terms, our main results prove that $\Omega$ must be an affine half-space and $u$ must be one-dimensional, provided the epigraph is bounded from below. These results hold when $f$ is of Allen-Cahn type and $ N \geq 2$ or, alternatively, when $f$ is locally Lipschitz-continuous (with no restriction on the sign of $f(0)$) and $ N \leq 3$. These results partially answer a question raised by Berestycki, Caffarelli and Nirenberg in [1]. Finally, when $f(0) &lt;0$, we also prove a new monotonicity result, valid in any dimension $ N \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>A time-dependent inverse source problem for a semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation with Neumann boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inverse problem for determining an unknown time-dependent source coefficient in a semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation with variable coefficients and Neumann boundary condition. This unknown source term is recovered from the integral measurement over the domain $\Omega$. Based on Rothe's method, the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution, under suitable assumptions on the data, is established. A numerical time-discrete scheme for the unique weak solution and the unknown source coefficient is designed, and the convergence of the approximations is proved. Some numerical experiments are presented to support the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Null coordinates for quasi-periodic $(1+1)$-dimensional wave operators on the circle with applications to reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any wave operator with principle part $\partial_{t}^2 -\partial_{x}^2 +\mathcal{B}^{xx}(\omega t,x)\partial_{x}^2$, where $\mathcal{B}^{xx}:\mathbb{T}^{\nu+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a sufficiently small, quasi-periodic perturbation and $\omega \in \mathbb{R}^\nu$, we explain how to construct \emph{null coordinates} that respect the quasi-periodicity of the solutions. As it turns out, in these coordinates, the principal symbol of the wave operator above has constant coefficients. To construct these coordinates, we start by writing the wave operator in geometric form, modulo terms of order $1$, meaning as the wave operator arising from an $(1+1)$-Lorentzian metric and then define null coordinates as solutions to the Eikonal equations, so that the metric is conformally flat in these coordinates. The problem of constructing these coordinates is then eventually reduced to that of straightening a vector field with quasi-periodic coefficients. As an application, we give a novel proof of a recent reducibility result of Berti-Feola-Procesi-Terracina for the quasi-periodically forced linear Klein-Gordon equation, the novelty concerning essentially the analysis of the maximal order terms. In particular, the method we propose here does not rely on any quantitative Egorov-type result.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of (nonlinear) rough continuity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to fluid dynamics, we study rough differential equations (RDEs) and rough partial differential equations (RPDEs) with non-Lipschitz drifts. We prove well-posedness and existence of a flow for RDEs with Osgood drifts, as well as well-posedness of weak $L^p$-valued solutions to linear rough continuity and transport equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ under DiPerna--Lions regularity conditions; a combination of the two then yields flow representation formula for linear RPDEs. We apply these results to obtain existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence for $L^1\cap L^\infty$-valued solutions to a general class of nonlinear continuity equations. In particular, our framework covers the $2$D Euler equations in vorticity form with rough transport noise, providing a rough analogue of Yudovich's theorem. As a consequence, we construct an associated continuous random dynamical system, when the driving noise is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (1/3,1)$. We further prove weak existence of solutions for initial vorticities in $L^1\cap L^p$, for any $p\in [1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in the horizontal annulus: critical Rayleigh number for the steady problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the 2D Oberbeck-Boussinesq system in an annulus we are looking for the critical Rayleigh number for which the (nonzero) basic flow loses stability. For this we consider the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations and construct a precise functional analytical frame for the Laplace- and the Stokes problem as well as the Bilaplacian operator in this domain. With this frame and the right set of basis functions it is then possible to construct and apply a numerical scheme providing the critical Rayleigh number.</description>

      <title>Metaplectic operators with quasi-diagonal kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaplectic operators form a relevant class of operators appearing in different applications, in the present work we study their Schwartz kernels. Namely, diagonality of a kernel is defined by imposing rapid off-diagonal decay conditions, and quasi-diagonality by imposing the same conditions on the smoothing of the kernel through convolution with the Gaussian. Kernels of metaplectic operators are not diagonal. Nevertheless, as we shall prove, they are quasi-diagonal under suitable conditions. Motivation for our study comes from problems in time-frequency analysis, that we discuss in the last section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the Parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. The argument was made in direct mode, showing that it is possible to bypass Fourier analysis, which was used in all previous work with rough initial conditions. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using the good structure of our noise, we obtain new exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification). Numerical examples are provided for two-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Finite volume element method for Landau-Lifshitz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz equation describes the dynamics of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Due to the essential nonlinearity and nonconvex constraint, it is typically solved numerically. In this paper, we developed a finite volume element method (FVEM) with the Gauss-Seidel projection method (GSPM) for the micromagnetics simulations. We give the error estimate for FVEM in space and depict the discretized energy dissipation. Owing to the application of the GSPM, the nonlinear vector system is decoupled and the computational complexity is comparable to that of implicitly solving the scalar heat equation, which accelerates the real simulations significantly. We present several numerical experiments to verify the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we study the blow-up solution and efficiently simulate the 2D magnetic textures using the proposed method.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ Theory from many-body quantum Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on the torus as a rigorous limit of the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas, where the limiting classical measure describes the critical behavior of the Bose gas just above the Bose--Einstein phase transition. Since the quantum problem is typically formulated using a nonlocal interaction potential, a key challenge is to approximate the local $\Phi^4_3$ theory by a Hartree measure with a nonlocal interaction. This requires uniform estimates on the Hartree measure, which are achieved using techniques from recent development on stochastic quantization and paracontrolled calculus from \cite{GIP15}. The connection to the quantum problem is then established by applying the variational approach in \cite{LewNamRou-21}, where using a recent correlation inequality from \cite{DeuNamNap-25} we refine the analysis and derive a quantitative convergence of the quantum correlation functions to those of the Hartree classical field.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete linear hyperbolic polyharmonic flows of closed polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the damped hyperbolic motion of polygons by a linear semi-discrete analogue of polyharmonic curve diffusion. We show that such flows may transition any polygon to any other polygon, reminiscent of the Yau problem of evolving one curve to another by a curvature flow, before converging exponentially to a point that, under appropriate rescaling, is a planar basis polygon. We also consider a hyperbolic linear semi-discrete flow of the Yau curvature difference flow, where a polygonal curve is able to flow to any other such that we get convergence to the target polygon in infinite time.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal perimeters and variations: Extremality and decomposability for finite and infinite horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the extremality and decomposability properties with respect to two types of nonlocal perimeters available in the literature, the Gagliardo perimeter based on the eponymous seminorms and the nonlocal distributional Caccioppoli perimeter, both with finite and infinite interaction ranges. A nonlocal notion of indecomposability associated to these perimeters is introduced, and we prove that in both cases it can be characterized solely in terms of the interaction range or horizon $\varepsilon$. Utilizing this, we show that it is possible to uniquely decompose a set into its $\varepsilon$-connected components, establishing a nonlocal analogue of the decomposition theorem of Ambrosio, Caselles, Masnou and Morel. Moreover, the extreme points of the balls induced by the Gagliardo and nonlocal total variation seminorm are identified, which naturally correspond to the two nonlocal perimeters. Surprisingly, while the extreme points in the former case are normalized indicator functions of $\varepsilon$-simple sets, akin to the classical TV-ball, in the latter case they are instead obtained from a nonlocal transformation applied to the extreme points of the TV-ball. Finally, we explore the nonlocal-to-local transition via a $\Gamma$-limit as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ for both perimeters, recovering the classical Caccioppoli perimeter.</description>

      <title>Robin Hood model versus Sheriff of Nottingham model: transfers in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of transfers in a population structured by a continuous variable corresponding to the quantity being transferred. The model takes the form of an integro-differential equations with kernels corresponding to the specific rules of the transfer process. We focus our interest on the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the space of measures. We characterize transfer kernels that give a continuous semiflow in the space of measures and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the space $L^1$ of integrable functions. We construct some examples of kernels that may be particularly interesting in economic applications. Our model considers blind transfers of economic value (e.g. money) between individuals. The two models are the ``Robin Hood model'', where the richest individual unconditionally gives a fraction of their wealth to the poorest when a transfer occurs, and the other extreme, the ``Sheriff of Nottingham model'', where the richest unconditionally takes a fraction of the poorest's wealth. Between these two extreme cases is a continuum of intermediate models obtained by interpolating the kernels. We illustrate those models with numerical simulations and show that any small fraction of the ``Sheriff of Nottingham'' in the transfer rules leads to a segregated population with extremely poor and extremely rich individuals after some time. Although our study is motivated by economic applications, we believe that this study is a first step towards a better understanding of many transfer phenomena occurring in the life sciences.</description>

      <title>Maximal $L_1$-regularity for the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equations with non-slip boundary conditions in the half space $ \mathbb{R}^N_{+}$. We prove the generation of a continous analytic semigroup associated with this compressible Stokes system with non-slip boundary conditions in the half space $\mathbb{R}^N_{+}$ and its $L_1$ in time maximal regularity. We choose the Besov space $ \mathcal{H}^s_{q,r} = B^{s+1}_{q,r}( \mathbb{R}^N_{+})\times B^s_{q,r}( \mathbb{R}^N_{+})^N$ as an underlying space, where $1 &lt; q &lt; \infty$, $1\leq r &lt; \infty$, and $-1+1/q &lt; s &lt; 1/q$. We prove the generation of a continuous analytic semigroup $\{T(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ on $\mathcal{H}^s_{q,r}$, and show that its generator admits maximal $L_1$ regularity. Our approach is to prove the existence of the resolvent in $\mathcal{H}^s_{q,1}$ and some new estimates for the resolvent by using $B^{s+1}_{q,1}( \mathbb{R}^N_{+}) \times B^{s\pm\sigma}_{q,1}( \mathbb{R}^N_{+})$ norms for some small $\sigma &gt; 0$ satisfying the condition $-1+1/q &lt; s-\sigma &lt; s &lt; s+\sigma &lt; 1/q$.</description>

      <title>The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle states a monotonic relationship between a possibly non-linear material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator. The Monotonicity Principle (MP) has attracted great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods.
  Together with the introduction of a MP and a related imaging method to treat the inverse obstacle problem in the presence of nonlinear anomalies, arose a set of fundamental questions regarding the performances of the method in the presence of noise.
  The main contribution of this work is focused on theoretical aspects and consists in proving that (i) the imaging method is stable and robust with respect to the noise, (ii) the reconstruction approaches monotonically to a well-defined limit, as the noise level approaches to zero, and that (iii) the limit contains the unknown set and is contained in the outer boundary of the unknown set.
  Results (i) and (ii) come directly from the Monotonicity Principle, while results (iii) requires to prove the so-called Converse of the Monotonicity Principle, a theoretical results of fundamental relevance to evaluate the ideal (noise-free) performances of the imaging method.
  The results are provided in a quite general setting for Calder\'on problem, and proved for three wide classes where the nonlinearity of the anomaly can be either bounded from infinity and zero, or bounded from zero only, or bounded by infinity only. These classes of constitutive relationships cover the wide majority of cases encountered in applications.
  To be concrete, the PDE considered in this study is the one that governs Electrical Resistance Tomography.</description>

      <title>Weak parabolic Harnack inequality and H\"older regularity for non-local Dirichlet forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give equivalent conditions for the weak parabolic Harnack inequality for general regular Dirichlet forms without killing part, in terms of local heat kernel estimates or growth lemmas. With a tail estimate on the jump measure, we obtain from these conditions the H\"older continuity of caloric and harmonic functions. Our results generalize the theory of Chen, Kumagai and Wang, in the sense that the upper jumping smoothness condition is canceled. We also derive the complete forms of Harnack inequalities from the globally non-negative versions, and obtain continuity of caloric functions with worse tails.</description>

      <title>Dynamics near the ground state for the Sobolev critical Fujita type heat equation in 6D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of solutions to $u_t=\Delta u+|u|^{p-1}u$ in the Sobolev critical case. Our main result is a classification of the dynamics near the ground states in the six dimensional case. It is shown that if the initial data $u_0\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^6)$ satisfies $\|u_0-{\sf Q}\|_{\dot H^1(\mathbb{R}^6)}\ll1$, then the solution falls into one of the following three scenarios: 1) It is globally defined and converge to one of the ground states as $t\to\infty$. 2)  It is globally defined and converge to $0$ in $\dot H^1(\mathbb{R}^6)$ as $t\to\infty$. 3) It exhibits finite time blowup with a type I rate. This paper extends the classification result in the case $n\geq7$, previously obtained by Collot-Merle-Rapha\"el, to the borderline case $n=6$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of a Schr\"odinger equation in dimension one with a nonlinear point interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an effective equation for the dynamics of many identical bosons in dimension one in the presence of a tiny impurity. The interaction between every pair of bosons is mediated by the impurity through a positive three-body potential. Assuming a simultaneous mean-field and short-range scaling with the short-range proceeding slower than the mean-field, and choosing an initial fully condensed state, we prove propagation of chaos and obtain an effective one-particle Schr\"odinger equation with a defocusing nonlinearity concentrated at a point. More precisely, we prove the convergence of one-particle density operators in the trace-class topology and estimate the fluctuations as superexponential. This is the first derivation of the so-called nonlinear delta model, widely investigated in the last decades, as a phenomenological model for several physical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We show the non-compactness of moduli space of solutions of the monopole equations for $3/2$-spinors on a closed 3-manifold is equivalent to the existence of `3/2-Fueter sections' that are solutions of an overdetermined non-linear elliptic differential equation. These are sections of a fiber bundle whose fiber is a special 4-dimensional submanifold of the hyperk\"ahler manifold of center-framed charged one $SU(2)$-instantons on $\mathbf{R}^4$. This fiber bundle does not inherit a hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new boundary condition for the weak inverse mean curvature flow, which gives canonical and non-trivial solutions in bounded domains. Roughly speaking, the boundary of the domain serves as an outer obstacle, and the evolving hypersurfaces are assumed to stick tangentially to the boundary upon contact. In smooth bounded domains, we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for weak solutions, and establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of the level sets up to the obstacle. The proof combines various techniques, including elliptic regularization, blow-up analysis, and certain parabolic estimates. As an analytic application, we address the well-posedness problem for the usual weak inverse mean curvature flow, showing that the initial value problem always admits a unique maximal (or innermost) weak solution.</description>

      <title>Parametric holomorphy of elliptic eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (parametric PDEs) with countably many parameters has been actively studied for the last few decades. In particular, it has been well known that a certain type of parametric holomorphy of the PDE solutions allows the application of deep neural networks without encountering the curse of dimensionality. This paper aims to propose a general framework for verifying the desired parametric holomorphy by utilizing the bounds on parametric derivatives. The framework is illustrated with examples of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems (EVPs), encompassing both linear and semilinear cases. As the results, it will be shown that the ground eigenpairs have the desired holomorphy. Furthermore, under the same conditions, the bounds for the mixed derivatives of the ground eigenpairs are derived. These bounds are well known to take a crucial role in the error analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</description>
