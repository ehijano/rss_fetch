      <title>Spatiotemporal Impact of Trade Policy Variables on Asian Manufacturing Hubs: Bayesian Global Vector Autoregression Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel spatiotemporal framework using diverse econometric approaches is proposed in this research to analyze relationships among eight economy-wide variables in varying market conditions. Employing Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Granger causality, we explore trade policy effects on emerging manufacturing hubs in China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam. A Bayesian Global Vector Autoregression (BGVAR) model also assesses interaction of cross unit and perform Unconditional and Conditional Forecasts. Utilizing time-series data from the Asian Development Bank, our study reveals multi-way cointegration and dynamic connectedness relationships among key economy-wide variables. This innovative framework enhances investment decisions and policymaking through a data-driven approach.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Inference Bands for Autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample autocorrelograms typically come with significance bands (non-rejection regions) for the null hypothesis of temporal independence. These bands have two shortcomings. First, they build on pointwise intervals and suffer from joint undercoverage (overrejection) under the null hypothesis. Second, if this null is clearly violated one would rather prefer to see confidence bands to quantify estimation uncertainty. We propose and discuss both simultaneous significance bands and simultaneous confidence bands for time series and series of regression residuals. They are as easy to construct as their pointwise counterparts and at the same time provide an intuitive and visual quantification of sampling uncertainty as well as valid statistical inference. For regression residuals, we show that for static regressions the asymptotic variances underlying the construction of the bands are as for observed time series and for dynamic regressions (with lagged endogenous regressors) we show how they need to be adjusted. We study theoretical properties of simultaneous significance bands and two types of simultaneous confidence bands (sup-t and Bonferroni) and analyse their finite-sample performance in a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate the use of the bands in an application to monthly US inflation and residuals from Phillips curve regressions.</description>

      <title>The Local Approach to Causal Inference under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03810v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new nonparametric modeling framework for causal inference when outcomes depend on how agents are linked in a social or economic network. Such network interference describes a large literature on treatment spillovers, social interactions, social learning, information diffusion, disease and financial contagion, social capital formation, and more. Our approach works by first characterizing how an agent is linked in the network using the configuration of other agents and connections nearby as measured by path distance. The impact of a policy or treatment assignment is then learned by pooling outcome data across similarly configured agents. We demonstrate the approach by deriving finite-sample bounds on the mean-squared error of a k-nearest-neighbor estimator for the average treatment response as well as proposing an asymptotically valid test for the hypothesis of policy irrelevance.</description>

      <title>Inference on Multiple Winners with Applications to Microcredit and Economic Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While policymakers and researchers are often concerned with conducting inference based on a data-dependent selection, a strictly larger class of inference problems arises when considering multiple data-dependent selections, such as when selecting on statistical significance or quantiles. Given this, we study the problem of conducting inference on multiple selections, which we dub the inference on multiple winners problem. In this setting, we encounter both selective and multiple testing problems, making existing approaches either not applicable or too conservative. Instead, we propose a novel, two-step approach to the inference on multiple winners problem, with the first step modeling the selection of winners, and the second step using this model to conduct inference only on the set of likely winners. Our two-step approach reduces over-coverage error by up to 96%. We apply our two-step approach to revisit the winner's curse in the creating moves to opportunity (CMTO) program, and to study external validity issues in the microcredit literature. In the CMTO application, we find that, after correcting for the inference on multiple winners problem, we fail to reject the possibility of null effects in the majority of census tracts selected by the CMTO program. In our microcredit application, we find that heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates remains largely unaffected even after our proposed inference corrections.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Causal Effects in a Nonlinear World: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applied macroeconomists frequently use impulse response estimators motivated by linear models. We study whether the estimands of such procedures have a causal interpretation when the true data generating process is in fact nonlinear. We show that vector autoregressions and linear local projections onto observed shocks or proxies identify weighted averages of causal effects regardless of the extent of nonlinearities. By contrast, identification approaches that exploit heteroskedasticity or non-Gaussianity of latent shocks are highly sensitive to departures from linearity. Our analysis is based on new results on the identification of marginal treatment effects through weighted regressions, which may also be of interest to researchers outside macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Counting Defiers in Health Care: A Design-Based Model of an Experiment Can Reveal Evidence Against Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a design-based model of an experiment with a binary intervention and outcome can reveal empirical evidence against a ``monotonicity'' assumption that the intervention affects all subjects in weakly the same direction. A canonical sampling-based model cannot, but we show that other sampling-based models can. Using statistical decision theory, we propose a maximum likelihood decision rule that does not assume monotonicity and provide conditions for its optimality. Under these conditions, we calculate the exact performance of our rule in small samples and show that the gains relative to a rule that assumes monotonicity grow with the sample size. In a real experiment in health care, we use visualizations of potential outcomes to illustrate evidence against monotonicity, which we quantify with a likelihood ratio. Despite a large and statistically significant average effect, our rule reveals positive counts of compilers affected in one direction and defiers affected in the other.</description>

      <title>Has the Paris Agreement Shaped Emission Trends? A Panel VECM Analysis of Energy, Growth, and CO$_2$ in 106 Middle-Income Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rising CO$_2$ emissions remain a critical global challenge, particularly in middle-income countries where economic growth drives environmental degradation. This study examines the long-run and short-run relationships between CO$_2$ emissions, energy use, GDP per capita, and population across 106 middle-income countries from 1980 to 2023. Using a Panel Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), we assess the impact of the Paris Agreement (2015) on emissions while conducting cointegration tests to confirm long-run equilibrium relationships. The findings reveal a strong long-run relationship among the variables, with energy use as the dominant driver of emissions, while GDP per capita has a moderate impact. However, the Paris Agreement has not significantly altered emissions trends in middle-income economies. Granger causality tests indicate that energy use strongly causes emissions, but GDP per capita and population do not exhibit significant short-run causal effects. Variance decomposition confirms that energy shocks have the most persistent effects, and impulse response functions (IRFs) show emissions trajectories are primarily shaped by economic activity rather than climate agreements. Robustness checks, including autocorrelation tests, polynomial root stability, and Yamagata-Pesaran slope homogeneity tests, validate model consistency. These results suggest that while global agreements set emissions reduction goals, their effectiveness remains limited without stronger national climate policies, sectoral energy reforms, and financial incentives for clean energy adoption to ensure sustainable economic growth.</description>
