      <title>Quasi-canonical AFL and Arithmetic Transfer conjectures at parahoric levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we formulate several arithmetic transfer conjectures, which are variants of the arithmetic fundamental lemma conjecture in the presence of ramification. The ramification comes from the choice of non-hyperspecial parahoric level structure. We prove a graph version of these arithmetic transfer conjectures, by relating it to the quasi-canonical arithmetic fundamental lemma, which we also establish. We relate some of the arithmetic transfer conjectures to the arithmetic fundamental lemma conjecture for the whole Hecke algebra in our recent paper arXiv:2305.14465. As a consequence, we prove these conjectures in some simple cases. In the second part of the paper, we elucidate the structure of an integral model of a certain member of the almost selfdual Rapoport-Zink tower, thereby proving conjectures of Kudla and the second author. This result allows us verify the hypotheses of the graph version of the arithmetic transfer conjectures in a particular case.</description>

      <title>Marton's Conjecture in abelian groups with bounded torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Freiman--Ruzsa-type theorem with polynomial bounds in arbitrary abelian groups with bounded torsion, thereby proving (in full generality) a conjecture of Marton. Specifically, let $G$ be an abelian group of torsion $m$ (meaning $mg=0$ for all $g \in G$) and suppose that $A$ is a non-empty subset of $G$ with $|A+A| \leq K|A|$. Then $A$ can be covered by at most $(2K)^{O(m^3)}$ translates of a subgroup of $H \leq G$ of cardinality at most $|A|$. The argument is a variant of that used in the case $G = \mathbf{F}_2^n$ in a recent paper of the authors.</description>

      <title>The Least Prime in Arithmetic an Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his 1979 paper Samuel Wagstaff studied the problem of bounding the first prime in an arithmetic progression. In this paper we update a number of his computations using advances in hardware. Based on this we refine his conjecture on Primes in Arithmetic Progression and provide further numerical evidence in support of it. For instance we conjecture that for $n&gt;3$ we have a bound of $3\phi(n)\log(n)\log(\phi(n))$ and verified this bound to $10^8$.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Spivey's recurrence relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2008, Spivey found a recurrence relation for the Bell numbers. We consider the probabilistic r-Bell polynomials associated with which are a probabilistic extension of the r-Bell polynomials. Here Y is a random variable whose moment generating function exists in some neighborhood of the origin . The aim of this paper is to generalize the relation for the Bell numbers to that for the probabilistic r-Bell polynomials associated with Y.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of an earlier one, and completes a classification of the configurations of points in a plane lattice that determine angles that are rational multiples of ${\pi}$.

      <title>Explainable Ramanujan-type Congruences on Square-Classes of Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While examples of Ramanujan-type congruences are amply available via their relation to Hecke operators, it remains unclear which of them should be considered of combinatorial origin and which of them are mere artifacts of the connection with modular forms. Ranks and generalized ranks have been proposed as a tool to discern this question. We formalize this idea as "explainable Ramanujan-type congruences" with reference to Jacobi forms with singularities at torsion points, and then associated with them subspaces in a specific complex representation of the modular group. The resulting representation theoretic perspective allows us to prove that explainable Ramanujan-type congruences occur on square-classes $M \mathbb{Z} + u^2 \beta$ of arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Universally defining subrings in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that all rings of $S$-integers are universally definable in function fields in one variable over certain ground fields including global and non-archimedean local fields. That is, we show that the complement of such a ring of $S$-integers is always a diophantine set. As a technical tool, we use a reciprocity exact sequence for quadratic Witt groups in function fields over almost arbitrary base fields (of any characteristic), which is new and of potentially independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p\leq 23$ be a prime and $a_p(n)$ count the number of partitions of $n$ using two colors where one of the colors only has parts divisible by $p$. Using a result of Sussman, we derive the exact formula for $a_p(n)$ and obtain an asymptotic formula for $\log a_p(n)$. Our results partially extend the work of Mauth, who proved the asymptotic formula for $\log a_2(n)$ conjectured by Banerjee et al.</description>

      <title>A dynamical version of Silverman-Tate's height inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.09774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper "Uniformity of Mordell-Lang" by Vesselin Dimitrov, Philipp Habegger and Ziyang Gao (arXiv:2001.10276), they use Silverman-Tate's Height Inequality and they give a proof of the same which makes use of Cartier divisors and hence drops the flatness assumption of structure morphisms of compactified abelian schemes. However, their proof makes use of Hironaka's theorem on resolution of singularities which is unknown for fields of positive characteristic. We try to slightly modify their ideas, use blow-ups in place of Hironaka's theorem to make the proof effective for any fields with product formula where heights can be defined and any normal quasi-projective variety as a base. We work in the more general set up of dynamical systems. As an application we prove certain variant of Silverman's Specialization Theorem with restricted hypotheses in higher dimensional bases.</description>

      <title>On Wirsing's problem in small exact degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a variant of Wirsing's problem on approximation to a real number by real algebraic numbers of degree exactly $n$. This has been studied by Bugeaud and Teulie. We improve their bounds for degrees up to $n=7$. Moreover, we obtain results regarding small values of polynomials and approximation to a real number by algebraic integers in small prescribed degree. The main ingredient are irreducibility criteria for integral linear combinations of coprime integer polynomials. Moreover, for cubic polynomials these criteria improve results of Gy\H{o}ry on a problem of Szegedy.</description>

      <title>Uniform Integrality of critical values of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function for ${\rm GL}_{n}\times {\rm GL}_{n-1}$</title>

Abstract: After introducing the notion of uniform integrality of critical values of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions for $\mathrm{GL}_{n}\times \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}$, we study it when the base field is totally imaginary. For this purpose, we adopt specific models of highest weight representations of the general linear groups, construct the Eichler-Shimura classes for $\mathrm{GL}_{n}$ and $\mathrm{GL}_{n-1}$ in an explicit manner, and then evaluate the cohomological cup product of them, by making the best use of Gel'fand-Tsetlin basis.</description>

      <title>On the average congruence class bias for cyclicity and divisibility of the groups of $\mathbb{F}_p$-points of elliptic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2009, W. D. Banks and I. E. Shparlinski studied the average densities of primes $p \leq x$ for which the reductions of elliptic curves of small height modulo $p$ satisfy certain arithmetic properties, namely cyclicity and divisibility of the number of points by a fixed integer $m$. In this paper, we refine their results, restricting the primes $p$ under consideration to lie in an arithmetic progression $k \bmod{n}$. Furthermore, for a fixed modulus $n$, we investigate statistical biases among the different congruence classes $k \bmod{n}$ of primes satisfying the aforementioned properties.</description>

      <title>Five families of rapidly convergent evaluations of zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work derives 5 methods to evaluate families of odd zeta values by combining a power of $\pi$ with Lambert series whose ratios of successive terms tend to $e^{-\pi\sqrt{a}}$ with integers $a\ge7$, outperforming Ramanujan's results with merit $a=4$. Families with $a=7$ and $a=8$ evaluate $\zeta(2n+1)$. Families with $a=9$ and $a=16$ evaluate $\zeta(4n+1)$ with faster convergence. A fifth family with $a=12$ evaluates $\zeta(6n+1)$ and gives the fastest convergence for $\zeta(6n+7)$. Members of three of the families were discovered empirically by Simon Plouffe. An intensive new search strongly suggests that there are no more than 5 families with integers $a\ge7$. There are at least 20 families that involve Lambert series with rational $a&gt;4$. Quasi-modular transformations of Lambert series resolve rational sequences that were discovered empirically. Expansions of Lambert series in polylogarithms, familiar from quantum field theory, provide proofs of all known evaluations with rational merit $a&gt;4$.</description>

Abstract: We work toward the arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity (AQUE) conjecture for sequences of Hecke--Maass forms on hyperbolic $4$-manifolds. We show that limits of such forms can only scar on totally geodesic $3$-submanifolds, and in fact that all ergodic components of the microlocal lift other than the uniform measure arise from the uniform measures on these submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Counting numbers that are divisible by the product of their digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $b \geq 3$ be a positive integer. A natural number is said to be a base-$b$ Zuckerman number if it is divisible by the product of its base-$b$ digits. Let $\mathcal{Z}_b(x)$ be the set of base-$b$ Zuckerman numbers that do not exceed $x$, and assume that $x \to +\infty$. First, we prove an upper bound of the form $|\mathcal{Z}_b(x)| &lt; x^{z_b^{+} + o(1)}$, where $z_b^{+} \in (0,1)$ is an effectively computable constant. In particular, we have that $z_{10}^+ = 0.665{\scriptstyle\ldots}$, which improves upon the previous upper bound $|\mathcal{Z}_{10}(x)| &lt; x^{0.717}$ due to Sanna. Moreover, we prove that $|\mathcal{Z}_{10}(x)| &gt; x^{0.204}$, which improves upon the previous lower bound $|\mathcal{Z}_{10}(x)| &gt; x^{0.122}$, due to De Koninck and Luca. Second, we provide a heuristic suggesting that $|\mathcal{Z}_b(x)| = x^{z_b + o(1)}$, where $z_b \in (0,1)$ is an effectively computable constant. In particular, we have that $z_{10} = 0.419{\scriptstyle\ldots}$. Third, we provide algorithms to count, respectively enumerate, the elements of $\mathcal{Z}_b(x)$, and we determine their complexities. Implementing one of such counting algorithms, we computed $|\mathcal{Z}_b(x)|$ for $b=3,\dots,12$ and large values of $x$ (depending on $b$), and we showed that the results are consistent with our heuristic.</description>

      <title>A Complete Congruence System for the Erdos-Straus Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we attack the Erdos-Straus conjecture by means of the structure of its solutions, extending and improving the results of a previous paper. Using previous results and supported by the works of Elsholtz and Tao and Monks and Velingker we define a system of congruences for which there are always solutions to the Erdos-Straus conjecture and which we conjecture to include all prime numbers. For this purpose, and always taking into account a result due to Mordell that limits the congruences admitting polynomial identities to those that are not quadratic residues, we will adopt a transversal approach and classify the solutions by their form and not by those congruences that produce them. Thus we define two new types of solutions, which we call Type A and B, and relate them to the already known Type II solutions and study their properties. Finally we conjecture that every prime number has at least one solution of Type A or B and we associate a congruence and a general polynomial to each Type of solution.</description>

Abstract: We prove asymptotics for real moments of the logarithmic derivative of characteristic polynomials evaluated at $1-\frac{a}{N}$ in unitary, even orthogonal, and symplectic ensembles, where $a&gt;0$ and $a=o(1)$ as the size $N$ of the matrix goes to infinity. Previously, such asymptotics were known only for integer moments (in the unitary ensemble by the work of Bailey, Bettin, Blower, Conrey, Prokhorov, Rubinstein and Snaith, and in orthogonal and symplectic ensembles by the work of Alvarez and Snaith), except that in the odd orthogonal ensemble real moments asymptotics were obtained by Alvarez, Bousseyroux and Snaith. Our proof is new and does not make use of the aforementioned integer moments results, and is different from the method in the work of Alvarez et al for the odd orthogonal ensemble.</description>

Abstract: The Matrix Waring problem is if we can write every matrix as a sum of $k$-th powers. Here, we look at the same problem for triangular matrix algebra $T_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ consisting of upper triangular matrices over a finite field. We prove that for all integers $k, n \geq 1$, there exists a constant $\mathcal C(k, n)$, such that for all $q&gt; \mathcal C(k,n)$, every matrix in $T_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is a sum of three $k$-th powers. Moreover, if $-1$ is $k$-th power in $\mathbb{F}_q$, then for all $q&gt;\mathcal C(k,n)$, every matrix in $T_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is a sum of two $k$-th powers. We make use of Lang-Weil estimates about the number of solutions of equations over finite fields to achieve the desired results.</description>
