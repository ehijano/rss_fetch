      <title>Dispersive blow-up for a coupled Schr\"odinger-fifth order KdV system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish a dispersive blow-up result for the initial value problem (IVP) for the coupled Schr\"odinger-fifth order Korteweg-de Vries system \begin{align*} \left. \begin{array}{rl} i u_t+\partial_x^2 u &amp;\hspace{-2mm}=\alpha uv + \gamma |u|^2 u, \quad x\in\mathbb R,\quad t\in\mathbb R,\\ \partial_t v + \partial_x^5 v + \partial_x v^2&amp;\hspace{-2mm}=\epsilon \partial_x |u|^2, \quad x\in\mathbb R,\quad t\in\mathbb R,\\ u(x,0)&amp;\hspace{-2mm}= u_0(x), \quad v(x,0)=v_0(x). \end{array} \right\} \end{align*} To achieve this, we prove a local well-posedness result in Bourgain spaces of the type $X^{s+\beta,b}\times Y^{s,b}$, along with a regularity property for the nonlinear part of the IVP solutions. This property enables the construction of initial data that leads to the dispersive blow-up phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Boundary null controllability of a class of 2-d degenerate parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the boundary null controllability of some degenerate parabolic equations posed on a square domain, presenting the first study of boundary controllability for such equations in multidimensional settings. The proof combines two classical techniques: the method of moments and the Lebeau-Robbiano strategy. A key novelty of this work lies in the analysis of boundary control localized on a subset of the boundary where the degeneracy occurs. Furthermore, we establish the Kalman rank condition as a full characterization of boundary controllability for coupled degenerate systems. The results are extended to $N$-dimensional domains, and potential extensions and open problems are discussed to motivate further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Appearance of Strauss-type exponent in semilinear wave equations with time-dependent speed of propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, blowup phenomenon for the semilinear wave equation with time-dependent speed of propagation and scattering damping is considered under the smallness of initial data. Our result contains small data blowup for sub-Strauss exponent for the simplest semilinear wave equation and also the one for semilinear generalized Tricomi equation. Key ingredient is so-called test function method (developed in Ikeda--Sobajima--Wakasa [10]) with a certain conservative quantity via a special solution with the Liouville--Green (or WKB) approximation.</description>

      <title>Existence results of Toda systems with a singularity and sign-changing weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence result of the following Singular Toda system on a compact Riemann surface $(\Sigma, g)$ without boundary
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta_gu_1=2\rho_1\Big({\frac{h_1e^{u_1}}{\int_{\Sigma}h_1e^{u_1}dV_g}}-1\Big)-\rho_2\Big({\frac{h_2e^{u_2}}{\int_{\Sigma}h_2e^{u_2}dV_g}}-1\Big)-4\pi\alpha_1(\delta_0-1),

  -\Delta_gu_2=2\rho_2\big({\frac{h_2e^{u_2}}{\int_{\Sigma}h_2e^{u_2}dV_g}}-1\big)-\rho_1\big({\frac{h_1e^{u_1}}{\int_{\Sigma}h_1e^{u_1}dV_g}}-1\big)-4\pi\alpha_2(\delta_0-1),
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  where $h_1,\,h_2$ are sign-changing smooth functions,\ $\rho_1=\overline{\rho}_1:=4\pi(1+\overline{\alpha}_1),\,0&lt;\rho_2&lt;4\pi(1+\overline{\alpha}_2),\,\overline{\alpha}_i=\min\{0,\alpha_i\},\,\alpha_i&gt;-1,\,i=1,2$.
  \par
  By relying on the idea in\,\cite{DJLW},\,\cite{JLW},\,\cite{Zhu-a-s} and the framework of blow-up analysis based on the Pohozaev identity, we proved the non-exist result and also establish the existence theorem under some sufficient condition. Our results extend zhu's conclusions\,\cite{Zhu-a-s} from scalar Liouville equation to the system and also generalize Jost-Wang's result from regular Toda system with positive functions to the singular Toda system involving sign-changing weight functions.</description>

      <title>Blow-up results for the semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with forcing and gradient terms: the critical cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of critical cases of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with source and gradient terms, subsequently providing answers to some open questions posed by Alotaibi et al in [Z. Angew. Math. Phys., 73 (2022), 1-17]. The main results state that in critical cases, the problem under consideration does not have any global-in-time weak solutions. The proof approach is based on modified method of test functions specifically adapted to the nature of considered problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an integral identity for a class $p$-Laplace equation, and then classify all positive finite energy cylindrically symmetric solutions of the equation (\ref{1.2}) for $3\leq k\leq n-1,$ with the help of some a prior estimates. Combining this with the result of Secchi-Smets-Willem{\cite{SSW03}}, as a consequence, we obtain the best constant and extremal functions for the related Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for beam equations with potentials on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the time decay estimates for the following beam equation with a potential on the line: $$
  \partial_t^2 u + \left( \Delta^2 + m^2 + V(x) \right) u = 0, \ \ u(0, x) = f(x),\quad \partial_t u(0, x) = g(x), $$ where $V$ is a real-valued decaying potential on $\mathbb{R}$, and $m \in \mathbb{R}$.
  Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ and $P_{ac}(H)$ denote the projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum of $H$. Then for $m = 0$, we establish the following decay estimates of the solution operators:
  $$
  \left\|\cos (t \sqrt{H}) P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{L^1 \rightarrow L^{\infty}} +
  \left\|\frac{\sin (t \sqrt{H})}{t \sqrt{H}} P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{L^1 \rightarrow L^{\infty}} \lesssim |t|^{-\frac{1}{2}}.
  $$ But for $m \neq 0$, the solutions have different time decay estimates from the case where $m=0$. Specifically, the $L^1$-$L^\infty$ estimates of $\cos (t \sqrt{H + m^2})$ and $\frac{\sin (t \sqrt{H + m^2})}{\sqrt{H + m^2}}$ are bounded by $O(|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}})$ in the low-energy part and $O(|t|^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ in the high-energy part.
  It is noteworthy that all these results remain consistent with the free cases (i.e., $V = 0$) whatever zero is a regular point or a resonance of $H$. As consequences, we establish the corresponding Strichartz estimates, which are fundamental to study nonlinear problems of beam equations.</description>

      <title>Optimal higher derivative estimates for Stokes equations with closely spaced rigid inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the interaction between two closely spaced rigid inclusions suspended in a Stokes flow. It is well known that the stress significantly amplifies in the narrow region between the inclusions as the distance between them approaches zero. To gain deeper insight into these interactions, we derive high-order derivative estimates for the Stokes equation in the presence of two rigid inclusions in two dimensions. Our approach resonates with the method used to handle the incompressibility constraint in the standard convex integration scheme. Under certain symmetric assumptions on the domain, these estimates are shown to be optimal. As a result, we establish the precise blow-up rates of the Cauchy stress and its higher-order derivatives in the narrow region.</description>

      <title>Optimal $L^2$-blowup estimates of the Fractional Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the behavior in time of the solution to the Cauchy problem for a fractional wave equation with a weighted $L^1$ initial data. Initially, we establish the global existence of the solution using Fourier methods and provide upper bounds for the $L^2$ norm and the $H^s$ norm of the solution for any dimension $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $s\in (0,1)$. However, when $n=1$ and $s \in [\frac{1}{2},1)$, %we have to assume that the initial velocity satisfies we have to impose a stronger assumption $\int_{\mathbb{R}}u_1(x)dx=0$. To remove this stronger assumption, we further use the Fourier splitting method, which yields the optimal blow-up rate for the $L^2$ norm of the solutions. Specifically, when $n=1$, the optimal blow-up rate is $t^{1-\frac{1}{2s}}$ for $s \in (\frac{1}{2},1)$ and $\sqrt{\log t}$ for $s = \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Transition layers to chemotaxis-consumption models with volume-filling effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the dynamical behaviors of solutions to a parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis-consumption model with a volume-filling effect on a bounded interval, where the physical no-flux boundary condition for the bacteria and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition for the oxygen are prescribed. By taking a continuity argument, we first show that the model admits a unique nonconstant steady state. Then we use Helly's compactness theorem to show that the asymptotic profile of steady state is a transition layer as the chemotactic coefficient goes to infinity. Finally, based on the energy method along with a cancellation structure of the model, we show that the steady state is nonlinearly stable under appropriate perturbations. Moreover, we do not need any assumption on the parameters in showing the stability of steady state.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves to a logarithmic chemotaxis model with fast diffusion and singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a chemotaxis model with logarithmic sensitivity and fast diffusion, which possesses strong singularities for the sensitivity at zero-concentration of chemical signal, and for the diffusion at zero-population of cells, respectively. The main purpose is to show the existence of traveling waves connecting the singular zero-end-state, and particularly, to show the asymptotic stability of these traveling waves. The challenge of the problem is the interaction of two kinds of singularities involved in the model: one is the logarithmic singularity of the sensitivity; and the other is the power-law singularity of the diffusivity. To overcome the singularities for the wave stability, some new techniques of weighted energy method are introduced artfully. Numerical simulations are also carried out, which further confirm our theoretical stability results, in particular, the numerical results indicate that the effect of fast diffusion to the structure of traveling waves is essential, which causes the traveling waves much steeper like shock waves. This new phenomenon is a first observation.</description>

      <title>On the analyticity of the flow map for the AHT equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AHT equation is a non linear and non local vectorial transport equation which was introduced in 2003 by Angenent, Haker and Tannenbaum in optimal transport theory. For this equation, classical solutions are known to exist at least locally in time, and a flow map can thus be uniquely associated with these solutions. In this paper we consider the case where the equation is set in a bounded domain with an analytic boundary and we prove that the flow map is analytic with respect to time.</description>

      <title>A stability result for parabolic measures of operators with singular drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the operator \[ \partial_t - \text{div} A \nabla + B \cdot \nabla \] in parabolic upper-half-space, where $A$ is an elliptic matrix satisfying an oscillation condition and $B$ is a singular drift with a Carleson control. Our main result establishes quantitative $A_{\infty}$-estimates for the parabolic measure in terms of oscillation of $A$ and smallness of $B$. The proof relies on new estimates for parabolic Green functions that quantify their deviations from linear functions of the normal variable and on a novel, quantitative Carleson measure criterion for anisotropic $A_{\infty}$-weights.</description>

Abstract: We establish partial regularity results for minimizers of a class of functionals depending on differential expressions based on elliptic operators. Specifically, we focus on functionals of Orlicz growth with a natural strong quasiconvexity property. In doing so, we consider both $\Delta_{2}\cap\nabla_{2}$-Orlicz growth scenarios and, as a limiting case, $L \log L$-growth. Inspired by Conti &amp; Gmeineder (J Calc Var, 61:215, 2022), the proofs of our main results are accomplished by reduction to the case of full gradient partial regularity results.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous incompressible Euler with codimension $1$ singular structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler system. We establish a Duchon--Robert type approximation theorem for the distribution describing the local energy flux of bounded solutions. The velocity field is assumed to have bounded variation or bounded deformation with respect to the spatial variable. The density satisfies no-vacuum condition and has $BV$ regularity in space, allowing for a system made by two immiscible fluids separated by a Lipschitz hypersurface. By means of a careful analysis of the traces along hypersufaces of bounded vector fields with measure divergence, we show that the dissipation does not give mass to hypersurfaces of codimension one, even if the velocity field, the density and the pressure have jumps. This feature is specific of incompressible models. As a consequence, we show that the dissipation measure vanishes if it is concentrated on a countably rectifiable set of space-time codimension one, even if this is dense. For instance, in the simplest case of a system made by two incompressible immiscible fluids with $BV$ velocity, the dissipation measure vanishes as soon as the interface between the two fluids has (space-time) finite perimeter.</description>

      <title>On least energy solutions to a pure Neumann Lane-Emden system: convergence, symmetry breaking, and multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following Lane-Emden system with Neumann boundary conditions \[ -\Delta u= |v|^{q-1}v \text{ in } \Omega,\qquad -\Delta v= |u|^{p-1}u \text{ in } \Omega,\qquad \partial_\nu u=\partial_\nu v=0 \text{ on } \partial \Omega, \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N \ge 1$. We study the multiplicity of solutions and the convergence of least energy (nodal) solutions (l.e.s.) as the exponents $p, q &gt; 0$ vary in the subcritical regime $1/(p+1) + 1/(q+1) &gt; (N-2)/N$, or in the critical case $1/(p+1) + 1/(q+1) =(N-2)/N$ with some additional assumptions. We consider, for the first time in this setting, the cases where one or two exponents tend to zero, proving that l.e.s. converge to a problem with a sign nonlinearity. Our approach is based on an alternative characterization of least energy levels in terms of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem \[ \Delta (|\Delta u|^{\frac 1 q -1} \Delta u) = \lambda |u|^{p-1} u, \quad \partial_\nu u=\partial_\nu(|\Delta u|^{\frac 1 q -1} \Delta u)=0 \text{ on } \partial \Omega. \] As an application, we show a symmetry breaking phenomenon for l.e.s. of a bilaplacian equation with sign nonlinearity and for other equations with nonlinear higher-order operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a dissipative measure-valued solution to the Euler alignment system. This approach incorporates a modified total energy balance, utilizing a binary tensor Young measure. The central finding is a weak (measure-valued)--strong uniqueness principle: if both a dissipative measure-valued solution and a classical smooth solution originate from the same initial data, they will be identical as long as the classical solution exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with function spaces in various branches of mathematical analysis introduces optimality problems, where the question of choosing a function space both accessible and expressive becomes a nontrivial exercise. A good middle ground is provided by Orlicz spaces, parameterized by a single Young function and thus accessible, yet expansive. In this work, we study optimality problems on Sobolev embeddings in Mazya classes of Euclidean domains which are defined through their isoperimetric behavior. In particular, we prove the nonexistence of optimal Orlicz spaces in certain Orlicz Sobolev embeddings in a limiting, or critical, state whose pivotal special case is the celebrated embedding of Brezis and Wainger for John domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive new sharp weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel and Minkowski inequalities for smooth, closed hypersurfaces under various convexity assumptions in Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces. These inequalities extend classical results by incorporating weights given by convex, non-decreasing positive functions, which are otherwise arbitrary. Our approach gives rise to a broad family of geometric inequalities, as each convex, non-decreasing function yields a corresponding inequality, providing considerable flexibility.</description>

      <title>Combined DG-CG finite element method for the Westervelt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a space--time finite element method for Westervelt's quasilinear model of ultrasound waves in second-order formulation. The method combines conforming finite element spatial discretizations with a discontinuous-continuous Galerkin time stepping. Its analysis is challenged by the fact that standard Galerkin testing approaches for wave problems do not allow for bounding the discrete energy at all times. By means of redesigned energy arguments for a linearized problem combined with Banach's fixed-point argument, we show the well-posedness of the scheme, a priori error estimates, and robustness with respect to the strong damping parameter $\delta$. Moreover, the scheme preserves the asymptotic preserving property of the continuous problem; more precisely, we prove that the discrete solutions corresponding to $\delta&gt;0$ converge, in the singular vanishing dissipation limit, to the solution of the discrete inviscid problem. We use several numerical experiments in $(2 + 1)$-dimensions to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Towards kinetic equations of open systems of active soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chapter presents some new approaches to describing the collective behavior of complex systems of mathematical biology based on the evolution equations of observables such as open systems. This representation of kinetic evolution has looked to be the most direct and mathematically fully consistent formulation modeling the collective behavior of biological systems since the traditionally used concept of the state in kinetic theory is more subtle and is an implicit characteristic of the populations of living creatures. One of the advantages of the developed approach is the opportunity to construct kinetic equations for open complex systems in scaling approximations, involving initial correlations, in particular, that can characterize the condensed states of active soft matter. An approach is also related to the challenge of a rigorous derivation of the non-Markovian kinetic equations from underlying many-entity dynamics, which makes it possible to describe the memory effects of the collective behavior of living creatures.</description>

      <title>Finite-PINN: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture for Solving Solid Mechanics Problems with General Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PINN models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing fluid PDE problems, and their potential in solid mechanics is beginning to emerge. This study identifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid mechanics problems. These challenges become evident when comparing the limitations of PINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used in solid mechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a) PINN models generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with the finite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution space utilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the complex geometries often present in solid structures.
  This work proposes a PINN architecture used for general solid mechanics problems, termed the Finite-PINN model. The proposed model aims to effectively address these two challenges while preserving as much of the original implementation of PINN as possible. The unique architecture of the Finite-PINN model addresses these challenges by separating the approximation of stress and displacement fields, and by transforming the solution space from the traditional Euclidean space to a Euclidean-topological joint space. Several case studies presented in this paper demonstrate that the Finite-PINN model provides satisfactory results for a variety of problem types, including both forward and inverse problems, in both 2D and 3D contexts. The developed Finite-PINN model offers a promising tool for addressing general solid mechanics problems, particularly those not yet well-explored in current research.</description>

      <title>Discretely self-similar exterior-naked singularities for the Einstein-scalar field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of constructing naked singularities in general relativity can be naturally divided into two parts: (i) the construction of the region exterior to the past light cone of the singularity, extending all the way to (an incomplete) future null infinity and yielding the nakedness property (what we will call exterior-naked singularity regions); (ii) attaching an interior fill-in that ensures that the singularity arises from regular initial data. This problem has been resolved for the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system by Christodoulou, but his construction, based on a continuously self-similar ansatz, requires that both the exterior and the interior regions are mildly irregular on the past cone of the singularity. On the other hand, numerical works suggest that there exist naked singularity spacetimes with discrete self-similarity arising from smooth initial data. In this paper, we revisit part (i) of the problem and we construct exterior-naked singularity regions with discretely self-similar profiles which are smooth on the past cone of the singularity. We show that the scalar field remains uniformly bounded, but the singularity is characterized by the infinite oscillations of the scalar field and the mass aspect ratio. (Our examples require however that the mass aspect ratio is uniformly small, and thus the solutions are distinct from the exterior regions of the numerical examples.) It remains an open problem to smoothly attach interior fill-ins as in (ii) to our solutions, which would yield a new construction of naked singularity spacetimes, now arising from smooth initial data.</description>

Abstract: We consider the ill-posedness issue for the cubic nonlinear heat equation and prove norm inflation with infinite loss of regularity in the H\"older-Besov space $\mathcal C^s = B^{s}_{\infty, \infty}$ for $ s \le -\frac 23$. In particular, our result includes the subcritical range $-1&lt; s \le -\frac 23$, which is above the scaling critical regularity $s = -1$ with respect to the H\"older-Besov scale. In view of the well-posedness result in $\mathcal C^s$, $s &gt; -\frac 23$, our ill-posedness result is sharp.</description>

      <title>On the deep-water and shallow-water limits of the intermediate long wave equation from a statistical viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study convergence problems for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), with the depth parameter $\delta &gt; 0$, in the deep-water limit ($\delta \to \infty$) and the shallow-water limit ($\delta \to 0$) from a statistical point of view. In particular, we establish convergence of invariant Gibbs dynamics for ILW in both the deep-water and shallow-water limits. For this purpose, we first construct the Gibbs measures for ILW, $0 &lt; \delta &lt; \infty$. As they are supported on distributions, a renormalization is required. With the Wick renormalization, we carry out the construction of the Gibbs measures for ILW. We then prove that the Gibbs measures for ILW converge in total variation to that for the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit. In the shallow-water regime, after applying a scaling transformation, we prove that, as $\delta \to 0$, the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW converge weakly to that for the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). We point out that this second result is of particular interest since the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW and KdV are mutually singular (whereas the Gibbs measures for ILW and BO are equivalent).
  We also discuss convergence of the associated dynamical problem.
  Lastly, we point out that our results also apply to the generalized ILW equation in the defocusing case, converging to the generalized BO in the deep-water limit and to the generalized KdV in the shallow-water limit. In the non-defocusing case, however, our results can not be extended to a nonlinearity with a higher power due to the non-normalizability of the corresponding Gibbs measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. By establishing coming down from infinity for the associated stochastic nonlinear heat equation (SNLH) on the plane, we first construct a $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane as a limit of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measures on large tori. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane thus constructed, namely, we study the defocusing stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation forced by an additive space-time white noise (= the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model) on the plane. In particular, by taking a limit of the invariant Gibbs dynamics on large tori constructed by the first two authors with Gubinelli and Koch (2021), we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. Our main strategy is to develop further the ideas from a recent work on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model on the three-dimensional torus by the first two authors and Okamoto (2021), and to study convergence of the so-called enhanced Gibbs measures, for which coming down from infinity for the associated SNLH with positive regularity plays a crucial role. By combining wave and heat analysis together with ideas from optimal transport theory, we then conclude global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane and invariance of the associated Gibbs measure. As a byproduct of our argument, we also obtain invariance of the limiting $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane under the dynamics of the parabolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the action ground states of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with and without rotation. Our primary focus is on characterizing the relationship between the action ground states and the energy ground states. Theoretically, we prove a complete equivalence of the two in the non-rotating case and a conditional equivalence in the rotating case. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments. Notably, in the rotating case, we provide numerical examples of non-equivalence showing that non-equivalence typically occurs at the transition points where the number of vortices in the action ground state is increasing. Additionally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the action ground states and the associated physical quantities in certain limiting parameter regimes, with numerical results validating and complementing our analysis. Furthermore, we explore the formation and change of the vortex pattern in the action ground states numerically.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of mass supercritical Schrodinger-Poisson equation with potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of normalized solutions $(\lambda,u)\subset (0,\infty)\times H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ to the following Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equation $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta u+V(x)u+\lambda u+(|x|^{-1}\ast u^2)u=|u|^{p-2}u&amp;\text{in}\,\mathbb{R}^{3},\\ u&gt;0,\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}u^2dx=a^2, \end{cases} $$ where $a&gt;0$ is fixed, $p\in(\frac{10}{3},6)$ is a given exponent and the potential $V$ satisfies some suitable conditions. Since the $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm of $u$ is fixed, $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. For $V(x)\geq0$, our solutions are obtained by using a mountain-pass argument on bounded domains and a limit process introduced by Bartsch et al. For $V(x)\leq0$, we directly construct an entire mountain-pass solution with positive energy.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the Dirichlet problem for a non-divergence form elliptic operator $L$ in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under certain conditions on the coefficients of $L$, we first establish the existence of a unique Green's function in a ball and derive two-sided pointwise estimates for it. Utilizing these results, we demonstrate the equivalence of regular points for $L$ and those for the Laplace operator, characterized via the Wiener test. This equivalence facilitates the unique solvability of the Dirichlet problem with continuous boundary data in regular domains. Furthermore, we construct the Green's function for $L$ in regular domains and establish pointwise bounds for it. This advancement is significant, as it extends the scope of existing estimates to domains beyond $C^{1,1}$, contributing to our understanding of elliptic operators in non-divergence form.</description>

      <title>The virtual element method for the three dimensional inductionless magnetohydrodynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel first-order and a novel second-order fully discrete virtual element schemes based on the scalar auxiliary variable method for the three dimensional inductionless magnetohydrodynamics problem. The backward Eular formula and the backward differential formula are used for the time discretization and two types conservation virtual element formulations are employed for spatial discretization. The main advantages include that the mass conservation in the velocity field and the charge conservation in the current density field are kept by taking characteristics of the virtual element method's discrete complex structures, the nonlinear term is handled explicitly by applying the scalar auxiliary variable method, the current density field is decoupled from the momentum equation, and the velocity field is decoupled from the Ohm's law. The unconditionally stable of the two fully discrete schemes are demonstrated. Finally, we present numerical experiment to verify the valid of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Backward-forward characterization of attainable set for conservation laws with spatially discontinuous flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a scalar conservation law with a spatially discontinuous flux at a single point x=0, and assume that the flux is uniformly convex when x\neq 0. Given an interface connection (A,B), we define a backward solution operator consistent with the concept of AB-entropy solution [4,13,16]. We then analyze the family A^{[AB]}(T) of profiles that can be attained at time T&gt;0 by AB-entropy solutions with L^\infty-initial data. We provide a characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) as fixed points of the backward-forward solution operator. As an intermediate step we establish a full characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) in terms of unilateral constraints and Ole\v{\i}nik-type estimates, valid for all connections. Building on such a characterization we derive uniform BV bounds on the flux of AB-entropy solutions, which in turn yield the L^1_{loc}-Lipschitz continuity in time of these solutions.</description>

      <title>On non-uniqueness of solitary waves on two-dimensional rotational flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solitary water waves on a rotational, unidirectional flow in a two-dimensional channel of finite depth. Ovsyannikov has conjectured in 1983 that the solitary wave is uniquely determined by the Bernoulli constant, mass flux and by the flow force. This conjecture was disproved by Plotnikov in 1992 for the ir-rotational flow. In this paper we show that this conjecture is wrong also for rotational flows. Moreover we prove that in any neighborhood of the first bifurcation point on the branch of solitary waves, approaching the extreme wave, there are infinitely many pairs of solitary waves corresponding to the same Bernoulli constant. We give a description of the structure of this set of pairs. The proof is based on a bifurcation analysis of the global branch of solitary waves which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Shape perturbation of a nonlinear mixed problem for the heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the heat equation in a domain that has a hole in its interior. We impose a Neumann condition on the exterior boundary and a nonlinear Robin condition on the boundary of the hole. The shape of the hole is determined by a suitable diffeomorphism $\phi$ defined on the boundary of a reference domain. Assuming that the problem has a solution $u_0$ when $\phi$ is the identity map, we demonstrate that a solution $u_\phi$ continues to exist for $\phi$ close to the identity map and that the "domain-to-solution" map $\phi\mapsto u_\phi$ is of class $C^\infty$. Moreover, we show that the family of solutions $\{u_\phi\}_{\phi}$ is, in a sense, locally unique. Our argument relies on tools from Potential Theory and the Implicit Function Theorem. Some remarks a the linear case complete the paper.</description>

      <title>Major symmetry of the induced tangent stiffness tensor for the Zaremba-Jaumann rate and Kirchhoff stress in hyperelasticity: two different approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recall in this note that the induced tangent stiffness tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}_{\tau}(\tau)$ appearing in a hypoelastic formulation based on the Zaremba-Jaumann corotational derivative and the rate constitutive equation for the Kirchhoff stress tensor $\tau$ is minor and major symmetric if the Kirchhoff stress $\tau$ is derived from an elastic potential $\mathrm{W}(F)$. This result is vaguely known in the literature. Here, we expose two different notational approaches which highlight the full symmetry of the tangent stiffness tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}_{\tau}(\tau)$. The first approach is based on the direct use of the definition of each symmetry (minor and major), i.e., via contractions of the tensor with the deformation rate tensor $D$. The second approach aims at finding an absolute expression of the tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}_{\tau}(\tau)$, by means of special tensor products and their symmetrisations. In some past works, the major symmetry of $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}_{\tau}(\tau)$ has been missed because not all necessary symmetrisations were applied. The approach is exemplified for the isotropic Hencky energy. Corresponding stability checks of software packages are shortly discussed.</description>

      <title>Spatial profiles of a reaction-diffusion epidemic model with nonlinear incidence mechanism and varying total population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic reaction-diffusion model with no-flux boundary conditions and varying total population. The interaction of the susceptible and infected people is describe by the nonlinear transmission mechanism of the form $S^qI^p$, where $0&lt;p\le 1$ and $q&gt;0$. In [39], we have studied a model with a constant total population. In the current paper, we extend our analysis to a model with a varying total population, incorporating birth and death rates. We investigate the asymptotic profiles of the endemic equilibrium when the dispersal rates of susceptible and/or infected individuals are small. Our work is motivated by disease control strategies that limit population movement. To illustrate the main findings, we conduct numerical simulations and provide a discussion of the theoretical results from the view of disease control. We will also compare the results for the models with constant or varying total population.</description>

      <title>Fine structure of rupture set for semilinear elliptic equation with singular nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stationary solutions of semilinear elliptic equation with singular nonlinearity $$ \Delta u=u^{-p}+f,\,\,u\geq 0\text{ in }\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n, $$ where $ n\geq 2 $, $ p&gt;1 $, $ \Omega $ is a bounded domain, and $ f\in L^q(\Omega) $ with $ \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2p}&lt;\frac{q}{n} $. We establish a sharp estimate for the Minkowski content of the rupture set $ \{u=0\} $ and demonstrate that this set is $ (n-2) $-rectifiable. For this, we examine the stratification of the rupture set based on the symmetry properties of tangent functions, leading to the proof of $ k $-rectifiability for each $ k $-stratum. As a significant byproduct of our analysis, we improve the integrability of $ D^ju $ with $ j\in\mathbb{Z}_+ $ to the optimal Lorentz space $ L^{\frac{2(p+1)}{j(p+1)-2},\infty} $, under the assumption that $ D^{j-1}f $ is bounded. As an application of our results in the static case of the equation, for a class of suitable weak solutions to the three-dimensional evolutional problem $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u-u^{-p},\,\,u\geq 0\text{ in }(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3)\times(0,T), $$ where $ p&gt;3 $ and $ T&gt;0 $, we show that $ \{u(\cdot,t)=0\} $ is $ 1 $-rectifiable for a.e. $ t\in(0,T) $.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study the quasi-linear equation \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} \mathrm{div}\, \mathcal A(x,u,\nabla u)&amp;=\mathcal B(x,u,\nabla u)&amp;&amp;\text{in }\Omega,\\ u\in H^{1,p}_{loc}&amp;(\Omega;wdx) \end{aligned} \right. \] where $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ are functions satisfying $\mathcal A(x,u,\nabla u)\sim \mathcal B(x,u,\nabla u)\sim w(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u+|u|^{p-2}u)$ for $p&gt;1$ and a $p$-admissible weight function $w$.
  We establish interior regularity results of weak solutions and use those results to obtain point-wise asymptotic estimates for solutions to \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\mathrm{div}\,(w|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)&amp;=w|u|^{q-2}u&amp;&amp;\text{in }\Omega,\\ u\in D^{1,p}&amp;(\Omega,wdx) \end{aligned} \right. \] for a critical exponent $q&gt;p$ in the sense of Sobolev.</description>

      <title>Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e. the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.</description>

      <title>Focusing $\Phi^4_3$-model with a Hartree-type nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988) initiated the study of focusing Gibbs measures, which was continued by Brydges and Slade (1996), Bourgain (1997, 1999), and Carlen, Fr\"ohlich, and Lebowitz (2016) among others. In this paper, we complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Hartree Gibbs measures in the three-dimensional setting. More precisely, we study a focusing $\Phi^4_3$-model with a Hartree-type nonlinearity, where the potential for the Hartree nonlinearity is given by the Bessel potential of order $\beta$. We first construct the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 2$, while we prove its non-normalizability for $\beta &lt; 2$. Furthermore, we establish the following phase transition at the critical value $\beta = 2$: normalizability in the weakly nonlinear regime and non-normalizability in the strongly nonlinear regime. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure, namely, the three-dimensional stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation (SdNLW) with a cubic nonlinearity of Hartree-type, forced by an additive space-time white noise, and prove almost sure global well-posedness and invariance of the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 2$ (and $\beta = 2$ in the weakly nonlinear regime). In view of the non-normalizability result, our almost sure global well-posedness result is sharp. In Appendix, we also discuss the (parabolic) stochastic quantization for the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure.
  We also construct the defocusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study the construction of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Gibbs measures, initiated by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the following phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that it is singular with respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that there exists a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely continuous. In the strongly nonlinear regime, by further developing the machinery introduced by the authors (2020), we establish non-normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. Due to the singularity of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure with respect to the massive Gaussian free field, this non-normalizability part poses a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome this issue, we first construct a $\sigma$-finite version of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that this measure is not normalizable. Furthermore, we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak limit in a natural space, even up to a subsequence.
  We also study the dynamical problem. By adapting the paracontrolled approach, in particular from the works by Gubinelli, Koch, and the first author (2018) and by the authors (2020), we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model and invariance of the Gibbs measure in the weakly nonlinear regime. In the globalization part, we introduce a new, conceptually simple and straightforward approach, where we directly work with the (truncated) Gibbs measure, using the variational formula and ideas from theory of optimal transport.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by noise that has the regularity of space-time white noise but doesn't exactly coincide with it. We show that, provided that the intensity of the noise is sufficiently weak at high frequencies, this systems admits uniform bounds in time, so that it has an invariant measure, for which we obtain stretched exponential tail bounds.</description>
