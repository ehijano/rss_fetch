      <title>Design and Implementation of Scalable Communication Interfaces for Reliable and Stable Real-time Co-Simulation of Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-simulation offers an integrated approach for modeling the large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into transmission and distribution grids. This paper presents a scalable communication interface design and implementation to enable reliable and stable real-time co-simulation of power systems with high IBR penetration. The communication interface is categorized into two types: local and remote. In local scenarios, where subsystems are connected within a single local area network (LAN), low-latency communication facilitates the seamless integration of electromagnetic transient (EMT) and phasor-domain models, enabling efficient interactions with power and energy management algorithms. For remote scenarios, data exchange is achieved via internet-based file sharing or VPN-enabled communication. The performance of both methods is evaluated using OPAL-RT as a real-time simulator, demonstrating scalability, effectiveness, and challenges specific to real-time co-simulation applications. To mitigate instability arising from data resolution mismatches in time-sensitive co-simulations, a real-time data extrapolation method is proposed. This approach significantly enhances stability and reliability, ensuring more accurate simulation outcomes. The implementation code is available on GitHub, providing researchers the tools to replicate and expand upon this work.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Infrastructure Sharing Techniques in Cellular Networks: A Percolation Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of 5G, infrastructure sharing has been identified as a potential solution to reduce the investment costs of cellular networks. In particular, it can help low-income regions build 5G networks more affordably and further bridge the digital divide. There are two main kinds of infrastructure sharing: passive sharing (i.e. site sharing) and active sharing (i.e. access sharing), which require mobile network operators (MNOs) to share their non-electronic elements or electronic elements, respectively. Because co-construction and sharing can achieve broader coverage with lower investment, through percolation theory, we investigate how different sharing strategies can deliver large-scale continuous services. First, we examine the percolation characteristics in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage graphs and the necessary conditions for percolation. Second, we propose an 'average coverage radius' to approximate the SINR graph with a low base station (BS) density based on the Gilbert disk model. Finally, we estimate the critical conditions of BS densities of MNOs for different sharing strategies and compare the percolation probabilities under different infrastructure sharing strategies.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function-Based Quadratic Programming for SafeOperation of Tethered UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) physically connected to the ground station with a tether operating in a space, tasked with performing precise maneuvers while constrained by the physical limitation of its tether, which prevents it from flying beyond a maximum allowable length. Violating this tether constraint could lead to system failure or operational hazards, making it essential to enforce safety constraints dynamically while ensuring the drone can track desired trajectories accurately. This paper presents a Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming Framework (CBF-QP) for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (TUAVs). The framework leverages nominal backstepping control to achieve trajectory tracking, augmented with control barrier functions to ensure compliance with the tether constraint. In this proposed method, the tether constraint is directly embedded in the control design and therefore guarantees the TUAV remains within a predefined operational region defined by the maximum tether length while achieving precise trajectory tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations involving set-point tracking, dynamic trajectory following, and disturbances such as incorrect user inputs. The results demonstrate that the TUAV respects the tether constraint ||x(t)||&lt;/= Lmax, with tracking errors converging to zero and the control input remaining bounded.</description>

      <title>Principles and Framework for the Operationalisation of Meaningful Human Control over Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an alignment for the operationalisation of Meaningful Human Control (MHC) for autonomous systems by proposing operational principles for MHC and introducing a generic framework for its application. With a plethora of different seemingly diverging expansions for use of MHC in practice, this work aims to bring alignment and convergence use in practice. The increasing integration of autonomous systems in various domains emphasises a critical need to maintain human control to ensure responsible safety, accountability, and ethical operation of these systems. The concept of MHC offers an ideal concept for the design and evaluation of human control over autonomous systems, while considering human and technology capabilities. Through analysis of existing literature and investigation across various domains and related concepts, principles for the operationalisation of MHC are set out to provide tangible guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to implement MHC in their systems. The proposed framework dissects generic components of systems and their subsystems aligned with different agents, stakeholders and processes at different levels of proximity to an autonomous technology. The framework is domain-agnostic, emphasizing the universal applicability of the MHC principles irrespective of the technological context, paving the way for safer and more responsible autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Laplacian dynamics on hypergraphs with cooperative and antagonistic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laplacian dynamics on a signless graph characterize a class of linear interactions, where pairwise cooperative interactions between all agents lead to the convergence to a common state. On a structurally balanced signed graph, the agents converge to values of the same magnitude but opposite signs (bipartite consensus), as illustrated by the well-known Altafini model. These interactions have been modeled using traditional graphs, where the relationships between agents are always pairwise. In comparison, higher-order networks (such as hypergraphs), offer the possibility to capture more complex, group-wise interactions among agents. This raises a natural question: can collective behavior be analyzed by using hypergraphs? The answer is affirmative. In this paper, higher-order Laplacian dynamics on signless hypergraphs are first introduced and various collective convergence behaviors are investigated, in the framework of homogeneous and non-homogeneous polynomial systems. Furthermore, by employing gauge transformations and leveraging tensor similarities, we extend these dynamics to signed hypergraphs, drawing parallels to the Altafini model. Moreover, we explore non-polynomial interaction functions within this framework. The theoretical results are demonstrated through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Bearing-Rate Approach for Observability-Enhanced Target Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-based target motion estimation is a fundamental problem in many robotic tasks. The existing methods have the limitation of low observability and, hence, face challenges in tracking highly maneuverable targets. Motivated by the aerial target pursuit task where a target may maneuver in 3D space, this paper studies how to further enhance observability by incorporating the \emph{bearing rate} information that has not been well explored in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new cooperative estimator called STT-R (Spatial-Temporal Triangulation with bearing Rate), which is designed under the framework of distributed recursive least squares. This theoretical result is further verified by numerical simulation and real-world experiments. It is shown that the proposed STT-R algorithm can effectively generate more accurate estimations and effectively reduce the lag in velocity estimation, enabling tracking of more maneuverable targets.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Design of LQG Controllers in Quantum Coherent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a differential evolution (DE) algorithm specifically tailored for the design of Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controllers in quantum systems. Building upon the foundational DE framework, the algorithm incorporates specialized modules, including relaxed feasibility rules, a scheduled penalty function, adaptive search range adjustment, and the ``bet-and-run'' initialization strategy. These enhancements improve the algorithm's exploration and exploitation capabilities while addressing the unique physical realizability requirements of quantum systems. The proposed method is applied to a quantum optical system, where three distinct controllers with varying configurations relative to the plant are designed. The resulting controllers demonstrate superior performance, achieving lower LQG performance indices compared to existing approaches. Additionally, the algorithm ensures that the designs comply with physical realizability constraints, guaranteeing compatibility with practical quantum platforms. The proposed approach holds significant potential for application to other linear quantum systems in performance optimization tasks subject to physically feasible constraints.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Carbon-Efficient Liquid-Cooled Data Center Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the environmental impact of cloud computing requires efficient workload distribution across geographically dispersed Data Center Clusters (DCCs) and simultaneously optimizing liquid and air (HVAC) cooling with time shift of workloads within individual data centers (DC). This paper introduces Green-DCC, which proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based hierarchical controller to optimize both workload and liquid cooling dynamically in a DCC. By incorporating factors such as weather, carbon intensity, and resource availability, Green-DCC addresses realistic constraints and interdependencies. We demonstrate how the system optimizes multiple data centers synchronously, enabling the scope of digital twins, and compare the performance of various RL approaches based on carbon emissions and sustainability metrics while also offering a framework and benchmark simulation for broader ML research in sustainability.</description>

      <title>Resilient Quantized Consensus in Multi-Hop Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study resilient quantized consensus in multi-agent systems, where some agents may malfunction. The network consists of agents taking integer-valued states, and the agents' communication is subject to asynchronous updates and time delays. We utilize the quantized weighted mean subsequence reduced algorithm where agents communicate with others through multi-hop relays. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for our algorithm to achieve the objective under the malicious and Byzantine attack models. Our approach has tighter graph conditions compared to the one-hop algorithm and the flooding-based algorithms for binary consensus. Numerical examples verify the efficacy of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Flat-Top Beamforming with Efficient Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-top beam designs are essential for uniform power distribution over a wide angular sector for applications such as 5G/6G networks, satellite communications, radar systems, etc. Low sidelobe levels with steep transitions allow negligible cross sector illumination. Active array designs requiring amplitude taper suffer from poor power amplifier utilization. Phase only designs, e.g., Zadoff-Chu or generalized step chirp polyphase sequence methods, often require large active antenna arrays which in turns increases the hardware complexity and reduces the energy efficiency. In our recently proposed novel array-fed reflective intelligent surface (RIS) architecture, the small ($2 \times 2$) active array has uniform (principal eigenmode) amplitude weighting. We now present a pragmatic flat-top pattern design method for practical array (RIS) sizes, which outperforms current state-of-the-art in terms of design superiority, energy efficiency, and deployment feasibility. This novel design holds promise for advancing sustainable wireless technologies in next-generation communication systems while mitigating the environmental impact of high-energy antenna arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free multiple input multiple output (CF-MIMO) systems improve spectral and energy efficiencies using distributed access points (APs) to provide reliable service across an area equivalent to multiple conventional cells. This paper presents a novel design and implementation of a CF-MIMO network leveraging the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture based testbed to enhance the performance of interference-prone user. The proposed prototype is developed based on open source software components and unlike many other prototypes, our testbed is able to serve commercial 5G user equipment (UE). The RAN intelligent controller (RIC) allows the cell-free (CF) network to access the embedded artificial intelligence and benefit from the network optimisation techniques that O-RAN brings. The testbed includes an intelligent antenna association xApp which determines the antenna group that serves each UE based on the live key performance measurements. The paper demonstrates the deployment and operation of the CF network and the xApp and discusses how the CF networks can benefit from the O-RAN architecture.</description>

      <title>Falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems using Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are often complex and safety-critical, making it both challenging and crucial to ensure that the system's specifications are met. Simulation-based falsification is a practical testing technique for increasing confidence in a CPS's correctness, as it only requires that the system be simulated. Reducing the number of computationally intensive simulations needed for falsification is a key concern. In this study, we investigate Bayesian optimization (BO), a sample-efficient approach that learns a surrogate model to capture the relationship between input signal parameterization and specification evaluation. We propose two enhancements to the basic BO for improving falsification: (1) leveraging local surrogate models, and (2) utilizing the user's prior knowledge. Additionally, we address the formulation of acquisition functions for falsification by proposing and evaluating various alternatives. Our benchmark evaluation demonstrates significant improvements when using local surrogate models in BO for falsifying challenging benchmark examples. Incorporating prior knowledge is found to be especially beneficial when the simulation budget is constrained. For some benchmark problems, the choice of acquisition function noticeably impacts the number of simulations required for successful falsification.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the resilient control problem for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) with multiple sensors, where both sides of the communication channels are affected by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. While previous work focused on characterizing Multi-Channel DoS (MCDoS), this study emphasizes the characterization of Full-Scale DoS (FSDoS). First, a partial observer technique is proposed to address the MCDoS condition. Then, an event-triggered control strategy is designed to handle FSDoS. Finally, the frequency and duration of FSDoS are analyzed to ensure the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Bounding Reachability Probabilities of Continuous-time Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents an innovative framework for constructing barrier functions to bound reachability probabilities for continuous-time stochastic systems described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The reachability probabilities considered in this paper encompass two aspects: the probability of reaching a set of specified states within a predefined finite time horizon, and the probability of reaching a set of specified states at a particular time instant. The barrier functions presented in this manuscript are developed either by relaxing a parabolic partial differential equation that characterizes the exact reachability probability or by applying the Gr\"onwall's inequality. In comparison to the prevailing construction method, which relies on Doob's non-negative supermartingale inequality (or Ville's inequality), the proposed barrier functions provide stronger alternatives, complement existing methods, or fill gaps.</description>

      <title>Real-time Tracking in a Status Update System with an Imperfect Feedback Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a status update system consisting of a finite-state Markov source, an energy-harvesting-enabled transmitter, and a sink. The forward and feedback channels between the transmitter and the sink are error-prone. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term time average of a (generic) distortion function subject to an energy causality constraint. Since the feedback channel is error-prone, the transmitter has only partial knowledge about the transmission results and, consequently, about the estimate of the source state at the sink. Therefore, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is then cast as a belief-MDP problem. The infinite belief space makes solving the belief-MDP difficult. Thus, by exploiting a specific property of the belief evolution, we truncate the state space and formulate a finite-state MDP problem, which is then solved using the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA). Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity transmission policy in which the belief-MDP problem is transformed into a sequence of per-slot optimization problems. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed policies and their superiority compared to a baseline policy. Moreover, we numerically show that the proposed policies have switching-type structures.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Simulation Framework for Power Resilience Estimation and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events poses significant risks to power distribution systems, leading to widespread outages and severe economic and social consequences. This paper presents a novel simulation framework for assessing and enhancing the resilience of power distribution networks under such conditions. Resilience is estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, which simulate extreme weather scenarios and evaluate the impact on infrastructure fragility. Due to the proprietary nature of power network topology, a distribution network is synthesized using publicly available data. To generate the weather scenarios, an extreme weather generation method is developed. To enhance resilience, renewable resources such as solar panels and energy storage systems (batteries in this study) are incorporated. A customized Genetic Algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal locations and capacities for solar panels and battery installations, maximizing resilience while balancing cost constraints. Experiment results demonstrate that on a large-scale synthetic distribution network with more than 300,000 nodes and 300,000 edges, the proposed framework can efficiently evaluate the resilience, and enhance the resilience through the installations of distributed energy resources (DERs), providing utilities with valuable insights for community-level power system resilience estimation and enhancement.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily Fast Multivariable Least-squares MRAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel least-squares model-reference direct adaptive control (LS-MRAC) algorithm for multivariable (MIMO) plants is presented. The controller parameters are directly updated based on the output tracking error. The control law is crucially modified to reduce the relative degree of the error model to zero. A complete Lyapunov-based stability analysis as well as a tracking error convergence characterization is provided demonstrating that the LS-MRAC can achieve arbitrarily fast tracking while maintaining satisfactory parameter convergence for appropriate adaptation gains. Simulation results show a significant improvement in tracking performance compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Zeroth-Order Dynamics with Projection Maps: Model-Free Feedback Optimization with Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a class of model-free feedback methods for solving generic constrained optimization problems where the specific mathematical forms of the objective and constraint functions are not available. The proposed methods, termed Projected Zeroth-Order (P-ZO) dynamics, incorporate projection maps into a class of continuous-time model-free dynamics that make use of periodic dithering for the purpose of gradient learning. In particular, the proposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms that autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of solutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while systematically guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible set for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard and asymptotical constraints in model-free optimization problems without using penalty terms or barrier functions. Moreover, the proposed dynamics have suitable robustness properties with respect to small bounded additive disturbances on the states and dynamics, a property that is fundamental for practical real-world implementations. Additional tracking results for time-varying and switching cost functions are also derived under stronger convexity and smoothness assumptions and using tools from hybrid dynamical systems. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate the above results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Discrete-time Dynamic Outer Approximation of the Intersection of Ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first discrete-time distributed algorithm to track the tightest ellipsoids that outer approximates the global dynamic intersection of ellipsoids. Given an undirected network, we consider a setup where each node measures an ellipsoid, defined as a time-varying positive semidefinite matrix. The goal is to devise a distributed algorithm to track the tightest outer approximation of the intersection of all the ellipsoids. The solution is based on a novel distributed reformulation of the original centralized semi-definite outer L\"owner-John program, characterized by a non-separable objective function and global constraints. We prove finite-time convergence to the global minima of the centralized problem in the static case and finite-time bounded tracking error in the dynamic case. Moreover, we prove boundedness of estimation in the tracking of the global optimum and robustness in the estimation against time-varying inputs. We illustrate the properties of the algorithm with different simulated examples, including a distributed estimation showcase where our proposal is integrated into a distributed Kalman filter to surpass the state-of-the-art in mean square error performance.</description>

      <title>An Exact Theory of Causal Emergence for Linear Stochastic Iteration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After coarse-graining a complex system, the dynamics of its macro-state may exhibit more pronounced causal effects than those of its micro-state. This phenomenon, known as causal emergence, is quantified by the indicator of effective information. However, two challenges confront this theory: the absence of well-developed frameworks in continuous stochastic dynamical systems and the reliance on coarse-graining methodologies. In this study, we introduce an exact theoretic framework for causal emergence within linear stochastic iteration systems featuring continuous state spaces and Gaussian noise. Building upon this foundation, we derive an analytical expression for effective information across general dynamics and identify optimal linear coarse-graining strategies that maximize the degree of causal emergence when the dimension averaged uncertainty eliminated by coarse-graining has an upper bound. Our investigation reveals that the maximal causal emergence and the optimal coarse-graining methods are primarily determined by the principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic system's parameter matrix, with the latter not being unique. To validate our propositions, we apply our analytical models to three simplified physical systems, comparing the outcomes with numerical simulations, and consistently achieve congruent results.</description>

      <title>Converse Theorems for Certificates of Safety and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the key role of control barrier functions (CBFs) in assessing safety and enabling the synthesis of safe controllers in nonlinear control systems, this paper presents a suite of converse results on CBFs. Given any safe set, we first identify a set of general sufficient conditions which guarantee the existence of a CBF. Our technical analysis also enables us to define an extended notion of CBF which is always guaranteed to exist if the set is safe. We next turn our attention to the problem of joint safety and stability, and give conditions under which the notions of control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) and compatible control Lyapunov function (CLF) and CBF pair are guaranteed to exist. Finally, we identify conditions under which a CLBF and a compatible CLF-CBF pair can be constructed from a non-compatible CLF-CBF pair. Throughout the paper, we intersperse different examples and counterexamples to motivate our results and position them within the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Grasping of Moving Objects in Dense Clutter via Global-to-Local Detection and Static-to-Dynamic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic grasping is facing a variety of real-world uncertainties caused by non-static object states, unknown object properties, and cluttered object arrangements. The difficulty of grasping increases with the presence of more uncertainties, where commonly used learning-based approaches struggle to perform consistently across varying conditions. In this study, we integrate the idea of similarity matching to tackle the challenge of grasping novel objects that are simultaneously in motion and densely cluttered using a single RGBD camera, where multiple uncertainties coexist. We achieve this by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic scenes. Notably, we introduce optimization methods to enhance planning efficiency for this time-sensitive task. Our proposed system can adapt to various object types, arrangements and movement speeds without the need for extensive training, as demonstrated by real-world experiments.
