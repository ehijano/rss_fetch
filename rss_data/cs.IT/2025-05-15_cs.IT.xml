      <title>Vendi Information Gain: An Alternative To Mutual Information For Science And Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his 1948 seminal paper A Mathematical Theory of Communication that birthed information theory, Claude Shannon introduced mutual information (MI), which he called "rate of transmission", as a way to quantify information gain (IG) and defined it as the difference between the marginal and conditional entropy of a random variable. While MI has become a standard tool in science and engineering, it has several shortcomings. First, MI is often intractable - it requires a density over samples with tractable Shannon entropy - and existing techniques for approximating it often fail, especially in high dimensions. Moreover, in settings where MI is tractable, its symmetry and insensitivity to sample similarity are undesirable. In this paper, we propose the Vendi Information Gain (VIG), a novel alternative to MI that leverages the Vendi scores, a flexible family of similarity-based diversity metrics. We call the logarithm of the VS the Vendi entropy and define VIG as the difference between the marginal and conditional Vendi entropy of a variable. Being based on the VS, VIG accounts for similarity. Furthermore, VIG generalizes MI and recovers it under the assumption that the samples are completely dissimilar. Importantly, VIG only requires samples and not a probability distribution over them. Finally, it is asymmetric, a desideratum for a good measure of IG that MI fails to meet. VIG extends information theory to settings where MI completely fails. For example, we use VIG to describe a novel, unified framework for active data acquisition, a popular paradigm of modern data-driven science. We demonstrate the advantages of VIG over MI in diverse applications, including in cognitive science to model human response times to external stimuli and in epidemiology to learn epidemic processes and identify disease hotspots in different countries via level-set estimation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mean Estimation with Coded Relayed Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a problem of statistical mean estimation in which the samples are not observed directly, but are instead observed by a relay (``teacher'') that transmits information through a memoryless channel to the decoder (``student''), who then produces the final estimate. We consider the minimax estimation error in the large deviations regime, and establish achievable error exponents that are tight in broad regimes of the estimation accuracy and channel quality. In contrast, two natural baseline methods are shown to yield strictly suboptimal error exponents. We initially focus on Bernoulli sources and binary symmetric channels, and then generalize to sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed settings along with arbitrary discrete memoryless channels.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Large Beam Codebook at mmWave Devices: How Much is Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern millimeter wave (mmWave) transceivers come with a large number of antennas, each of which can support thousands of phase shifter configurations. This capability enables beam sweeping with fine angular resolution, but results in large codebook sizes that can span more than six orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the mobility of user terminals and their randomly changing orientations require constantly adjusting the beam direction. A key focus of recent research has been on the design of beam sweeping codebooks that balance a trade-off between the achievable gain and the beam search time, governed by the codebook size. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which a large codebook can be reduced to fewer steering vectors while covering the entire angular space and maintaining performance close to the maximum array gain. We derive a closed-form expression for the angular coverage range of a steering vector, subject to maintaining a gain loss within \(\gamma\) dB (e.g., 2\, dB) with respect to the maximum gain achieved by an infinitely large codebook. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a large beam-steering codebooks (such as the \(1024^{16}\) set considered in our experiment) can be reduced to just a few steering vectors. This framework serves as a proof that only a few steering vectors are sufficient to achieve near-maximum gain, challenging the common belief that a large codebook with fine angular resolution is essential to fully reap the benefits of an antenna array.</description>

      <title>Index Modulated Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing With Spread Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a new transmission waveform that has shown excellent performance in high-mobility environments, making it a sensible option for the next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate an energy-efficient index modulation scheme for AFDM by leveraging spread spectrum, referred to as IM-AFDM-SS, to combat the interference caused by the doubly dispersive channels. Specifically, the information bits are conveyed by the transmitted symbols as well as the indices of the selected spreading codes in our proposed IM-AFDM-SS scheme. To avoid extensive computations, we also develop a lowcomplexity maximal ratio combining (MRC) detector algorithm, which recovers the spreading codes first and demodulates the symbols afterwards. Moreover, an upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed IM-AFDM-SS system with maximumlikelihood (ML) detection is derived. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IM-AFDM-SS system over the classical AFDM spread spectrum (AFDM-SS) and the existing index modulated AFDM (IM-AFDM) systems.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting $b$-symbol Codes for Locally $(\lambda, \rho,b)$-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of functions plays a central role in the design and effectiveness of function-correcting codes. By focusing on a well-defined family of functions, function-correcting codes can be constructed with minimal length while still ensuring full error detection or correction within that family. In this paper, we explore locally ($\lambda,\rho$)-functions and develop function-correcting codes using these functions for $b$-symbol read channels. We establish the recurrence relation between the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$ -function-correcting codes for the $(b+1)$-read and $b$-read channels. We establish an upper bound on the redundancy of general locally ($\lambda,\rho$, $b$)-function-correcting codes by linking it to the minimum achievable length of $b$-symbol error-correcting codes and traditional Hamming-metric codes, given a fixed number of codewords and a specified minimum distance. Specifically, we present explicit upper bounds for the classes of ($4,2t,b$)-local functions and ($2^b,2t,b$)-local functions. Additionally, for the case where $b=1$, we show that a ($3,2t,1$)-local function achieves the optimal redundancy of $3t$ under certain conditions. Moreover, we explicitly investigate locality and redundancy for the weight distribution function.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Decoding Probability and Coverage Ratio of Composite DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies two problems that are motivated by the novel recent approach of composite DNA that takes advantage of the DNA synthesis property which generates a huge number of copies for every synthesized strand. Under this paradigm, every composite symbols does not store a single nucleotide but a mixture of the four DNA nucleotides. The first problem studies the expected number of strand reads in order to decode a composite strand or a group of composite strands. In the second problem, our goal is study how to carefully choose a fixed number of mixtures of the DNA nucleotides such that the decoding probability by the maximum likelihood decoder is maximized.</description>

      <title>Short Wins Long: Short Codes with Language Model Semantic Correction Outperform Long Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel semantic-enhanced decoding scheme for transmitting natural language sentences with multiple short block codes over noisy wireless channels. After ASCII source coding, the natural language sentence message is divided into segments, where each is encoded with short block channel codes independently before transmission. At the receiver, each short block of codewords is decoded in parallel, followed by a semantic error correction (SEC) model to reconstruct corrupted segments semantically. We design and train the SEC model based on Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly outperform encoding the sentence with one conventional long LDPC code, in terms of block error rate (BLER), semantic metrics, and decoding latency. Finally, we proposed a semantic hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme to further enhance the error performance, which selectively requests retransmission depends on semantic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography: An Analysis of Code-Based and Lattice-Based Cryptosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most modern cryptographic systems, such as RSA and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, rely on "trapdoor" mathematical functions that are presumed to be computationally difficult with existing tools. However, quantum computers will be able to break these systems using Shor's Algorithm, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant alternatives. We first examine the McEliece cryptosystem, a code-based scheme believed to be secure against quantum attacks due to the hardness of decoding arbitrary linear codes. We then explore NTRU, a lattice-based system grounded in the difficulty of solving the Shortest Vector Problem. Finally, we establish connections between the structural foundations and security of the two systems.</description>

      <title>Optimized Couplings for Watermarking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) are now able to produce text that is, in many cases, seemingly indistinguishable from human-generated content. This has fueled the development of watermarks that imprint a ``signal'' in LLM-generated text with minimal perturbation of an LLM's output. This paper provides an analysis of text watermarking in a one-shot setting. Through the lens of hypothesis testing with side information, we formulate and analyze the fundamental trade-off between watermark detection power and distortion in generated textual quality. We argue that a key component in watermark design is generating a coupling between the side information shared with the watermark detector and a random partition of the LLM vocabulary. Our analysis identifies the optimal coupling and randomization strategy under the worst-case LLM next-token distribution that satisfies a min-entropy constraint. We provide a closed-form expression of the resulting detection rate under the proposed scheme and quantify the cost in a max-min sense. Finally, we provide an array of numerical results, comparing the proposed scheme with the theoretical optimum and existing schemes, in both synthetic data and LLM watermarking.

      <title>Improved Sample Upper and Lower Bounds for Trace Estimation of Quantum State Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As often emerges in various basic quantum properties such as entropy, the trace of quantum state powers $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$ has attracted a lot of attention. The recent work of Liu and Wang (SODA 2025) showed that $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$ can be estimated to within additive error $\varepsilon$ with a dimension-independent sample complexity of $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon^{3+\frac{2}{q-1}})$ for any constant $q &gt; 1$, where only an $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bound was given. In this paper, we significantly improve the sample complexity of estimating $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^q)$ in both the upper and lower bounds. In particular:
  - For $q &gt; 2$, we settle the sample complexity with matching upper and lower bounds $\widetilde \Theta(1/\varepsilon^2)$.
  - For $1 &lt; q &lt; 2$, we provide an upper bound $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{q-1}})$, with a lower bound $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{\max\{\frac{1}{q-1}, 2\}})$ for dimension-independent estimators, implying there is only room for a quadratic improvement.
  Our upper bounds are obtained by (non-plug-in) quantum estimators based on weak Schur sampling, in sharp contrast to the prior approach based on quantum singular value transformation and samplizer.</description>

Abstract: Transfer entropy (TE) is an information theoretic measure that reveals the directional flow of information between processes, providing valuable insights for a wide range of real-world applications. This work proposes Transfer Entropy Estimation via Transformers (TREET), a novel attention-based approach for estimating TE for stationary processes. The proposed approach employs Donsker-Varadhan representation to TE and leverages the attention mechanism for the task of neural estimation. We propose a detailed theoretical and empirical study of the TREET, comparing it to existing methods on a dedicated estimation benchmark. To increase its applicability, we design an estimated TE optimization scheme that is motivated by the functional representation lemma, and use it to estimate the capacity of communication channels with memory, which is a canonical optimization problem in information theory. We further demonstrate how an optimized TREET can be used to estimate underlying densities, providing experimental results. Finally, we apply TREET to feature analysis of patients with Apnea, demonstrating its applicability to real-world physiological data. Our work, applied with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, opens a new door for communication problems which are yet to be solved.</description>

      <title>Coded Downlink Massive Random Access and a Finite de Finetti Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a massive connectivity setting in which a base-station (BS) aims to communicate sources $(X_1,\cdots,X_k)$ to a randomly activated subset of $k$ users, among a large pool of $n$ users, via a common message in the downlink. Although the identities of the $k$ active users are assumed to be known at the BS, each active user only knows whether itself is active and does not know the identities of the other active users. A naive coding strategy is to transmit the sources alongside the identities of the users for which the source information is intended. This requires $H(X_1,\cdots,X_k) + k\log(n)$ bits, because the cost of specifying the identity of one out of $n$ users is $\log(n)$ bits. For large $n$, this overhead can be significant. This paper shows that it is possible to develop coding techniques that eliminate the dependency of the overhead on $n$, if the source distribution follows certain symmetry. Specifically, if the source distribution is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) then the overhead can be reduced to at most $O(\log(k))$ bits, and in case of uniform i.i.d. sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(1)$ bits. For sources that follow a more general exchangeable distribution, the overhead is at most $O(k)$ bits, and in case of finite-alphabet exchangeable sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(\log(k))$ bits. The downlink massive random access problem is closely connected to the study of finite exchangeable sequences. The proposed coding strategy allows bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between finite exchangeable distributions and i.i.d. mixture distributions to be developed and gives a new KL divergence version of the finite de Finetti theorem, which is scaling optimal.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization with Self-Interference Mitigation in MA-ISAC System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, the application in the integrated and cost-effective full-duplex (FD) monostatic systems remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we develop an MA-ISAC model within a monostatic framework, where the self-interference channel is modeled in the near field and characterized by antenna position vectors. This model allows us to investigate the use of MAs with the goal of maximizing the weighted sum of communication capacity and sensing mutual information. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex making it challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this, we employ fractional programming (FP) to propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions for both transceivers. Specifically, closed-form solutions for the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a novel coarse-to-fine grained search (CFGS) approach is employed to determine the high-quality sub-optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that with strong self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, MAs significantly enhance the overall performance and reliability of the ISAC system when utilizing our proposed algorithm, compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behaviour of Information Leakage Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information theoretic leakage metrics quantify the amount of information about a private random variable $X$ that is leaked through a correlated revealed variable $Y$. They can be used to evaluate the privacy of a system in which an adversary, from whom we want to keep $X$ private, is given access to $Y$. Global information theoretic leakage metrics quantify the overall amount of information leaked upon observing $Y$, whilst their pointwise counterparts define leakage as a function of the particular realisation $Y=y$ that the adversary sees, and thus can be viewed as random variables. We consider an adversary who observes a large number of independent identically distributed realisations of $Y$. We formalise the essential asymptotic behaviour of an information theoretic leakage metric, considering in turn what this means for pointwise and global metrics. With the resulting requirements in mind, we take an axiomatic approach to defining a set of pointwise leakage metrics, as well as a set of global leakage metrics that are constructed from them. The global set encompasses many known measures including mutual information, Sibson mutual information, Arimoto mutual information, maximal leakage, min entropy leakage, $f$-divergence metrics, and g-leakage. We prove that both sets follow the desired asymptotic behaviour. Finally, we derive composition theorems which quantify the rate of privacy degradation as an adversary is given access to a large number of independent observations of $Y$. It is found that, for both pointwise and global metrics, privacy degrades exponentially with increasing observations for the adversary, at a rate governed by the minimum Chernoff information between distinct conditional channel distributions. This extends the work of Wu et al. (2024), who have previously found this to be true for certain known metrics, including some that fall into our more general set.</description>
