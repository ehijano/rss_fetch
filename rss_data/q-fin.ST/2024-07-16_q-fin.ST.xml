      <title>Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for sparse latent factor modeling using a new sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA). This approach analyzes the co-movements of large-dimensional panel data systems over time horizons within a general approximate factor model framework. Unlike existing sparse factor modeling approaches based on sparse PCA, which assume sparse loading matrices, our sparse APCA assumes that factor processes are sparse over the time horizon, while the corresponding loading matrices are not necessarily sparse. This development is motivated by the observation that the assumption of sparse loadings may not be appropriate for financial returns, where exposure to market factors is generally universal and non-sparse. We propose a truncated power method to estimate the first sparse factor process and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases. Additionally, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. Theoretically, we establish that our estimators are consistent under mild conditions. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we analyze daily stock returns for a balanced panel of S&amp;P 500 stocks from January 2004 to December 2016. Through textual analysis, we examine specific events associated with the identified sparse factors that systematically influence the stock market. Our approach offers a new pathway for economists to study and understand the systematic risks of economic and financial systems over time.</description>

      <title>Low Volatility Stock Portfolio Through High Dimensional Bayesian Cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a Bayesian modelling technique for high dimensional cointegration estimation to construct low volatility portfolios from a large number of stocks. The proposed Bayesian framework effectively identifies sparse and important cointegration relationships amongst large baskets of stocks across various asset spaces, resulting in portfolios with reduced volatility. Such cointegration relationships persist well over the out-of-sample testing time, providing practical benefits in portfolio construction and optimization. Further studies on drawdown and volatility minimization also highlight the benefits of including cointegrated portfolios as risk management instruments.</description>

      <title>A nonparametric test for rough volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a nonparametric test for deciding whether volatility of an asset follows a standard semimartingale process, with paths of finite quadratic variation, or a rough process with paths of infinite quadratic variation. The test utilizes the fact that volatility is rough if and only if volatility increments are negatively autocorrelated at high frequencies. It is based on the sample autocovariance of increments of spot volatility estimates computed from high-frequency asset return data. By showing a feasible CLT for this statistic under the null hypothesis of semimartingale volatility paths, we construct a test with fixed asymptotic size and an asymptotic power equal to one. The test is derived under very general conditions for the data-generating process. In particular, it is robust to jumps with arbitrary activity and to the presence of market microstructure noise. In an application of the test to SPY high-frequency data, we find evidence for rough volatility.</description>
