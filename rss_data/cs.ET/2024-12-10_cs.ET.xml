      <title>Applications of Inequalities to Optimization in Communication Networking: Novel Decoupling Techniques and Bounds for Multiplicative Terms Through Successive Convex Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In communication networking, optimization is essential in enhancing performance metrics, e.g., network utility. These optimization problems often involve sum-of-products (or ratios) terms, which are typically non-convex and NP-hard, posing challenges in their solution. Recent studies have introduced transformative techniques, mainly through quadratic and parametric convex transformations, to solve these problems efficiently. Based on them, this paper introduces novel decoupling techniques and bounds for handling multiplicative and fractional terms involving any number of coupled functions by utilizing the harmonic mean (HM), geometric mean (GM), arithmetic mean (AM), and quadratic mean (QM) inequalities. We derive closed-form expressions for these bounds. Focusing on the AM upper bound, we thoroughly examine its convexity and convergence properties. Under certain conditions, we propose a novel successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm with the AM upper bound to achieve stationary point solutions in optimizations involving general multiplicative terms. Comprehensive proofs are provided to substantiate these claims. Furthermore, we illustrate the versatility of the AM upper bound by applying it to both optimization functions and constraints, as demonstrated in case studies involving the optimization of transmission energy and quantum source positioning. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed SCA method.</description>

      <title>Plagiarism Detection Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plagiarism is an act of using someone else's work without proper acknowledgment, and this sin is seen to cut across various arenas including the academy, publishing, and other similar arenas. The traditional methods of plagiarism detection through keyword matching and review by humans usually fail to cope with increasingly sophisticated techniques used to mask copy pasted content. This paper aims to introduce a plagiarism detection approach based on machine learning that utilizes natural language processing and complex classification algorithms toward efficient detection of similarities between the documents. The developed model has the capability to detect both exact and paraphrased plagiarism accurately using advanced feature extraction techniques with supervised learning algorithms. We adapted and tested our model on an extensive text sample dataset. And we demonstrated some promising results about precision, recall, and detection accuracy. These outcomes showed that applying machine learning techniques can significantly enhance the functionalities of plagiarism detection systems and improve traditional ones with robust scalability. Future work would include enlargement of the dataset and fine-tuning of the model toward more complicated cases of disguised plagiarism.</description>

      <title>A FinTech Clustering Framework: Technology, Model, and Stakeholder Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the global booming of FinTech can be seen everywhere. FinTech has created innovative disruptions to traditional, long-established financial institutions (e.g., banks and insurance companies) in financial services markets. Despite of its popularity, there are many different definitions of FinTech. This problem occurs because many existing studies only focus on a particular aspect of FinTech without a comprehensive and in-depth analysis. This problem will hinder further development and industrial application of FinTech. In view of this problem, we perform a narrative review involving over 100 relevant studies or reports, with a view to developing a FinTech clustering framework for providing a more comprehensive and holistic view of FinTech. Furthermore, we use an Indian FinTech firm to illustrate how to apply our clustering framework for analysis.</description>

      <title>IMPACT:InMemory ComPuting Architecture Based on Y-FlAsh Technology for Coalesced Tsetlin Machine Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for processing large volumes of data for machine learning models has pushed data bandwidth requirements beyond the capability of traditional von Neumann architecture. In-memory computing (IMC) has recently emerged as a promising solution to address this gap by enabling distributed data storage and processing at the micro-architectural level, significantly reducing both latency and energy. In this paper, we present the IMPACT: InMemory ComPuting Architecture Based on Y-FlAsh Technology for Coalesced Tsetlin Machine Inference, underpinned on a cutting-edge memory device, Y-Flash, fabricated on a 180 nm CMOS process. Y-Flash devices have recently been demonstrated for digital and analog memory applications, offering high yield, non-volatility, and low power consumption. The IMPACT leverages the Y-Flash array to implement the inference of a novel machine learning algorithm: coalesced Tsetlin machine (CoTM) based on propositional logic. CoTM utilizes Tsetlin automata (TA) to create Boolean feature selections stochastically across parallel clauses. The IMPACT is organized into two computational crossbars for storing the TA and weights. Through validation on the MNIST dataset, IMPACT achieved 96.3% accuracy. The IMPACT demonstrated improvements in energy efficiency, e.g., 2.23X over CNN-based ReRAM, 2.46X over Neuromorphic using NOR-Flash, and 2.06X over DNN-based PCM, suited for modern ML inference applications.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Tree Structure for Hierarchical On-Chain Asset Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Sarv, a novel non-monolithic blockchain-based data structure designed to represent hierarchical relationships between digitally representable components. Sarv serves as an underlying infrastructure for a wide range of applications requiring hierarchical data management, such as supply chain tracking, asset management, and circular economy implementations. Our approach leverages a tree-based data structure to accurately reflect products and their sub-components, enabling functionalities such as modification, disassembly, borrowing, and refurbishment, mirroring real-world operations. The hierarchy within Sarv is embedded in the on-chain data structure through a smart contract-based design, utilizing Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs). The uniqueness of Sarv lies in its compact and non-monolithic architecture, its mutability, and a two-layer action authorization scheme that enhances security and delegation of asset management. We demonstrate that Sarv addresses real-world requirements by providing a scalable, mutable, and secure solution for managing hierarchical data on the blockchain.</description>

      <title>The AI Double Standard: Humans Judge All AIs for the Actions of One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots and other artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely perceived as moral agents responsible for their actions. As AI proliferates, these perceptions may become entangled via the moral spillover of attitudes towards one AI to attitudes towards other AIs. We tested how the seemingly harmful and immoral actions of an AI or human agent spill over to attitudes towards other AIs or humans in two preregistered experiments. In Study 1 (N = 720), we established the moral spillover effect in human-AI interaction by showing that immoral actions increased attributions of negative moral agency (i.e., acting immorally) and decreased attributions of positive moral agency (i.e., acting morally) and moral patiency (i.e., deserving moral concern) to both the agent (a chatbot or human assistant) and the group to which they belong (all chatbot or human assistants). There was no significant difference in the spillover effects between the AI and human contexts. In Study 2 (N = 684), we tested whether spillover persisted when the agent was individuated with a name and described as an AI or human, rather than specifically as a chatbot or personal assistant. We found that spillover persisted in the AI context but not in the human context, possibly because AIs were perceived as more homogeneous due to their outgroup status relative to humans. This asymmetry suggests a double standard whereby AIs are judged more harshly than humans when one agent morally transgresses. With the proliferation of diverse, autonomous AI systems, HCI research and design should account for the fact that experiences with one AI could easily generalize to perceptions of all AIs and negative HCI outcomes, such as reduced trust.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Early Detection and Management of Mental Health Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health illnesses, the integration of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) has started playing a significant role. By evaluating complex data from imaging, genetics, and behavioral assessments, these technologies have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes. However, they also present unique challenges related to data integration and ethical issues. This survey reviews the development of ML and DL methods for the early diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. It examines a range of applications, with a particular emphasis on behavioral assessments, genetic and biomarker analysis, and medical imaging for diagnosing diseases like depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Predictive modeling for illness progression is further discussed, focusing on the role of risk prediction models and longitudinal studies. Key findings highlight how ML and DL can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes while addressing methodological inconsistencies, data integration challenges, and ethical concerns. The study emphasizes the importance of building real-time monitoring systems for individualized treatment, enhancing data fusion techniques, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Future research should focus on overcoming these obstacles to ensure the valuable and ethical application of ML and DL in mental health services.</description>

      <title>To Be or Not to Be (in the EU): Measurement of Discrepancies Presented in Cookie Paywalls (LONG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cookie paywalls allow visitors to access the content of a website only after making a choice between paying a fee (paying option) or accepting tracking (cookie option). The practice has been studied in previous research in regard to its prevalence and legal standing, but the effects of the clients' device and geographic location remain unexplored. To address these questions, this study explores the effects of three factors: 1) the clients' browser, 2) the device type (desktop or mobile), and 3) the geographic location on the presence and behavior of cookie paywalls and the handling of users' data.
  Using an automatic crawler on our dataset composed of 804 websites that present a cookie paywall, we observed that the presence of a cookie paywall was most affected by the geographic location of the user. We further showed that both the behavior of a cookie paywall and the processing of user data are impacted by all three factors, but no patterns of significance could be found. Finally, an additional type of paywall was discovered to be used on approximately 11% of the studied websites, coined the "double paywall", which consists of a cookie paywall complemented by another paywall once tracking is accepted.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Development of Perovskite Memristors and Algorithms for Robust Analog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog computing using non-volatile memristors has emerged as a promising solution for energy-efficient deep learning. New materials, like perovskites-based memristors are recently attractive due to their cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and flexibility. Yet, challenges in material diversity and immature fabrications require extensive experimentation for device development. Moreover, significant non-idealities in these memristors often impede them for computing. Here, we propose a synergistic methodology to concurrently optimize perovskite memristor fabrication and develop robust analog DNNs that effectively address the inherent non-idealities of these memristors. Employing Bayesian optimization (BO) with a focus on usability, we efficiently identify optimal materials and fabrication conditions for perovskite memristors. Meanwhile, we developed "BayesMulti", a DNN training strategy utilizing BO-guided noise injection to improve the resistance of analog DNNs to memristor imperfections. Our approach theoretically ensures that within a certain range of parameter perturbations due to memristor non-idealities, the prediction outcomes remain consistent. Our integrated approach enables use of analog computing in much deeper and wider networks, which significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse tasks like image classification, autonomous driving, species identification, and large vision-language models, achieving up to 100-fold improvements. We further validate our methodology on a 10$\times$10 optimized perovskite memristor crossbar, demonstrating high accuracy in a classification task and low energy consumption. This study offers a versatile solution for efficient optimization of various analog computing systems, encompassing both devices and algorithms.</description>
