      <title>Revisiting the CMB homogeneity scale: low multipoles removal effect and extragalactic foreground masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) reaches homogeneity at relatively modest angular scales compared to the expectation of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model revealing an important challenge to the theoretical predictions. We analyze this inconsistency through the homogeneity scale $H$ and the slope of the homogeneity index at $\theta = 90^\circ$. We find that the removal of low multipoles, in particular the quadrupole, from both the data and the $\Lambda$CDM synthetic CMB maps, significantly improve the consistency between models and observations. This adds to indications of the relevant contribution of the low value of the CMB quadrupole to the observed anomalies in the homogeneity scale. Due to the presence of a new extragalactic foreground in the CMB maps, we have performed statistical analyses with different masking taking into account the regions mostly affected. In particular we consider galaxies in the local neighborhood which are expected to affect more significantly the large angular scales. We find that by masking these regions, the analysis cannot solve the discrepancy between the observations and the $\Lambda$CDM model in spite of a small improvement of their mutual consistency. The studies with both foreground masking and low-$\ell$ removed CMB maps show similar results than those of the full CMB map indicating that the main discrepancy between theory and observations is associated to the quadrupole anomaly and may require more exhaustive analysis.</description>

      <title>Forecast Constraints on Bouncing Cosmology from High Frequency Gravitational Waves Using Superconducting LC Circuits and Resonant Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit forecast sensitivities to high frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) from superconducting LC circuits, traditional resonant cavity and superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with electromagnetic and mechanical modes to derive the first projections of the bounce energy scale within the generic bouncing cosmology framework over the frequency window $1\,$kHz $\lesssim f\lesssim10\,$GHz. In comparison with existing astrophysical limits (spanning $10^{-17}\,$Hz $\lesssim f\lesssim1\,$kHz and based on Planck/BICEP, PTA, and aLIGO/LISA) our HFGW forecasts yield substantially tighter constraints across a broad region of parameter space. This work unifies constraints from cosmological observations and quantum measurement experiments, providing comprehensive coverage of the early Universe gravitational wave spectrum from $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{Hz}$ to $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ and thereby probing the cosmic initial non singularity at ultra high energy scales.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic constraints on a G\"odel-type rotating universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of global cosmic rotation using a G\"odel-type rotating cosmological model, constrained through a cosmographic analysis of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) from the Pantheon+ dataset. Employing a Taylor-expanded apparent magnitude--redshift relation derived via the Kristian-Sachs formalism, we analyze low-redshift SNIa data across five redshift bins (up to $Z \leq 0.5$). Our results reveal a mild but consistent preference for cosmic rotation, with the dimensionless rotation parameter $\Omega_0$ peaking at $0.29^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ for $Z \leq 0.2$, and a broadly aligned anisotropy axis centered around equatorial coordinates $(243^\circ, -49^\circ)$. The inferred Hubble constant $h_0 \approx 0.73$ remains stable across all bins, while the deceleration parameter $q_0$ trends from near-zero to mildly negative values with increasing redshift. Model comparison using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) indicates a statistically significant preference for the rotating model over the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at intermediate redshifts. These findings suggest that cosmic rotation, if present, may influence the late-time expansion history of the universe and warrants further investigation beyond the cosmographic regime.</description>

      <title>Suzaku Observation of Merging Clusters Abell 222 and Abell 223</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous X-ray and optical studies of the galaxy cluster pair Abell 222/223 suggested the possible presence of a filamentary structure connecting the two clusters, a result that appears to be supported by subsequent weak-lensing analyses. This filament has been reported to host a primordial warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which existed prior to being heated by the interactions of the clusters. In this study, we made an attempt to examine the reported emission feature with data from an archival Suzaku observation, taking advantage of its low detector background. Because the emission is expected to be very weak, we first carefully examined all potential sources of "contamination", and then modelled the residual emission. Due to large uncertainties, unfortunately, our results can neither confirm the presence of the reported emission feature nor rule it out. We discuss the sources of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Curvature with Fast Radio Bursts and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial curvature of the Universe remains a central question in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 80 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, which is then used to obtain angular diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmological model. Then, the $H(z)$ reconstruction is combined with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$ values, we extract constraints on $\Omega_k$ under the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. Our results show consistency with a spatially flat Universe within $1\sigma$ uncertainties, although a mild preference for negative curvature is observed across both covariance-based and Gaussian analyses. This study highlights the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and demonstrates their synergy with BAO data as a powerful probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Counts-in-Cells in Redshift Space: A New Route to Cosmological Constraints from Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel extension of the volume-averaged correlation function (VACF) framework by replacing the traditional spherical smoothing kernels with anisotropic, ellipsoidal windows. This generalized approach enables the study of shape-dependent clustering statistics and captures directional information encoded in large-scale structure, particularly in redshift space where galaxy distribution is distorted by peculiar velocities. We define and compute ellipsoidal VACFs $\bar{\xi}_J (r_{\parallel}, r_{\perp})$ and the corresponding reduced cumulants $s_J (r_{\parallel}, r_{\perp})$, allowing for joint sensitivity to both scale and anisotropy across arbitrary statistical order J. Using a suite of COLA N-body simulations spanning a grid of cosmologies with varying $\Omega_M$ and $\sigma_8$, we analyze the behavior of ellipsoidal VACFs and cumulants in both real and redshift space. We find that the shape of the smoothing kernel that maximizes the clustering signal depends strongly on the redshift-space distortion regime: spherical in real space, prolate in the Fingers-of-God-dominated regime, and oblate in the Kaiser squashing-dominated regime. While the standard VACF amplitude is mainly sensitive to ${\sigma}_8$, the shape-dependence of redshift-space skewness shows a coherent response to the combined growth parameter $f \sigma_8$, with a typical sensitivity at the 1-3 $\sigma$ level between neighboring models. Our results demonstrate that ellipsoidal VACFs offer a computationally efficient and information-rich generalization of counts-in-cells analysis, with promising applications to galaxy survey data, halo catalogs, and cosmological tests of gravity beyond $\Lambda CDM$.</description>

      <title>Rapid and accurate numerical evolution of linear cosmological perturbations with non-cold relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the implementation of a new approach to the numerical evaluation of the effects of non-cold relics on the evolution of cosmological perturbations. The Boltzmann hierarchies used to compute the contributions of these relics to the stress-energy tensor are replaced with a set of integral equations. These integral equations take the form of convolutions and are solved iteratively with the rest of the system. We develop efficient algorithms for evaluating these convolutions using non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFTs). This approach enables efficient and accurate evaluation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and matter power spectra, all the way through the history of the Universe, without relying on semi-analytic approximations at late times. We implement this method in the Boltzmann solver CLASS, resulting in a new code called CLASSIER (for CLASS Integral Equation Revision), and apply it to massive-neutrino perturbations as a demonstration. The implementation is optimized to accurately capture the distinct behaviors of perturbations in both super-/near-horizon and sub-horizon regimes. Our results match the accuracy of a fully converged Boltzmann hierarchy solution while avoiding numerical artifacts from truncation of the Boltzmann hierarchy at finite multipole and offering substantial speedups depending on the required precision and the range of scales of interest. This new framework provides a practical and robust alternative for the truncated Boltzmann hierarchy approach, especially for studying beyond $\Lambda$CDM non-cold relics with signatures on small scales. CLASSIER is publicly available at https://github.com/nanoomlee/CLASSIER.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent interaction of linear gravitational and electromagnetic waves in non-magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05844v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the hybridization of linear metric perturbations with linear electromagnetic (EM) perturbations in non-magnetized plasma for a general background metric. The local wave properties are derived from first principles for inhomogeneous plasma, without assuming any symmetries of the background metric. First, we derive the effective (``oscillation-center'') Hamiltonian that governs the average dynamics of plasma particles in a prescribed quasimonochromatic wave that involves metric perturbations and EM fields simultaneously. Then, using this Hamiltonian, we derive the backreaction of plasma particles on the wave itself and obtain gauge-invariant equations that describe the resulting self-consistent gravito-electromagnetic (GEM) waves in a plasma. The transverse tensor modes of gravitational waves are found to have no interaction with the plasma and the EM modes in the geometrical-optics limit. However, for ``longitudinal" GEM modes with large values of the refraction index, the interplay between gravitational and EM interactions in plasma can have a strong effect. In particular, the dispersion relation of the Jeans mode is significantly affected by electrostatic interactions. As a spin-off, our calculation also provides an alternative resolution of the so-called Jeans swindle.</description>

      <title>Shadows of naked singularity in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observational features of exact vacuum solutions in Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, focusing on their implications for black hole shadow imaging. Motivated by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations, we revisit a class of BD solutions that exhibit a naked singularity. These solutions, despite lacking a conventional event horizon, exhibit photon spheres and produce shadow-like features. We analyze null geodesics and perform ray-tracing simulations under a simplified, optically thin accretion disk model to generate synthetic images. Our results show that BD naked singularities can cast shadows smaller than those of Schwarzschild black holes of equivalent mass. We identify the parameter space $-3/2 &lt; \omega &lt; 0$ as physically viable, ensuring attractive gravity and the absence of ghost fields. These findings suggest that BD naked singularities are possible candidates for compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>On the analogue of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in 3+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert term may play an important role in probing the strong-field regime of gravity. In this letter, we demonstrate that the local effective action reproducing the trace anomaly can resemble the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in four dimensions on specific backgrounds. The two key observations support this claim: 1) the covariant equation of the trace anomaly coincides with the trace of the metric variation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and 2) on the FRW space-time, the Friedmann-like equations in both frameworks coincide, with this correspondence extending to the quadratic and cubic perturbations. As an intrinsically four-dimensional construct, the trace anomaly effective action emerges as a promising framework for exploring higher curvature corrections to Einstein's General Relativity in a self-consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Sampling Bayesian probabilities given only sampled priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A typical Bayesian inference on the values of some parameters of interest $q$ from some data $D$ involves running a Markov Chain (MC) to sample from the posterior $p(q,n | D) \propto \mathcal{L}(D | q,n) p(q) p(n),$ where $n$ are some nuisance parameters. In many cases, the nuisance parameters are high-dimensional, and their prior $p(n)$ is itself defined only by a set of samples that have been drawn from some other MC. Two problems arise: first, the MC for the posterior will typically require evaluation of $p(n)$ at arbitrary values of $n,$ \ie\ one needs to provide a density estimator over the full $n$ space from the provided samples. Second, the high dimensionality of $n$ hinders both the density estimation and the efficiency of the MC for the posterior. We describe a solution to this problem: a linear compression of the $n$ space into a much lower-dimensional space $u$ which projects away directions in $n$ space that cannot appreciably alter $\mathcal{L}.$ The algorithm for doing so is a slight modification to principal components analysis, and is less restrictive on $p(n)$ than other proposed solutions to this issue. We demonstrate this ``mode projection'' technique using the analysis of 2-point correlation functions of weak lensing fields and galaxy density in the \textit{Dark Energy Survey}, where $n$ is a binned representation of the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Correlations between Event Rates of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts and Star Formation Rates with/without Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the redshift and luminosity distributions as well as the event rates of short Gamma-Ray Bursts (SGRBs) detected by Swift, Fermi, Konus-wind satellites. It is found that the distributions of redshift and luminosity of Fermi and Konus-wind SGRBs are identical and they obviously differ from those of Swift/BAT SGRBs. The luminosity distributions of SGRBs detected by diverse detectors can be uniformly fitted by a smoothly broken power-law function. The median luminosity of Swift SGRBs is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of Fermi/GBM or Konus-wind SGRBs. We also compare the local event rates of Swift/BAT, Fermi/GBM and Konus-wind SGRBs and find that the local rate of Swift SGRBs is around two orders of magnitude larger than that of either Fermi or Konus-wind SGRBs, while the latter two rates are comparable. The observed SGRB rates can be successfully fitted by a power-law plus Gauss function. The SGRB rates of three kinds of detectors matches the delayed/undelayed SFRs well except the delayed Lognormal and/or Gaussian SFRs at higher redshift and exceed all types of SFRs at lower redshift of $z&lt;1$. After deducting the diverse SFR components from the SGRB rates, we surprisingly notice that the remaining SGRB rates steeply decline with redshift in a power-law-like form, indicating that these SGRBs could emerge from the old star populations or compact binary star mergers.</description>

      <title>New insights on low-mass dark matter subhalo tidal tracks via numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many studies assert that dark matter (DM) subhaloes without a baryonic counterpart and with an inner cusp always survive no matter the strength of the tidal force they undergo. In this work, we perform a suite of numerical simulations specifically designed to analyse the evolution of $V_\mathrm{max}$, $r_\mathrm{max}$ and concentration of low-mass DM subhaloes due to tidal stripping. We employ the improved version of the DASH code, introduced in our previous work arXiv:2207.08652 to investigate subhalo survival. We follow the tidal evolution of a single DM subhalo orbiting a Milky Way (MW)-size halo modeled with a baryonic disc and a bulge replicating the actual mass distribution of the MW. We consider the effect of the time-evolving gravitational potential of the MW itself. We simulate subhaloes with unprecedented accuracy, varying their initial concentration, orbital parameters, and inner slope (both NFW and prompt cusps are considered). Unlike the previous literature, we examine the evolution of subhalo structural parameters -- tidal tracks -- not only at orbit apocentres but also at pericentres, finding in the former case both similarities and differences -- particularly pronounced in the case of prompt cusps. Overall, $r_\mathrm{max}$ shrinks more than $V_\mathrm{max}$, leading to a continuous rise of subhalo concentration with time. The velocity concentration at present is found to be around two orders of magnitude higher than the one at infall, being comparatively larger for pericentre tidal tracks versus apocentres. These findings highlight the dominant role of tidal effects in reshaping low-mass DM subhaloes, providing valuable insights for future research via simulations and observations, such as correctly interpreting data from galaxy satellite populations, subhalo searches with gravitational lensing or stellar stream analyses, and indirect DM searches.</description>

      <title>Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (CCHP) A Multi-Wavelength Search for the Effects of Metallicity on the Cepheid Distance Scale. Part II: Theoretical Models and Synthetic Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers exploring the effects of metallicity on the multi-wavelength properties of Cepheids in terms of their multi-wavelength period-luminosity (PL) relations, impacting their use as extragalactic distance indicators, underpinning one of the most popular paths to estimating of the expansion rate of the Universe, Ho. In Paper I (Madore &amp; Freedman 2024) we presented five tests for the influence of metallicity on galactic and extragalactic Cepheid PL relations, spanning nearly 2 dex in metallicity, and inspecting PL relations from the optical (BVI), through the near-infrared (JHK) and into mid-infrared (at 3.4 and 4.5 microns). And,in no case were any statistically significant results forthcoming. Here we interrogate published spectral energy distributions constructed from theoretical (static) stellar atmospheres, covering the surface gravity and temperature ranges attributed to classical (supergiant, F and K spectral type) Cepheid variables, and explore the differential effects of changing the atmospheric metallicity, down by 2 dex from solar (a factor of 100 below the average Milky Way value) and then up from solar by 0.5 dex (i.e., factor of 3x above the Milky Way value). The theoretical models clearly show that metallicity systematically impacts each of the bandpasses differentially: the level of this effect is largest in the ultraviolet (where line blanketing is most intense), reversing sign in the optical (due to flux redistribution from the UV), and then asymptotically falling back to zero from the red to the far infrared. The discovered effects of metallicity are systematic, but they are small; and as such they do not contradict the findings of Paper I, but they do explain why the problem has been so hard to resolve given the low level of precision of the photometry for all but the very nearest and apparently brightest Cepheids.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in the no-scale Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We add a new scalar field in the no-scale Brans-Dicke gravity and require it to have a global O(2) symmetry with the original scalar field in the Brans-Dicke gravity. This gives us a new massless scalar field in the Einstein frame due to the SO(2) symmetry. We then explicitly break the O(2) symmetry to a $D_4$ symmetry, and this scalar field gains a periodic potential. This scalar field can serve as the quintessence field to explain dark energy. If we further add the $R^2$ term and the non-minimal coupling to the Higgs field, we can realize inflation and reheating, and this leads to a super-Planckian decay constant of the quintessence potential. The super-Planckian decay constant is consistent with the newly released observational data according to a recent analysis.</description>

      <title>The Exact and Approximate Tales of Boost-Breaking Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators offer a remarkable window into the high-energy physics governing Universe's earliest moments, with the tantalising prospect of discovering new particles. However, extracting new physics from these observables requires both precise theoretical predictions of inflationary theories and accurate, analytical templates suitable for data analysis throughout parameter and kinematic spaces. In this paper, we extend the current analytical results by computing the most general boost-breaking seed correlator mediated by the tree-level exchange of a massive spinning particle. We derive the result using two complementary approaches, bootstrapping from boundary differential equations, and direct spectral integration. Both representations are packaged as a single partially resummed series that converges in all physical kinematics. Computing this correlator marks a milestone for carving out the space of all boost-breaking correlators, and therefore completes the tree-level catalogue. We then introduce a general procedure to obtain accurate approximations for cosmological collider signals based on the saddle-point method. This approach allows for a clear physical intuition of various signals hidden in correlators, as the bulk physics is made manifest through the location of these saddles in the complex time plane, which depend on the external kinematics. Evaluating the time integrals at these saddles yields results given as elementary functions that remain valid beyond soft limits and provide intuitive control over both the signal shape and amplitude. We demonstrate the power of this method in both de Sitter-invariant and boost-breaking scenarios, and uncover novel refined waveform and strength dependence for oscillatory signals from massive fields. We provide a complete cosmological collider shape template capturing all boost-breaking effects for upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Single Species Hidden Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: Cosmology and astrophysics provide various ways to study the properties of dark matter even if they have negligible non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model particles and remain hidden. We study a type of hidden dark matter model in which the dark matter is completely decoupled from the Standard Model sector except gravitationally, and consists of a single species with conserved comoving particle number and conserved comoving entropy. This category of hidden dark matter includes models that act as warm dark matter but is more general. In particular, in addition to having an independent temperature from the Standard Model sector, it includes cases in which dark matter is in its own kinetic equilibrium or is free-streaming, obeys fermionic or bosonic statistics, and processes a chemical potential that controls the particle occupation number. While the usual parameterization using the free-streaming scale or the particle mass no longer applies, we show that all cases can be well approximated by a set of functions parameterized by only one parameter as long as the chemical potential is nonpositive: the characteristic scale factor at the time of the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition. We study the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and the smallest halo mass. We show that the most significant phenomenological impact is the suppression of the small-scale matter power spectrum -- a typical feature when the dark matter has a velocity dispersion or pressure at early times. So far, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and the small dark matter halo population provide the strongest constraints, limiting the transition redshift to be larger than $\sim6.2\times10^7$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Bianchi-I type universe with SH0ES anchored Pantheon+ SNIa data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Bianchi-I cosmological model motivated by signals of statistical isotropy violation seen in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and others. To that end, we consider various kinds of anisotropic matter that source anisotropy in our model, specifically Cosmic strings, Magnetic fields, Domain walls and Lorentz violation generated magnetic fields. These anisotropic matter sources, taking one at a time, are studied for their co-evolution with standard model (isotropic) sources viz., dust-like (dark/normal) matter, and dark energy modelled as cosmological constant. We constrain the Hubble parameter, density fractions of anisotropic matter, cold dark matter (CDM), and dark energy ($\Lambda$) in a Bianchi-I universe with planar symmetry i.e., which has a global ellipsoidal geometry, and try to find signatures of a cosmic preferred axis if any. The latest compilation of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) data from Pantheon+SH0ES collaboration is used in our analysis to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters and any preferred axis for our universe. In our analysis, we found mild evidence for a cosmic preferred axis. It is interesting to note that this preferred axis lies broadly in the vicinity of other prominent cosmic anisotropy axes reported in the literature from diverse data sets. Also we find some evidence for non-zero (negative) cosmic shear and eccentricity that characterize different expansion rates in different directions and deviation from an isotropic scale factor respectively. The energy density fractions of two of the sources considered are found to be non-zero at a $2\sigma$ confidence level. To be more conclusive, we require more SNIa host galaxy data for tighter constraints on distance and absolute magnitude calibration which are expected to be available from the future JWST observations and others.</description>

      <title>CMB low multipole alignments across WMAP and \emph{Planck} data releases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from NASA's \emph{Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe} (WMAP) led to finding `alignment' anomalies not expected from fluctuations in the isotropic cosmological model. We study the data of all 8 full-sky public releases since then to test for anomalous alignments and shapes of the first 60 multipoles, i.e., over the range $2\leq l \leq 61$. We use rotationally invariant and covariant statistics to test isotropy of all subsequent WMAP data releases, along with those from the ESA's \emph{Planck} mission. Anomalous alignments among the multipoles $l=1, 2, 3$ are very consistent and robust. More alignments are detected, some of them new, while significance is diluted by the large range of the search. Power entropy, a measure of the randomness of the multipoles, is consistently anomalous at about $2\sigma$ level or better across all data releases. It appears that the CMB is not as random as the cosmological principle predicts on large angular scales</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by a generalised-NFW halo via the Fox $H$-function and its application to the super-NFW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical framework for a family of axisymmetric gravitational lenses, in which we express the lensing properties in terms of the Fox $H$-function. We apply this framework to a generalised-NFW (gNFW) profile, where we provide the power series representation of the Fox $H$-functions involved, and explore their performance and accuracy. From these power series we show that the corresponding Fox $H$-functions reduce to simple expressions in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function. We apply these results to the particular case of the super-NFW (sNFW) profile, obtaining simpler expressions, this time in terms of complete elliptic functions (which are easier to work with). When the number of images formed is maximum, the sum of their signed magnifications denoted as $I$, is constant for several lenses. We study its behaviour for the sNFW, NFW and Hernquist lenses, and show that for a fixed $\kappa_0$ (characteristic convergence), in general, $I$ is not constant ($I_{\text{min}}\leq I \leq I_{\text{max}}$), as it exhibits a strong dependence on the source position inside the radial caustic. The boundaries depend on $\kappa_0$ (and so does the average $\langle I \rangle$). Our numerical experiments suggest that for these lenses $I_{\text{min}}\to 1$ as $\kappa_0$ increases, and $I\to 1$ as $\kappa_0\to \infty$. Additionally, $I$ is constant only for a specific $\kappa_0$, which is different for each model.</description>

      <title>The First Billion Years in Seconds: An Effective Model for the 21-cm Signal with Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of the 21-cm signal are opening a window to the cosmic-dawn epoch, when the first stars formed. These observations are usually interpreted with semi-numerical or hydrodynamical simulations, which are often computationally intensive and inflexible to changes in cosmological or astrophysical effects. Here, we present an effective, fully analytic model for the impact of the first stars on the 21-cm signal, using the modular code Zeus21. Zeus21 employs an analytic prescription of the star formation rate density (SFRD) to recover the fully nonlinear and nonlocal correlations of radiative fields that determine the 21-cm signal. We introduce the earliest Population III (Pop III) stars residing in low-mass molecular-cooling galaxies in Zeus21, with distinct spectra from later Pop II stars. We also self-consistently model feedback in the form of $H_2$-dissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation, as well as dark matter-baryon relative velocities, both of which suppress star formation in the lowest-mass halos. LW feedback produces a scale-dependence on the SFRD fluctuations, due to the long mean free path of LW photons. Relative velocities give rise to "wiggles" in the spatial distribution of the 21-cm signal; we present an improved calculation of the shape of these velocity-induced acoustic oscillations, showing they remain a standard ruler at cosmic dawn. Our improved version of Zeus21 predicts the 21-cm global signal and power spectra in agreement with simulations at the $\sim 10\%$ level, yet is at least three orders of magnitude faster. This public code represents a step towards efficient and flexible parameter inference at cosmic dawn, allowing us to predict the first billion years of the universe in mere seconds.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic variance on PTAs anisotropy searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently found evidence for a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) by measuring the perturbations that this background induces in the time-of-arrivals of pulsar signals. These perturbations are expected to be correlated across different pulsars and, for isotropic GWBs, the expected values of these correlations (obtained by averaging over different GWB realizations) are a simple function of the pulsars' angular separations, known as the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation function. On the other hand, anisotropic GWBs would induce deviations from these HD correlations in a way that can be used to search for anisotropic distributions of the GWB power. However, even for isotropic GWBs, interference between GW sources radiating at overlapping frequencies induces deviations from the HD correlation pattern, an effect known in the literature as "cosmic variance". In this work, we study the impact of cosmic variance on PTA anisotropy searches. We find that the fluctuations in cross-correlations related to cosmic variance can lead to the miss-classification of isotropic GWBs as anisotropic, leading to a false detection rate of ~50% for frequentist anisotropy searches. We also observe that cosmic variance complicates the reconstruction of the GWB sky map, making it more challenging to resolve bright GW hotspots, like the ones expected to be produced from a Supermassive Black Hole Binaries population. These findings highlight the need to refine anisotropy search techniques to improve our ability to reconstruct the GWB sky map and accurately assess the significance of any isotropy deviations we might find in it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic parameterization of the dark energy equation of state within the framework of an axisymmetric (planar) Bianchi-I universe. Using the latest Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernova dataset, augmented by SH0ES Cepheid distance calibrators, we constrain both the equation of state for anisotropic dark energy and other standard cosmological parameters. Additionally, we examine the presence of an underlying anisotropic axis. Our analysis yields a mean anisotropic dark energy equation of state of $\bar{w} = -0.86^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ and a difference in the equation of states in and perpendicular to the plane of the axisymmetric Bianchi-I spacetime of $\delta_w = -0.129^{+0.090}_{-0.064}$. We also identify an axis of anisotropy at approximately $(272^{\circ}, 21^{\circ})$ in galactic coordinates. Through a comparative study of different cosmological models, we find that the data favor a Bianchi-I universe with anisotropic dark energy, where the equation of state deviates from ``-1'' along the axis of anisotropy (the $w_b$CDM model), over both other anisotropic models considered and the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM or $w$CDM models.</description>

Abstract: Intrinsic alignments (IAs) of galaxies/halos observed via galaxy imaging survey, combined with redshift information, offer a novel probe of cosmology as a tracer of the tidal force field of a large-scale structure. In this paper, we present a perturbation theory based model for the redshift-space power spectra of galaxy/halo IAs that can keep the impact of the Finger-of-God damping effect, known as a nonlinear systematics of redshift-space distortions, under control. Focusing particularly on galaxy/halo density and an IA cross power spectrum, we derive analytically the explicit expressions for the next-to-leading order corrections. Comparing the model predictions with $N$-body simulations, we show that these corrections indeed play an important role for an unbiased determination of the growth-rate parameter, and hence the model proposed here can be used for a precision test of gravity on cosmological scales.</description>

Abstract: Radio-to-$\gamma$-ray signals, recently found narrowly confined near the characteristic $2.4R_{500}$ scaled radii of galaxy clusters and groups, have been associated with their virial (structure-formation accretion) shocks based on spectro-spatial characteristics. By stacking high-latitude GMIMS radio data around MCXC galaxy clusters, we identify ($3\sigma$--$4\sigma$) excess radially polarized emission at the exact same scaled radius, providing directional support, and indicating tangential magnetic fields induced by the shocked inflow. The results suggest a strong mass dependence, a flat energy spectrum, and a high polarization fraction, consistent with synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by strong virial shocks. The narrow radial range of such stacked virial-shock signals suggests that although the shocks are theorized to have diverse, irregular morphologies, they share similar $\sim2.4R_{500}$ minimal radii.</description>

Abstract: In light of recent observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we analyse the DESI BAO data jointly with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey supernovae data, and find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Velocity-Dependent Dark Matter-Baryon Scattering from Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore interacting dark matter (DM) models that allow DM and baryons to scatter off of each other with a cross section that scales with relative particle velocity. Using the effective field theory of large-scale structure, we perform the first analysis of BOSS full-shape galaxy clustering data for velocity-dependent DM-baryon interactions. We determine that while the addition of BOSS full-shape data visibly modifies the shape of the posterior distribution, it does not significantly alter the 95% confidence level intervals for the interaction cross section obtained from an analysis of the cosmic microwave (CMB) anisotropy from Planck measurements alone. Moreover, in agreement with previous findings, we note that the DM-baryon interacting model presents a good fit to both large-scale structure (LSS) data and CMB data and alleviates the $S_8$ tension between the two data sets. After combining LSS and CMB data with weak lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, we find a $\gtrsim2\sigma$ preference for non-zero interactions between DM and baryons in a velocity-independent model. We also explore a scenario where only a fraction of DM undergoes scattering with baryons; we find a similar $\gtrsim2\sigma$ preference for the presence of interactions. Our results suggest that a suppression of the linear matter power spectrum at small scales may be needed to resolve certain discrepancies between LSS and CMB data that are found in the cold DM (CDM) scenario.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cosmological Constraints by Two-dimensional $\beta$-cosmic-web Weighted Angular Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the potential of mark-weighted angular correlation functions (MACFs), which integrate $\beta$-cosmic-web classification with angular correlation function analysis to improve cosmological constraints. Using SDSS DR12 CMASS-NGC galaxies and mock catalogs with $\Omega_m$ varying from 0.25 to 0.40, we assess the discriminative power of different statistics via the average improvement in chi-squared, $\Delta \overline{\chi^2}$, across six redshift bins. This metric quantifies how effectively each statistic distinguishes between different cosmological models. Incorporating cosmic-web weights leads to substantial improvements. Using statistics weighted by the mean neighbor distance ($\bar{D}_{\rm nei}$) increases $\Delta \overline{\chi^2}$ by approximately 40%-130%, while applying inverse mean neighbor distance weighting ($1/\bar{D}_{\rm nei}$) yields even larger gains, boosting $\Delta \overline{\chi^2}$ by a factor of 2-3 compared to traditional unweighted angular statistics. These enhancements are consistent with previous 3D clustering results, demonstrating the superior sensitivity of the $\beta$-weighted approaches. Our method, based on thin redshift slices, is particularly suited for slitless surveys (e.g., Euclid, CSST) where redshift uncertainties limit 3D analyses. This study also offers a framework for applying marked statistics to 2D angular clustering.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Fuzzy Dark Matter Inside Radial Critical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the strong gravitational lensing properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, focusing on the magnification properties near radial critical curves (CCs). Using simulated lenses we compute magnification maps for a range of axion masses and halo configurations. We show that FDM produces enhanced central magnification and secondary CCs that are not easily reproduced by standard cold dark matter (CDM), even when including subhalos. The strength and scale of these effects depend primarily on the de~Broglie wavelength, governed by the axion and halo masses. We find that axion masses in the range $m_\psi \sim 10^{-22}$--$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in galaxy-mass halos lead to distinctive magnification distributions. Our results suggest that observations of highly magnified, compact sources near radial arcs, such as quasars or supernovae, could serve as a powerful test for the presence of FDM.</description>

      <title>Bianchi spacetimes as super-curvature modes around isotropic cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.13688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful result in theoretical cosmology states that a subset of anisotropic Bianchi models can be seen as the homogeneous limit of (standard) linear cosmological perturbations. Such models are precisely those leading to Friedmann spacetimes in the limit of zero anisotropy. Building on previous works, we give a comprehensive exposition of this result, and perform the detailed identification between anisotropic degrees of freedom and their corresponding scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations of standard perturbation theory. In particular, we find that anisotropic models very close to open (i.e., negatively curved) Friedmann spaces correspond to some type of super-curvature perturbations. As a consequence, provided anisotropy is mild, its effects on all types of cosmological observables can always be computed as simple extensions of the standard techniques used in relativistic perturbation theory around Friedmann models. This fact opens the possibility to consistently constrain, for all cosmological observables, the presence of large scale anisotropies on the top of the stochastic fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark photons are compelling dark matter candidates, but their allowed kinetic mixing with the Standard Model photon is severely constrained by requiring that the dark photons do not collapse into a cosmic string network in the early Universe. Direct detection in minimal production scenarios for dark photon dark matter is strongly limited, if not entirely excluded; discovery of sub-meV dark photon dark matter would therefore point to a nonminimal dark sector. We describe a model that evades such constraints, capable of producing cold dark photons in any parameter space accessible to future direct detection experiments. The associated production dynamics yield additional signatures in cosmology and small-scale structure, allowing for possible positive identification of this particular class of production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Experimental targets for dark photon dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark photon dark matter features distinctive cosmological and astrophysical signatures and is also supported by a burgeoning direct-detection program searching for its kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon over a wide mass range. Dark photons, however, cannot necessarily constitute the dark matter in all of this parameter space. In minimal models where the dark photon mass arises from a dark Higgs mechanism, early-Universe dynamics can easily breach the regime of validity of the low-energy effective theory for a massive vector field. In the process, the dark sector can collapse into a cosmic string network, precluding dark photons as viable dark matter. We establish the general conditions under which dark photon production avoids significant backreaction on the dark Higgs and identify regions of parameter space that naturally circumvent these constraints. After surveying implications for known dark photon production mechanisms, we propose novel models that set well-motivated experimental targets across much of the accessible parameter space. We also discuss complementary cosmological and astrophysical signatures that can probe the dark sector physics responsible for dark photon production.</description>

      <title>HBT Interferometry and Quantum Nature of Primordial Gravitational Waves in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity (to be precise, its projectable version) is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. Notably, one of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It has been suggested that, for some inflationary models, the non-classicality of primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed coherent quantum state can be detected using the Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) interferometry. We show that in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves can be generated during both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras of the Universe. Moreover, the frequency range of their quantum signatures is shown to extend beyond that of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Deep inference of simulated strong lenses in ground-based surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large number of strong lenses discoverable in future astronomical surveys will likely enhance the value of strong gravitational lensing as a cosmic probe of dark energy and dark matter. However, leveraging the increased statistical power of such large samples will require further development of automated lens modeling techniques. We show that deep learning and simulation-based inference (SBI) methods produce informative and reliable estimates of parameter posteriors for strong lensing systems in ground-based surveys. We present the examination and comparison of two approaches to lens parameter estimation for strong galaxy-galaxy lenses -- Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We perform inference on 1-, 5-, and 12-parameter lens models for ground-based imaging data that mimics the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find that NPE outperforms BNNs, producing posterior distributions that are more accurate, precise, and well-calibrated for most parameters. For the 12-parameter NPE model, the calibration is consistently within $&lt;$10\% of optimal calibration for all parameters, while the BNN is rarely within 20\% of optimal calibration for any of the parameters. Similarly, residuals for most of the parameters are smaller (by up to an order of magnitude) with the NPE model than the BNN model. This work takes important steps in the systematic comparison of methods for different levels of model complexity.</description>

      <title>Collective flavor conversions are interactions of neutrinos with quantized flavor waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective oscillations in dense neutrino gases (flavor waves) are notable for their instabilities that cause fast flavor conversion. We develop a quantum theory of interacting neutrinos and flavor wave quanta, which are analogous to plasmons, but also carry flavor. The emission or absorption of such flavor plasmons $\psi$, or flavomons, changes the neutrino flavor. When an angular crossing occurs, the process $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e+\psi$ is more rapid than its inverse along the direction of the crossing, triggering stimulated $\psi$ emission and fast instability. Calculating the rate via Feynman diagrams matches the fast instability growth rate. Our novel $\nu$ and $\psi$ kinetic equations, corresponding to quasi-linear theory, describe instability evolution without resolving the small scales of the flavomon wavelength, potentially overcoming the main challenge of fast flavor evolution.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of the black hole photon ring as a probe of ultralight dilaton fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have facilitated unprecedented probing of superradiant phenomena in the vicinities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), establishing an ideal laboratory to detect ultralight bosons beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we delve into how ultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the form $f(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing simulations covering a range of photon frequencies and dilaton coupling strengths, we reveal a photon ring oscillation that follows the period of that of the dilaton field. As the dilaton mass increases, this oscillation becomes suppressed due to the washout effect of the dilaton-induced correction term over the light path integration. We further evaluated the observability of such dilaton-induced photon ring oscillations with current radio interferometric capabilities. Our estimates indicate that this effect could potentially constrain the dilaton-photon coupling to $g_{\phi\gamma}\lesssim 10^{-11}\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for dilaton masses $\mu \lesssim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

Abstract: The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to understand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic information of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and line-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging. Conventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with several parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the spherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent way as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that spherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions can be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter mass densities for given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

Abstract: Next generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will enable unprecedented tests of the concordance cosmological model and of galaxy formation and evolution. Fully exploiting their potential requires a precise understanding of the selection effects on galaxies and biases on measurements of their properties, required, above all, for accurate estimates of redshift distributions n(z). Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to simultaneously recover galaxy n(z)s and characterise the observed galaxy population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and simulations. We compare redshift distributions, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i&lt;23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are offset by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. Redshift distributions show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only parameters from the literature. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, providing accurate redshift distributions satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.</description>

Abstract: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening. The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)&gt;0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.</description>
