      <title>Towards Precise Simulations and Inference for the Neutron EDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of neutron properties, like its permanent electric dipole moment, rely on understanding complex experimental setups in detail. We show how the properties of stored and transported ultracold neutron ensembles can be simulated reliably. In a second step, we illustrate how they can be used for simulation-based inference of the parameters associated with underlying physics processes such as neutron capture or beta decay. Our proof of principle for simulation-based inference confronts a longstanding challenge with ultracold neutrons: low measurement statistics coupled with a complex apparatus.</description>

      <title>Observation of renormalization group invariance in symmetry-restored nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization group (RG) invariance implies that the predictions of effective field theory are independent of the momentum cutoffs introduced during regularization. Here we report the first systematic verification of RG invariance for realistic nuclear few-body systems within nuclear lattice effective field theory. To restore broken continuum rotational and Galilean symmetries, we employ Galilean-invariance-restoration counterterms and use a soft momentum regulator. We calibrate the two- and three-body next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) chiral forces using $A\leq 3$ observables and perform precision quantum Monte Carlo calculations to compute the $^4$He binding energy. The predicted energy remains constant across cutoffs from $250$~MeV to $400$~MeV and agrees well with the experimental value, with discrepancies of order 100 keV. Our results demonstrate the capability of extracting accurate, cutoff-independent predictions within lattice-regulated \textit{ab initio} nuclear theory.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Triggering of Nucleonic Direct Urca Processes in Neutron Stars of Specific Masses and Their Hyperon Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02988v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to analyze how hyperons affect neutrino radiation properties in nucleonic direct URCA processes, expecting to provide useful references for finding evidence of the existence of hyperons in astronomical observations. This analysis is carried out using the GM1 and NL3 parameter sets under the SU(6) and SU(3) flavor symmetries in the relativistic mean field theory framework. Combined with the inferred mass and radius values of PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, and J0740+6620, our results show that nucleonic direct Urca processes are absent in PSR J1231-1411 due to momentum conservation violation. In hyperon-containing PSR J0030+0451 (NL3 parameter set), the nucleonic direct Urca processes involving $e^{-}$/ $\mu^{-}$ would occur. A large inferred mass span induces hyperon fraction variations, affecting neutrino emissivity. If the inferred mass of PSR J0030+0451 exceeds approximately 1.8 $M_{\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity of the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry remains nearly the same as that in npe$\mu$ matter, without depending on hyperons. However, it exhibits an obvious hyperon dependence under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry. For hyperon-containing J0740+6620, the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry in GM1 parameter set predicts faster neutrino luminosity decline with hyperonic fraction than npe$\mu$ matter, and under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry in NL3 parameter set it shows monotonic decreasing trend. The research shows that hyperonic fraction significantly affect the neutrino radiation properties of the nucleonic direct URCA processes in neutron stars. Different-mass pulsars (e.g., PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, J0740+6620) exhibit the distinct nucleonic direct URCA processes behaviors, dependent on inferred masses/radii, parameter sets, and theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Origin of nucleon mass in the light of PSR J0614-3329 with quark-hadron crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent NICER observation of PSR J0614-3329, revealing the smallest reliably measured neutron star radius of $R = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km at mass $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_\odot$, provides an unprecedented constraint on the equation of state of dense matter. We investigate the implications of this measurement for the origin of nucleon mass within the parity doublet model framework, which naturally incorporates both chiral variant and chiral invariant mass components. We construct unified equations of state by employing the parity doublet model with isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$ for hadronic matter up to twice nuclear saturation density, smoothly connected to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type quark model at higher densities through a crossover transition. By systematically varying the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ and quark matter parameters, we determine which values simultaneously satisfy all current astrophysical constraints, including gravitational wave observations from GW170817, NICER measurements of several pulsars, and the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars. The inclusion of PSR J0614-3329 dramatically refines the allowed range of the chiral invariant mass from the previous constraint of $580~\text{MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860~\text{MeV}$ to $800~\text{MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860~\text{MeV}$, raising the lower bound by approximately 220 MeV. This result indicates that the chiral invariant mass must constitute at least 85\% of the nucleon mass, challenging the traditional picture of nucleon mass generation through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking alone and highlighting the importance of gluon condensation and other non-chiral mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The equation of state for neutron stars with speed of sound constraints via Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parametrized equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars is investigated by Bayesian inference method with various constraints from both nuclear physics and modern astronomical observations. The expansion coefficients correspond to the properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the density dependence of the symmetry energy. The empirical values of the symmetry energy at subsaturation density and the density of crust-core phase transition are considered to limit the low-density behavior of EOS, i.e. $L_{\mathrm{sym}} $, while the speed of sound of neutron star matter and mass-radius observations of millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 are adopted to eliminate the high-order expansion coefficients, such as $Q_{\mathrm{sat}}$ and $Q_{\mathrm{sym}} $. Finally, our analysis reveals that the skewness coefficient $Q_{\mathrm{sat}}$ of the energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) exhibits the strongest correlation with the speed of sound, constrained to $Q_{\mathrm{sat}} = -69.50_{-31.93}^{+16.52} \, \mathrm{MeV}$, whose uncertainties are much smaller than those of the experiments of heavy-ion collisions. The symmetry energy parameters are determined as follows: slope $L_{\mathrm{sym}} = 34.32_{-11.85}^{+13.66} \, \mathrm{MeV}$, curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}} = -58.45_{-89.46}^{+88.47} \, \mathrm{MeV}$, and skewness $Q_{\mathrm{sym}} = 302.28_{-231.89}^{+251.62} \, \mathrm{MeV}$. Additionally, the radii of canonical ($1.4 \, M_{\odot}$) and massive ($2.0 \, M_{\odot}$) neutron stars are predicted as $R_{1.4} = 11.85_{-0.15}^{+0.06} \, \text{km}$ and $R_{2.0} = 11.42_{-0.35}^{+0.23} \, \text{km}$, respectively, with a maximum mass of $M_{\mathrm{max}} = 2.12_{-0.05}^{+0.11} \, M_{\odot}$. The tidal deformability is $\Lambda_{1.4} = 303.57_{-45.22}^{+47.95}$ at $1.4 \, M_\odot$, which is consistent with the analysis of the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Suppression of dynamical momentum-space shell by chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the appearance of quark degrees of freedom in dense isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. We employ the parity doublet model to incorporate chiral dynamics. Specifically, we contrast quarkyonic matter, in which quarks occupy states above the nucleon Fermi surface, with baryquark matter, in which quarks populate states inside the nucleonic Fermi sea. We find that while baryquark matter is generally energetically favored over quarkyonic matter, the self-consistent treatment of the momentum-space shell reveals that purely hadronic matter provides the lowest free energy up to densities well beyond nuclear saturation. Consequently, the contribution of quarks is not relevant within the model's domain of applicability, even though chiral symmetry becomes restored. This demonstrates that the onset of quark degrees of freedom and the restoration of chiral symmetry need not coincide.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from Quark-Gluon Plasma at finite baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Bayesian calibrated iEBE-MUSIC framework, we compute the production of electromagnetic radiation from hot hadronic matter at finite baryon density. Results for thermal photon and thermal dilepton yields are obtained by folding in-medium emission rates with posterior-sampled backgrounds evolved hydrodynamically. We consider different photon sources and analyze the collision-energy dependence of the thermal-to-prompt photon ratio. The sensitivity of the dilepton spectra to the pre-equilibrium stage is explored by considering different initialization procedures. Finally, we examine the impact on dilepton spectra of choosing parameter sets stemming from different Bayesian data analyses.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of properties of nuclear matter with the FOPI experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) transport model, combined with experimental data of directed flow, elliptic flow, and nuclear stopping power measured by FOPI in $\rm ^{197}Au+^{197}Au$ collisions at beam energies ($E_{lab}$) of 0.25 and 0.4 GeV/nucleon, the incompressibility of the nuclear equation of state $K_0$, the nucleon effective mass $m^*$, and the in-medium correction factor ($F$, with respect to free-space values) on the nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections are studied by Bayesian analysis. It is found that both $m^*$ and $F$ can be tightly constrained with the uncertainty $\le$ 15\%, however, $K_0$ cannot be constrained tightly. We deduce $m^*/m_0 = 0.78^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ and $F = 0.75^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ with experimental data at $E_{lab}$ = 0.25 GeV/nucleon, and the obtained values increased to $m^*/m_0 = 0.88^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ and $F = 0.88^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ at $E_{lab}$ = 0.4 GeV/nucleon. The obtained results are further verified with rapidity-dependent flow data.</description>

      <title>Color-superconducting quarkyonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the role of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter under the conditions of color and electric neutrality at $\beta$- and strong equilibrium, as relevant for neutron stars. By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor chirally imbalanced quark matter beyond large-$N_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a chirally imbalanced medium in the context of the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using both the large-$N_c$ (LN) and beyond large-$N_c$ (BLN) approximations. To incorporate BLN effects, we consider the optimized perturbation theory (OPT) to the first nontrivial order, which includes two-loop (exchange) contributions. This procedure allows us to explicitly explore how finite $N_c$ corrections affect the thermodynamics as well as the phase diagram of chirally imbalanced quark matter. We then compare the results obtained with a sharp three-dimensional cutoff -- generically referred to as the traditional regularization scheme (TRS) -- and with an alternative procedure called the medium separation scheme (MSS). In the first case, we observe that the pseudocritical temperature decreases as the chiral chemical potential increases, an effect dubbed inverse chiral catalysis (ICC). On the other hand, when considering the MSS regularization, which properly isolates the medium contributions from the vacuum, we find the opposite result. We show that the results obtained with MSS are consistent with well-established LQCD data in both the LN and BLN approximations. Finally, we suggest that to cope with the high-density limit, the standard OPT interpolation prescription must be modified with the inclusion of an extra variational parameter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the first-order QCD phase transition in dense strong interaction matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD in the low temperature and high density region, where a strong, first-order phase transition is expected beyond the critical end point. By solving the quark gap equation in the continuum QCD approach, we reveal the coexistence of the multi-phases both in the microscopic dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and also in the thermodynamic observables, which suggests the existence of spinodal decomposition during the first-order QCD phase transitions. We also analyse the interface structure of the co-exist Nambu and Wigner phases in the isothermal process during the first-order transition. In particular, the interface tension and interface entropy density are extracted from the isothermal trajectories, which further allows for an analysis on the formation of nuclear bubble, including the bubble radius and its stability at different temperatures. Our predictions may serve as useful inputs for further investigations in heavy-ion physics or astrophysics research.</description>

      <title>Lee--Yang edge singularities in Nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD phase diagram and the associated Lee--Yang edge singularities using the two-flavor nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model extended to complex chemical potential. There exists a strong correlation between the chiral phase transition and the structure of the effective potential in the complex order parameter plane, serving as a criterion to differentiate crossover from first-order transitions. Typically, the Lee--Yang edge singularities can be understood as a generalization of the critical end-point (CEP) between crossover and first-order transitions, where the positive Nambu phase and the Wigner phase coalesce. We further analyze the scaling behavior near the CEP by extracting the critical exponent associated with the Lee--Yang singularities. Additionally, we confirm that the extrapolation of the Lee--Yang edge singularity trajectories provides an effective method of determining the CEP location, even at a small real chemical potential. This provides a viable method for exploring regions of the QCD phase diagram that remain inaccessible to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>The role of the soft scale for $J/\psi$ production in the transverse momentum dependent framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use vNRQCD to study power corrections in the ${\rm v}$ expansion due to soft gluon radiation during $J/\psi$ production at small transverse momentum. We categorize four new $J/\psi$ production operators that mediate the transition of perturbatively produced color-octet charm quark/anti-quark pairs to charm quarks in a $^3S_1^{[1]}$ state via soft gluon emission. We then use Soft Collinear Effective Theory and vNRQCD to derive a factorization theorem for $J/\psi$ production in SIDIS in terms of the gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) PDFs in the proton and new objects which we call TMD soft transition functions. We show that the TMD soft transition function leads in the ${\rm v}$ power-counting with respect to the color-octet TMD shape functions that have been used in previous studies of $J/\psi$ production at small transverse momentum.</description>

Abstract: Recent detections of kilonova-like emission following long-duration gamma-ray bursts GRB211211A and GRB230307A have been interpreted as originating from the merger of two neutron stars. In this work, we demonstrate that these observations are also consistent with nucleosynthesis originating from a collapsar scenario. Our model accurately predicts the observed optical and infrared light curves using a single weak $r$-process component. The absence of lanthanide-rich material in our model, consistent with the data, challenges the prevailing interpretation that a red evolution in such transients necessarily indicates the presence of heavy $r$-process elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in charmed hadron physics, driven by numerous experimental discoveries of exotic states such as $T^+_{cc}$ and $P_c$. These findings have highlighted the importance of understanding charmed hadron interactions. With significant advances in theory and computation, lattice QCD has become a reliable tool for studying nonperturbative dynamics of low-energy QCD. In this talk, I review recent lattice QCD studies of charmed hadron interactions, focusing on three representative systems: $D^*$-$D$, $N$-$c\bar c$, and $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$.</description>

      <title>Confronting the production mechanisms of nuclei with deuteron and proton-triggered balance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultra high-energy collisions, nuclei with very low binding energies are not expected to survive the dense and hot final state environment. The traditional view has therefore been that nuclei form via coalescence after the hot environment has dissipated. However, statistical thermal models, where hadrons are produced from a fireball at thermal equilibrium, can describe the relative abundances of light nuclei in pp and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC equally well. In this paper we investigate if balance functions triggered by protons and deuterons can be used to distinguish between the two production mechanisms. The coalescence model is investigated using PYTHIA, while the statistical thermal model is examined using the Thermal-FIST package. We find that for both models the same simple relation between proton and deuteron triggered balance functions is applicable. However, there is a striking difference between the two models when the transverse momentum of trigger particles is varied. This dependence offers a promising observable to discriminate between the two production scenarios that goes beyond nuclei production.</description>

      <title>Parquet theory for molecular systems. I. Formalism and static kernel parquet approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Wigner function of a rigidly rotating and magnetized QED plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Wigner function of a rigidly rotating quantum electrodynamics (QED) plasma in the presence of a constant magnetic field by utilizing the Riemannian normal coordinate approximation, which has been previously proposed in the literature. In this approach, the angular velocity appears only in a specific phase factor, allowing us to compute the point-split fermion two-point correlation function in flat spacetime. To ensure that the fermion correlation function is gauge invariant, we introduce a background gauge field that is fixed to produce a constant magnetic field. Using this Wigner function, we derive the energy-momentum tensor for this medium, which consists of both diagonal and off-diagonal components. By comparing our results with the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal spinful and vortical magnetized fluid, we establish a connection between these components and thermodynamic quantities, such as energy density and different types of pressure. We demonstrate that rigid rotation leads to pressure anisotropy in plasma. Additionally, we compute the associated vector and axial vector currents for this medium, utilizing the previously presented Wigner function. Our results are consistent with existing literature on the subject.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Hulth\`en-Kohn method suggested by V. D. Efros [Phys. Rev. C 99, 034620 (2019)] for calculating various observables in the continuum and discrete spectrum using two-body interactions in single- and coupled-channel systems. This method is promising for many-body applications and ab initio description of nuclear reactions. We explore the convergence of phase shifts and wave functions as well as the location of S-matrix poles which enables obtaining both resonance and bound state parameters. We find that adopting wave functions from approximate bound-state solutions for the short-range components of basis wave functions leads to good convergence.</description>

      <title>Adressing the p{\Omega}- interaction and di-baryonic states via femtoscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental measurements of the p$\Omega^-$ correlation function and the concurrent theoretical efforts to describe the strong interaction among hadrons in the strangeness sector, we present a data-driven approach for fine tuning of a meson-exchanges potential for the p$\Omega^-$ system. Using femtoscopy data from the ALICE and STAR collaborations, we constrain the strength of the interaction, encoded in the tunable short-range parameter introduced in the potential. The resulting model provides a good description of the measured correlation functions and favors the existence of a bound state in the \({}^5S_2\) channel with a binding energy of approximately \(0.5\,\mathrm{MeV}\). The role of the \({}^3S_1\) channel, however, remains poorly constrained due to the absence of an accurate model accounting for its inelastic contributions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic plane wave predictions of polarization transfer observables for ($\vec{p},2\vec{p}\,$) knockout reactions from the 3s$_{1/2}$ state in $^{208}$Pb at 392 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exclusive ($\vec{p},2\vec{p}$) reactions are often described within the Relativistic Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation (RDWIA) model to include nuclear distortion effects. The Relativistic Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (RPWIA) model, on the other hand, neglects these effects on the incident and outgoing proton wave functions. Our aim is to identify kinematic regions where the RPWIA model quantitatively describes energy-sharing analyzing power (A$_y$) and qualitatively describes the unpolarized triple differential cross section ($\sigma$) data. Where no data exist, we also seek regions where RPWIA gives similar results of the complete set of polarization transfer observables (D$_{i'j}$) compared to RDWIA. The sensitivity of the RPWIA predictions to different Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) models will be assessed. For an incident 392 MeV proton beam and coplanar scattering angles, $\theta_{a'} = 32.5^\circ$ and $\theta_{b'} = -50.0^\circ$, the RPWIA predictions of $\sigma$ and A$_y$ are compared to published data for ($\vec{p},2\vec{p}$) knockout from the 3s$_{1/2}$ state in $^{208}$Pb. In the RPWIA model the proton wave functions are treated as Dirac plane waves, the $NN$ interaction is modeled using the relativistic IA1 parameterization of the Relativistic Impulse Approximation (RIA) framework, and the boundstate wave functions are extracted from the RMF models. We found that within a range of $\pm10$ MeV around the peak of $\sigma$, the RPWIA and RDWIA models quantitatively describe the A$_y$ data and qualitatively the $\sigma$. Here, the RPWIA and RDWIA predictions agree for D$_{i'j}$. While $\sigma$ is sensitive to the RMF models, D$_{i'j}$ is not. Thus concluding that RPWIA can be applied to quantitative description of D$_{i'j}$ in a limited range for proton knockout from the 3s$_{1/2}$ state in $^{208}$Pb, and qualitatively describe the shape of $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Conflation of Ensemble-Learned Nuclear Mass Models for Enhanced Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble learning algorithms, the gradient boosting and bagging regressors, are employed to correct the residuals of nuclear mass excess for a diverse set of six nuclear mass models. The weighted average of these corrected residuals reduces due to their partial cancellation, yielding a significant improvement in nuclear mass predictions. Our conflated model, which integrates ensemble learning and model averaging (ELMA), achieves a root mean square error of approximately 65 keV, well below the critical threshold of 100 keV, for the complete data set of Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020). The validity of ELMA is demonstrated through the evaluation of $Q$ values for $\alpha$ decay, showing a marked decrease in deviations from experimental data relative to predictions from individual nuclear mass models. We have also compiled a table of nuclear mass excesses and binding energies for about 6,300 nuclei, which serves as a valuable resource for various nuclear physics applications and is publicly accessible via the ELMA web interface (https://ddnp.in).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky formalism is employed to investigate the band structure of $^{115}$I from low to high spin. A set of eight rotational bands with well established spins and parities are analyzed. Five bands start at low spin and are assigned to the single-particle proton orbitals ($d_{5/2}$, $g_{7/2}$), $g_{9/2}$, and $h_{11/2}$, which are close to the Z=53 Fermi surface for a deformation of $\varepsilon_2=0.2$. The analysis of the observed level energies relative to a rotating liquid drop and spins versus $\gamma$-ray energies allow to track the evolution of the configurations with increasing spin. It is of special interest that one band in the valence space is observed to a smooth termination at $I_{max} = 67/2^+$.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies require an intense phase of multiple interactions between the created particles. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\sqrt{n_{\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical conductivities and the moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Positive Parity Dibaryons with Maximal Charm and Strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons composed of single-flavor quarks, specifically systems with strangeness $\mathcal{S} = -6$ and charm $\mathcal{C} = 6$. Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators realized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices with carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state energy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their binding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy separation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon thresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state, while the $\Omega$-$\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to be unbound.</description>
