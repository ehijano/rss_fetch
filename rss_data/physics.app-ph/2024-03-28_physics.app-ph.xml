      <title>Combine Influences of Nanoparticulate Hematite Thin Film Thickness, Roughness, and Weight on Its Photoelectrochemical Performance and Viscous/ Thermal Characteristics of Source Precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work was to investigate the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of nanoparticulate hematite thin film photoelectrodes prepared by a soft-chemistry route. Two cost-effective thin film fabrication techniques were employed to deposit the hematite film. First, the film was deposited on conducting glass substrates by dip coating of the organic precursor containing fatty acid derivatives of iron salts. Process parameters such as the concentration of iron oleic acid derivative precursor solution, the thickness of the organic film, before annealing and the number of deposited layers along with their weight and roughness were studied. In the second approach, the influence of the spin coating process on film formation and respective photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance have been discussed. It was found that the PEC performance of spin-coated samples was lower than that of dip coated samples due to the effect of films rough and smooth characteristics. It is found that the rough surface of the photoelectrode is a prerequisite to achieving good photocurrent values. Here, three-layer samples with roughness between 600nm to 800nm and bulk thickness up to 700nm provided photocurrent densities of 0.6mA/cm2. In part 2 of the manuscript, we have elaborately discussed the roughness and smooth behavior of thin films using X-ray reflectometry technique. Followed by this, a detailed account of the viscous and thermal properties of the fatty acid derivatives of iron precursor have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Strain distribution in WS2 monolayers detected through Polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) show great promise for future electronic devices. Nevertheless, GRMs result distinct properties under the influence of the substrate that serves as support through uneven compression/ elongation of GRMs surface atoms. Strain in GRM monolayers is the most common feature that alters the interatomic distances, band structure, providing a new degree of freedom that allows regulation of their electronic properties and introducing the field of straintronics. Having an all-optical detection, a minimally invasive tool that rapidly probes strain in large areas of GRM monolayers, would be of great importance in the research and development of novel 2D devices. Here, we use Polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation (P-SHG) optical imaging to identify strain distribution, induced in a single layer of WS2 placed on a pre-patterned Si/SiO2 substrate with cylindrical wells. By fitting the P-SHG data pixel-by-pixel, we produce spatially resolved images of the crystal armchair direction. In regions where the WS2 monolayer conforms to the pattern topography, a distinct cross-shaped pattern is evident in the armchair image owing to strain. The presence of strain in these regions is independently confirmed using a combination of atomic force microscopy and Raman mapping.</description>

      <title>Environmental monitoring using orbital angular momentum mode decomposition enhanced machine learning</title>

Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical cavities based on epitaxial GaP on nominally (001)-oriented Si</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gallium phosphide (GaP) has recently received considerable attention as a suitable material for building photonic integrated circuits due to its remarkable optical and piezoelectric properties. Usually, GaP is grown epitaxially on III-V substrates to keep its crystallinity and later transferred to silicon wafers for further processing. Here, an alternative promising route for the fabrication of optomechanical (OM) cavities on GaP epitaxially grown on nominally (001)-oriented Si is introduced by using a two-step process consisting of a low-temperature etching of GaP followed by selective etching of the underneath silicon. The low-temperature (-30 $^o$C) during the dry-etching of GaP hinders the lateral etching rate, preserving the pattern with a deviation between the design and the pattern in the GaP layer lower than 5 %, avoiding the complex process of transferring and bonding a GaP wafer to a silicon-on-insulator wafer. To demonstrate the quality and feasibility of the proposed fabrication route, suspended OM cavities are fabricated and experimentally characterized. The cavities show optical quality factors between 10$^3$ and 10$^4$, and localized mechanical resonances at frequencies around 3.1 GHz. Both optical and mechanical resonances are close to those previously reported on crystalline GaP structures. These results suggest a simple and low-cost way to build GaP-based photonic devices directly integrated on industry-standard Si(001) photonic wafers.</description>

      <title>The role of chemo-mechanical modelling in the development of battery technology -- a perspective</title>

Abstract: In the race to reduce global CO2 emissions and achieve net-zero, chemomechanics must play a critical role in the technological development of current and next-generation batteries to improve their energy storage capabilities and their lifetime. Many degradation processes arise through mechanics via the development of diffusion-induced stress and volumetric strains within the various constituent materials in a battery. From particle cracking in lithium-ion batteries to lithium dendrite-based fracture of solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries, it is clear that significant barriers exist in the development of these energy storage systems, where chemomechanics plays a central part. To accelerate technological and scientific advances in this area, multi-scale and highly coupled multiphysics modelling must be carried out that includes mechanics-based phenomena. In this perspective article, we provide an introduction to chemomechanical modelling, the various physical problems that it addresses, and the issues that need to be resolved in order to expand its use within the field of battery technology.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-power, microwave-multiplexed qubit controller using adiabatic superconductor logic</title>

Abstract: Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small (~10 $\mu$W at ~10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit. Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results show an output power of approximately $-$80 dBm and on/off ratio of ~40 dB at each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing sideband signals.</description>

      <title>Multimaterial Inkjet Printing of Mechanochromic Materials</title>

Abstract: Inkjet printing technology achieves the precise deposition of liquid-phase materials via the digitally controlled formation of picoliter-sized droplets. Beyond graphical printing, inkjet printing has been employed for the deposition of separated drops on surfaces or the formation of continuous layers, which allows to construct materials gradients or periodic features that provide enhanced functionalities. Here, we explore the use of multinozzle, drop-on-demand piezoelectric inkjet technology for the manufacturing of mechanochromic materials, i.e., materials that change their color or fluorescence in response to mechanical deformation. To accomplish this, suitable polyurethane polymers of differing hardness grades were tested with a range of organic solvents to formulate low-viscosity, inkjet-printable solutions. Following their rheological characterization, two solutions comprised of "soft" and "hard" polyurethanes were selected for in-depth study. The solutions were imbibed with a mechanochromic additive to yield fluorescent inks, which were either dropcast onto polymeric substrates or printed to form checkerboard patterns of alternating hardness using a lab-built, multimaterial inkjet platform. Fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy were used to identify different hardness grades in the dropcast and printed materials, as well as to monitor the responses of these gradient materials to mechanical deformation. The insights gained in this study are expected to facilitate the development of inkjet-printable, mechanochromic polymer materials for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Terahertz detection with graphene FETs: photothermoelectric and resistive self-mixing contributions to the detector response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-effect transistors coupled to integrated antennas (TeraFETs) are photodetectors being actively developed for the THz frequency range ($\sim$ 100 GHz - 10 THz). Among them, Graphene TeraFETs (G-TeraFETs) have demonstrated distinctive photoresponse features compared to those made from elementary semiconductors. For instance, previous studies have shown that G-TeraFETs exhibit a THz response that comprises two components: the resistive self-mixing (RSM) and photothermoelectric effect (PTE). The RSM and PTE arise from carrier density oscillations and carrier heating, respectively. In this work, we confirm that the photoresponse can be considered a combination of RSM and PTE, with PTE being the dominant rectification mechanism at higher frequencies. For our CVD G-TeraFETs with asymmetric antenna coupling, the PTE response dominates over the RSM at frequencies above 100 GHz. We find that relative contribution of RSM and PTE to the photoresponse is strongly frequency dependent. Electromagnetic wave simulations show that this behavior is due to the relative change in the total dissipated power between the gated and ungated channel regions of the G-TeraFET as the frequency increases. The simulations also indicate that the channel length over which the PTE contributes to the photoresponse below the gate electrode is approximately the same as the electronic cooling length. Finally, we identify a PTE contribution that can be attributed to the contact doping effect in graphene close to the metal contacts. Our detectors achieve a minimum optical noise-equivalent power of 101 (114) pW/$\sqrt{Hz}$ for asymmetric (symmetric) THz antenna coupling conditions at 400 GHz. This work demonstrates how the PTE response can be used to optimize the THz responsivity of G-TeraFETs.</description>

      <title>Designing a K-state P-bit Engine</title>

Abstract: Probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based compute engines utilize the unique capability of a p-bit to probabilistically switch between two states to solve computationally challenging problems. However, when solving problems that require more than two states (e.g., problems such as Max-3-Cut, verifying if a graph is K-partite (K&gt;2) etc.), additional pre-processing steps such as graph reduction are required to make the problem compatible with a two-state p-bit platform. Moreover, this not only increases the problem size by entailing the use of auxiliary variables but can also degrade the solution quality. In this work, we develop a unique framework for implementing a K-state (K&gt;2) p-bit engine. Furthermore, from an implementation standpoint, we show that such a K-state p-bit engine can be implemented using N traditional (2-state) p-bits, and one multi-state p-bit -- a novel concept proposed here. Augmenting traditional p-bit platforms, our approach enables us to solve an archetypal combinatoric problem class requiring multiple states, namely Max-K-Cut (K=3, 4 shown here), without using any additional auxiliary variables. Thus, our work fundamentally advances the functional capability of p-bit engines, enabling them to solve a broader class of computationally challenging problems more efficiently.</description>
