      <title>KINDLE: Knowledge-Guided Distillation for Prior-Free Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular decision-making processes. Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.</description>

      <title>TRENDY: Gene Regulatory Network Inference Enhanced by Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a crucial role in the control of cellular functions. Numerous methods have been developed to infer GRNs from gene expression data, including mechanism-based approaches, information-based approaches, and more recent deep learning techniques, the last of which often overlook the underlying gene expression mechanisms. In this work, we introduce TRENDY, a novel GRN inference method that integrates transformer models to enhance the mechanism-based WENDY approach. Through testing on both simulated and experimental datasets, TRENDY demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we apply this transformer-based approach to three additional inference methods, showcasing its broad potential to enhance GRN inference.</description>

      <title>What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>QWENDY: Gene Regulatory Network Inference Enhanced by Large Language Model and Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is important for understanding various biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present a method, QWENDY, that uses single-cell gene expression data measured at four time points to infer GRNs. Based on a linear gene expression model, it solves the transformation for the covariance matrices. Unlike its predecessor WENDY, QWENDY avoids solving a non-convex optimization problem and produces a unique solution. Then we enhance QWENDY by the transformer neural networks and large language models to obtain two variants: TEQWENDY and LEQWENDY. We test the performance of these methods on two experimental data sets and two synthetic data sets. TEQWENDY has the best overall performance, while QWENDY ranks the first on experimental data sets.</description>
