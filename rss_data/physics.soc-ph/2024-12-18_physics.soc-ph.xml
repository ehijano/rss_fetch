      <title>Fisheries Problems and Bureaucracy in Aquaculture Anti-Commons View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems raised by anti-commons and bureaucracy have been linked since the study of Buchanan and Yoon (2000). Bureaucracy involves a multitude of agents that have deciding power. At the view of conflicting interests, the decision makers inertia or the inertia of the system itself, excessive administrative procedures or too many administrative circuits push for too late decisions, or for non-rational decisions in terms of value creation for economic agents. Property Rights Theory explains new concerns. Considering that an anti-commons problem arises when there are multiple rights to exclude, the problem of decision process in aquaculture projects makes sense at this level. However, little attention has been given to the setting where more than one person is assigned exclusion rights, which may be exercised. Anti-commons problem is analyzed in situations in which resources are inefficiently under-utilized rather than over-utilized as in the familiar commons setting. In this study, fisheries problems are studied and some ways to deal with the problem are presented.</description>

      <title>A Techno-Economic Analysis of the Interconnectedness between Energy Resources, Climate Change, and Sustainable Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract: The rising global temperatures caused by climate change significantly impact energy consumption and electricity generation. Fluctuating temperatures and frequent extreme weather events disrupt energy production and consumption patterns. Addressing these challenges has become a priority, prompting governments, industries, and societies to pursue sustainable development and embrace eco-friendly economies. This strategy aims to decouple economic growth from environmental harm, ensuring a sustainable future for generations. Understanding the link between climate change, energy resources, and sustainable development is crucial. Techno-economic analysis provides a framework for evaluating energy-related projects and policies, guiding decision-makers toward sustainable solutions. A case study highlights the interaction between hydroponic unit energy needs, electricity pricing from wind farms, and product sales prices. Findings suggest that smaller 2-megawatt investments are more efficient and adaptable than larger 18-megawatt projects, proving economically viable and technologically flexible. However, such investments must also consider their social and environmental impacts on local communities. Sustainable development seeks to ensure that progress benefits all stakeholders while protecting the environment. Achieving this requires collaboration among governments, businesses, researchers, and individuals. By fostering innovation, adopting eco-friendly practices, and creating supportive policies, society can transition to a green economy, mitigating climate change and promoting a sustainable, resilient future.</description>

      <title>Information, entropy and the paradox of choice: A theoretical framework for understanding choice satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choice overload occurs when individuals feel overwhelmed by an excessive number of options. Experimental evidence suggests that a larger selection can complicate the decision-making process. Consequently, choice satisfaction may diminish when the costs of making a choice outweigh its benefits, indicating that satisfaction follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with the size of the choice set. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we present a theoretical framework based on relative entropy and effective information to elucidate the inverted U-shaped relationship between satisfaction and choice set size. We begin by positing that individuals assign a probability distribution to a choice set based on their preferences, characterized by an observed Shannon entropy. We then define a maximum entropy that corresponds to a worst-case scenario where individuals are indifferent among options, leading to equal probabilities for all alternatives. We hypothesized that satisfaction is related to the probability of identifying an ideal choice within the set. By comparing observed entropy to maximum entropy, we derive the effective information of choice probabilities, demonstrating that this metric reflects satisfaction with the options available. For smaller choice sets, individuals can more easily identify their best option, resulting in a sharper probability distribution around the preferred choice and, consequently, minimum entropy, which signifies maximum information and satisfaction. Conversely, in larger choice sets, individuals struggle to compare and evaluate all alternatives, leading to missed opportunities and increased entropy. This smooth probability distribution ultimately reduces choice satisfaction, thereby producing the observed inverted U-shaped trend.</description>

      <title>Diffusion backbone of temporal higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal higher-order networks, where each hyperlink involving a group of nodes are activated or deactivated over time, are recently used to represent complex systems such as social contacts, interactions or collaborations that occur at specific times. Such networks are substrates for social contagion processes like the diffusion of information and opinions. In this work, we consider eight temporal higher-order networks derived from human face-to-face interactions in various contexts and the Susceptible-Infected threshold process on each of these networks: whenever a hyperlink is active and the number of infected nodes in the hyperlink exceeds a threshold $\Theta$, each susceptible node in the hyperlink is infected independently with probability $\beta$. The objective is to understand (1) the contribution of each hyperlink to the diffusion process, namely, the average number of nodes that are infected directly via the activation of the hyperlink when the diffusion starts from an arbitrary seed node, and (2) hyperlinks with what network properties tend to contribute more. We first propose to construct the diffusion backbone. The backbone is a weighted higher-order network, where the weight of each hyperlink denotes the contribution of the hyperlink to a given diffusion process. Secondly, we find that the backbone, or the contribution of hyperlinks, is dependent on the parameters $\beta$ and $\Theta$ of the diffusion process, which is also supported by our theoretical analysis of the backbone when $\beta\rightarrow 0$. Thirdly, we systematically design centrality metrics for hyperlinks in a temporal higher-order network, and each centrality metric is used to estimate the ranking of hyperlinks by the weight in the backbone. Finally, we find and explain why different centrality metrics can better estimate the contributions of hyperlinks for different parameters of the diffusion process.</description>

      <title>Policy-relevance of a Model Inter-comparison: Switzerland in the European Energy Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy transition is reshaping electricity systems, bringing new challenges, and emphasizing the need for strategic planning. Energy policies play a crucial role in guiding this transition. However, assessing their impacts often requires robust modeling involving multiple models and going beyond a single country's scope, analyzing international interactions. In this study, we examine three Swiss energy policies, analyzing their impacts on both the national energy system and the cross-border electricity flows. We use a model inter-comparison approach with four electricity system models to explore scenarios involving Swiss renewable generation targets, the Swiss market integration, and the Swiss winter import limitations, in the context of various European electricity developments. The results indicate that a renewable generation target leads to a reduction in net imports and electricity prices. Additionally, reduced market integration impacts both Swiss and European energy transitions by limiting trade benefits, underutilizing Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES), and increasing electricity supply costs. Lastly, we observe that limiting Swiss winter imports adversely affects electricity trading, driving up both supply costs and electricity prices.</description>

      <title>Universal Patterns in the Long-term Growth of Urban Infrastructure in U.S. Cities from 1900 to 2015</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of cities in the past century, our quantitative, in-depth understanding of how cities grow remains limited due to a consistent lack of historical data. Thus, the scaling laws between a city's features and its population as they evolve over time, known as temporal city scaling, is under-explored, especially for time periods spanning multiple decades. In this paper, we leverage novel data sources such as the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US), and analyze the temporal scaling laws of developed area, building indoor area, building footprint area, and road length and other road network statistics for nearly all metropolitan areas in the U.S. from 1900 to 2015. We find that scaling exponents vary dramatically between cities as a function of their size and location. Three notable patterns emerge. First, scaling law exponents imply many, but not all, metropolitan areas are becoming less dense and indoor area per capita increases as cities grow, in contrast to expectations. Second, larger cities tend to have a smaller scaling exponent than smaller cities. Third, scaling exponents (and growth patterns) are similar between nearby cities. These results show a long-term trend that could harm urban sustainability as previously dense populations are rapidly spreading out into undeveloped land. Moreover, the regional similarity of long-term urban growth patterns implies that city evolution and sustainability patterns are more interconnected than prior research has suggested. These results help urban planners and scientists understand universal, long-term patterns of city growth across the US.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for the distribution of first return times of non-backtracking random walks on configuration model networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the distribution of first return (FR) times of non-backtracking random walks (NBWs) on undirected configuration model networks consisting of $N$ nodes with degree distribution $P(k)$. We focus on the case in which the network consists of a single connected component. Starting from a random initial node $i$ at time $t=0$, an NBW hops into a random neighbor of $i$ at time $t=1$ and at each subsequent step it continues to hop into a random neighbor of its current node, excluding the previous node. We calculate the tail distribution $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ of first return times from a random node to itself. It is found that $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ is given by a discrete Laplace transform of the degree distribution $P(k)$. This result exemplifies the relation between structural properties of a network, captured by the degree distribution, and properties of dynamical processes taking place on the network. Using the tail-sum formula, we calculate the mean first return time ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$. Surprisingly, ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$ coincides with the result obtained from the Kac's lemma that applies to classical random walks (RWs). We also calculate the variance ${\rm Var}(T_{\rm FR})$, which accounts for the variability of first return times between different NBW trajectories. We apply this formalism to random regular graphs, Erdos-R\'enyi networks and configuration model networks with exponential and power-law degree distributions and obtain closed-form expressions for $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ as well as its mean and variance. These results provide useful insight on the advantages of NBWs over classical RWs in network exploration, sampling and search processes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Vulnerability of Zero-Carbon Power Grids under Climate-Technological Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to decarbonized energy systems has become a priority globally to mitigate carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, the vulnerabilities of zero-carbon power grids under climatic and technological changes have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we focus on modeling the zero-carbon grid using a dataset that captures diverse future climatic-technological scenarios, with New York State as a case study. By accurately representing the topology and operational constraints of the power grid, we identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity in vulnerabilities arising from the interplay of renewable resource availability, high load, and severe transmission line congestion. Our findings reveal a need for 61-105\% more firm, zero-emission capacity to ensure system reliability. Merely increasing wind and solar capacity is ineffective in improving reliability due to transmission congestion and spatiotemporal variations in vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of considering spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints when making decisions regarding additional investments in renewable resources.</description>

      <title>Job loss disrupts individuals' mobility and their exploratory patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, human mobility research has discovered universal patterns capable of describing how people move. These regularities have been shown to partly depend on individual and environmental characteristics (e.g., gender, rural/urban, country). In this work, we show that life-course events, such as job loss, can disrupt individual mobility patterns. Adversely affecting individuals' well-being and potentially increasing the risk of social and economic inequalities, we show that job loss drives a significant change in the exploratory behaviour of individuals with changes that intensify over time since job loss. Our findings shed light on the dynamics of employment-related behavior at scale, providing a deeper understanding of key components in human mobility regularities. These drivers can facilitate targeted social interventions to support the most vulnerable populations.</description>
