      <title>Weighted Group Search on the Disk &amp; Improved Lower Bounds for Priority Evacuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider \emph{weighted group search on a disk}, which is a search-type problem involving 2 mobile agents with unit-speed. The two agents start collocated and their goal is to reach a (hidden) target at an unknown location and a known distance of exactly 1 (i.e., the search domain is the unit disk). The agents operate in the so-called \emph{wireless} model that allows them instantaneous knowledge of each others findings. The termination cost of agents' trajectories is the worst-case \emph{arithmetic weighted average}, which we quantify by parameter $w$, of the times it takes each agent to reach the target, hence the name of the problem. Our work follows a long line of research in search and evacuation, but quite importantly it is a variation and extension of two well-studied problems, respectively. The known variant is the one in which the search domain is the line, and for which an optimal solution is known. Our problem is also the extension of the so-called \emph{priority evacuation}, which we obtain by setting the weight parameter $w$ to $0$. For the latter problem the best upper/lower bound gap known is significant. Our contributions for weighted group search on a disk are threefold. \textit{First}, we derive upper bounds for the entire spectrum of weighted averages $w$. Our algorithms are obtained as a adaptations of known techniques, however the analysis is much more technical. \textit{Second}, our main contribution is the derivation of lower bounds for all weighted averages. This follows from a \emph{novel framework} for proving lower bounds for combinatorial search problems based on linear programming and inspired by metric embedding relaxations. \textit{Third}, we apply our framework to the priority evacuation problem, improving the previously best lower bound known from $4.38962$ to $4.56798$, thus reducing the upper/lower bound gap from $0.42892$ to $0.25056$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Search-Type Problems on Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several advancements in search-type problems for fleets of mobile agents operating in two dimensions under the wireless model. Potential hidden target locations are equidistant from a central point, forming either a disk (infinite possible locations) or regular polygons (finite possible locations). Building on the foundational disk evacuation problem, the disk priority evacuation problem with $k$ Servants, and the disk $w$-weighted search problem, we make improvements on several fronts. First we establish new upper and lower bounds for the $n$-gon priority evacuation problem with $1$ Servant for $n \leq 13$, and for $n_k$-gons with $k=2, 3, 4$ Servants, where $n_2 \leq 11$, $n_3 \leq 9$, and $n_4 \leq 10$, offering tight or nearly tight bounds. The only previous results known were a tight upper bound for $k=1$ and $n=6$ and lower bounds for $k=1$ and $n \leq 9$. Second, our work improves the best lower bound known for the disk priority evacuation problem with $k=1$ Servant from $4.46798$ to $4.64666$ and for $k=2$ Servants from $3.6307$ to $3.65332$. Third, we improve the best lower bounds known for the disk $w$-weighted group search problem, significantly reducing the gap between the best upper and lower bounds for $w$ values where the gap was largest. These improvements are based on nearly tight upper and lower bounds for the $11$-gon and $12$-gon $w$-weighted evacuation problems, while previous analyses were limited only to lower bounds and only to $7$-gons.</description>

      <title>Dataless Quadratic Neural Networks for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) plays a crucial role in addressing various significant problems, among them the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. In light of recent advancements in deep learning methods, efforts have been directed towards leveraging data-driven learning approaches, typically rooted in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, to tackle the NP-hard MIS problem. However, these approaches rely on labeled datasets, exhibit weak generalization, and often depend on problem-specific heuristics. Recently, ReLU-based dataless neural networks were introduced to address combinatorial optimization problems. This paper introduces a novel dataless quadratic neural network formulation, featuring a continuous quadratic relaxation for the MIS problem. Notably, our method eliminates the need for training data by treating the given MIS instance as a trainable entity. More specifically, the graph structure and constraints of the MIS instance are used to define the structure and parameters of the neural network such that training it on a fixed input provides a solution to the problem, thereby setting it apart from traditional supervised or reinforcement learning approaches. By employing a gradient-based optimization algorithm like ADAM and leveraging an efficient off-the-shelf GPU parallel implementation, our straightforward yet effective approach demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Another significant advantage of our approach is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the running time of our method scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges.</description>

      <title>Almost Orthogonal Arrays: Theory and Search Three Ways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal arrays play a fundamental role in many applications. However, constructing orthogonal arrays with the required parameters for an application usually is extremely difficult and, sometimes, even impossible. Hence there is an increasing need for a relaxation of orthogonal arrays to allow a wider flexibility. The latter has lead to various types of arrays under the name of ``nearly-orthogonal arrays'', and less often ``almost orthogonal arrays''. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we review all the existing relaxations, comparing and discussing them in depth. On the other hand, we explore how to find almost orthogonal arrays three ways: using integer programming, local search meta-heuristics and algebraic methods. We compare all our search results with the ones existing in the literature, and we show that they are competitive, improving some of the existing arrays for many non-orthogonality measures. All our found almost orthogonal arrays are available at a public repository.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Complexity of Inversion of sequences and Local Inversion of Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Paper defines and explores solution to the problem of \emph{Inversion of a finite Sequence} over the binary field, that of finding a prefix element of the sequence which confirms with a \emph{Recurrence Relation} (RR) rule defined by a polynomial and satisfied by the sequence. The minimum number of variables (order) in a polynomial of a fixed degree defining RRs is termed as the \emph{Polynomial Complexity} of the sequence at that degree, while the minimum number of variables of such polynomials at a fixed degree which also result in a unique prefix to the sequence and maximum rank of the matrix of evaluation of its monomials, is called \emph{Polynomial Complexity of Inversion} at the chosen degree. Solutions of this problems discovers solutions to the problem of \emph{Local Inversion} of a map $F:\ftwo^n\rightarrow\ftwo^n$ at a point $y$ in $\ftwo^n$, that of solving for $x$ in $\ftwo^n$ from the equation $y=F(x)$. Local inversion of maps has important applications which provide value to this theory. In previous work it was shown that minimal order \emph{Linear Recurrence Relations} (LRR) satisfied by the sequence known as the \emph{Linear Complexity} (LC) of the sequence, gives a unique solution to the inversion when the sequence is a part of a periodic sequence. This paper explores extension of this theory for solving the inversion problem by considering \emph{Non-linear Recurrence Relations} defined by a polynomials of a fixed degree $&gt;1$ and satisfied by the sequence. The minimal order of polynomials satisfied by a sequence is well known as non-linear complexity (defining a Feedback Shift Register of smallest order which determines the sequences by RRs) and called as \emph{Maximal Order Complexity} (MOC) of the sequence. However unlike the LC there is no unique polynomial recurrence relation at any degree.</description>

      <title>The periodic structure of local consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect the mixing behaviour of random walks over a graph to the power of the local-consistency algorithm for the solution of the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). We extend this connection to arbitrary CSPs and their promise variant. In this way, we establish a linear-level (and, thus, optimal) lower bound against the local-consistency algorithm applied to the class of aperiodic promise CSPs. The proof is based on a combination of the probabilistic method for random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi hypergraphs and a structural result on the number of fibers (i.e., long chains of hyperedges) in sparse hypergraphs of large girth. As a corollary, we completely classify the power of local consistency for the approximate graph homomorphism problem by establishing that, in the nontrivial cases, the problem has linear width.</description>

      <title>Maximum Bipartite vs. Triangle-Free Subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a (multi)graph $G$ which contains a bipartite subgraph with $\rho$ edges, what is the largest triangle-free subgraph of $G$ that can be found efficiently? We present an SDP-based algorithm that finds one with at least $0.8823 \rho$ edges, thus improving on the subgraph with $0.878 \rho$ edges obtained by the classic Max-Cut algorithm of Goemans and Williamson. On the other hand, by a reduction from Hastad's 3-bit PCP we show that it is NP-hard to find a triangle-free subgraph with $(25 / 26 + \epsilon) \rho \approx (0.961 + \epsilon) \rho$ edges.
  As an application, we classify the Maximum Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem MaxPCSP($G$,$H$) for all bipartite $G$: Given an input (multi)graph $X$ which admits a $G$-colouring satisfying $\rho$ edges, find an $H$-colouring of $X$ that satisfies $\rho$ edges. This problem is solvable in polynomial time, apart from trivial cases, if $H$ contains a triangle, and is NP-hard otherwise.</description>

      <title>SAT and Lattice Reduction for Integer Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difficulty of factoring large integers into primes is the basis for cryptosystems such as RSA. Due to the widespread popularity of RSA, there have been many proposed attacks on the factorization problem such as side-channel attacks where some bits of the prime factors are available. When enough bits of the prime factors are known, two methods that are effective at solving the factorization problem are satisfiability (SAT) solvers and Coppersmith's method. The SAT approach reduces the factorization problem to a Boolean satisfiability problem, while Coppersmith's approach uses lattice basis reduction. Both methods have their advantages, but they also have their limitations: Coppersmith's method does not apply when the known bit positions are randomized, while SAT-based methods can take advantage of known bits in arbitrary locations, but have no knowledge of the algebraic structure exploited by Coppersmith's method. In this paper we describe a new hybrid SAT and computer algebra approach to efficiently solve random leaked-bit factorization problems. Specifically, Coppersmith's method is invoked by a SAT solver to determine whether a partial bit assignment can be extended to a complete assignment. Our hybrid implementation solves random leaked-bit factorization problems significantly faster than either a pure SAT or pure computer algebra approach.</description>

      <title>SHA-256 Collision Attack with Programmatic SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptographic hash functions play a crucial role in ensuring data security, generating fixed-length hashes from variable-length inputs. The hash function SHA-256 is trusted for data security due to its resilience after over twenty years of intense scrutiny. One of its critical properties is collision resistance, meaning that it is infeasible to find two different inputs with the same hash. Currently, the best SHA-256 collision attacks use differential cryptanalysis to find collisions in simplified versions of SHA-256 that are reduced to have fewer steps, making it feasible to find collisions.
  In this paper, we use a satisfiability (SAT) solver as a tool to search for step-reduced SHA-256 collisions, and dynamically guide the solver with the aid of a computer algebra system (CAS) used to detect inconsistencies and deduce information that the solver would otherwise not detect on its own. Our hybrid SAT + CAS solver significantly outperformed a pure SAT approach, enabling us to find collisions in step-reduced SHA-256 with significantly more steps. Using SAT + CAS, we find a 38-step collision of SHA-256 with a modified initialization vector -- something first found by a highly sophisticated search tool of Mendel, Nad, and Schl\"affer. Conversely, a pure SAT approach could find collisions for no more than 28 steps. However, our work only uses the SAT solver CaDiCaL and its programmatic interface IPASIR-UP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers investigating for which positive integers $m$ there exists a maximal antichain of size $m$ in the Boolean lattice $B_n$ (the power set of $[n]:=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, ordered by inclusion). In the first part, the sizes of maximal antichains have been characterized. Here we provide an alternative construction with the benefit of showing that almost all sizes of maximal antichains can be obtained using antichains containing only $l$-sets and $(l+1)$-sets for some $l$.</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities: Separating Random Order from Order Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04024v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. A gambler is sent values in an online fashion, sampled from an instance of independent distributions, in an adversarial, random or selected order, depending on the model. When observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  The model, in which the gambler selects the arrival order first, and then observes the values, is known as Order Selection. In this model a ratio of $0.7251$ is attainable for any instance. Recently, this has been improved up to $0.7258$ by Bubna and Chiplunkar (2023). If the gambler chooses the arrival order (uniformly) at random, we obtain the Random Order model. The worst case ratio over all possible instances has been extensively studied for at least $40$ years. Through simulations, Bubna and Chiplunkar (2023) also showed that this ratio is at most $0.7254$ for the Random Order model, thus establishing for the first time that carefully choosing the order, instead of simply taking it at random, benefits the gambler. We give an alternative, non-simulation-assisted proof of this fact, by showing mathematically that in the Random Order model, no algorithm can achieve a ratio larger than $0.7235$. This sets a new state-of-the-art hardness for this model, and establishes more formally that there is a real benefit in choosing the order.</description>

      <title>HBS Tilings Extended: State of the Art and Novel Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Penrose tilings are the most famous aperiodic tilings, and they have been studied extensively. In particular, patterns composed with hexagons (H), boats (B) and stars (S) were soon exhibited and many physicists published on what they later called HBS tilings, but no article or book combines all we know about them. This work is done here, before introducing new decorations and properties including explicit substitutions. For the latter, the star comes in three versions so we have 5 prototiles in what we call the Star tileset. Yet this set yields exactly the strict HBS tilings formed using 3 tiles decorated with either the usual decorations (arrows) or Ammann bar markings for instance. Another new tileset called Gemstones is also presented, derived from the Star tileset.</description>

      <title>Recurrence relations for the joint distribution of the sum and maximum of independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the joint distribution of the sum and maximum of independent, not necessarily identically distributed, nonnegative random variables is studied for two cases: i) continuous and ii) discrete random variables. First, a recursive formula of the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) is derived in both cases. Then, recurrence relations of the joint probability density function (PDF) and the joint probability mass function (PMF) are given in the former and the latter case, respectively. Interestingly, there is a fundamental difference between the joint PDF and PMF. The proofs are simple and mainly based on the following tools from calculus and discrete mathematics: differentiation under the integral sign (also known as Leibniz's integral rule), the law of total probability, and mathematical induction. In addition, this work generalizes previous results in the literature, and finally presents several extensions of the methodology.</description>

      <title>Geometric Thickness of Multigraphs is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a (multi)graph $G = (V,E)$ has geometric thickness $t$ if there exists a straight-line drawing $\varphi : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ and a $t$-coloring of its edges where no two edges sharing a point in their relative interior have the same color. The \textsc{Geometric Thickness} problem asks whether a given multigraph has geometric thickness at most $t$. This problem was shown to be NP-hard for $t=2$ [Durocher, Gethner, and Mondal, CG 2016]. In this paper, we settle the computational complexity of \textsc{Geometric Thickness} by showing that it is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete already for thickness $30$. Moreover, our reduction shows that the problem is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete for $4392$-planar graphs, where a graph is $k$-planar if it admits a topological drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In the course of our paper, we answer previous questions on geometric thickness and on other related problems, in particular that simultaneous graph embeddings of $31$ edge-disjoint graphs and pseudo-segment stretchability with chromatic number $30$ are $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete.</description>
