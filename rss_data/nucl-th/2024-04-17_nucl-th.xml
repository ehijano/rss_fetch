      <title>Prediction of Nuclear Charge Density Distribution with Feedback Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear charge density distribution plays an important role in nuclear physics and atomic physics. As one of the most frequently used models to obtain charge density distribution, the two-parameter fermi (2pF) model has been widely applied in both nuclear physics and atomic physics. Currently, the feedforward neural network has been employed to study the available 2pF model parameters for 86 nuclei, and it is found that by introducing A^{1/3} into the input parameter of the neural network, the accuracy and precision of the parameter learning effect are improved. Furthermore, the average result of multiple predictions is more reliable than the best result of a single prediction, and there is no significant difference between the average result of density value and of parameter value for the average charge density distribution. In addition, 2pF parameters of 284 (near) stable nuclei are also predicted in this work, which provides a reference for the experiment.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon stimulated grasers assisted by laser-plasma interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the possibility of achieving the stimulated amplification of $\gamma$-rays. Herein, our approach circumvents the so-called ``graser dilemma" through a non-linear, multi-photon mechanism. Our work foresees the combination of a high-intensity $\gamma-$flash generated by the interaction of a high-intensity laser pulse with plasma and intensive photons supplied by an additional laser. We show that multi-photon stimulated emission processes can have a larger effective cross-section compared to a one-photon process. The bandwidth of the supplied photons can also be tuned to curtail linewidth broadening. Naturally, Mossbauer transitions can be chosen to apply the scheme in the first instance. Furthermore, we derive that even multi-photon stimulated emission in the form of an anti-Stokes type could allow our scheme to be applied to non-Mossbauer nuclei, provided that the supplied photon energy can be tuned to compensate for the recoil and other broadening induced losses. The graser development can be spearheaded using multi-PW class high-power laser systems such as the 10 PW installation at Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) in Romania.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition in soft-wall AdS/QCD with scalar-dilaton coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral phase boundary of nuclear matter is expected to have a critical point where the rapid crossover of lattice methods at zero chemical potential becomes a first-order phase transition. Phenomenological models based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, known as AdS/ QCD, have succeeded in capturing many features of nuclear matter, with recent progress in producing the expected critical point. We study a model that produces a critical point in the chiral phase diagram by introducing a coupling between the scalar chiral field and the dilaton. We examine the effect of the scalar-dilaton coupling on the critical point. We also study the zero-temperature chiral dynamics, which must allow for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the limit of zero quark mass. We find that when the scalar-dilaton coupling is large enough to ensure correct zero-temperature chiral dynamics, a critical point is present only if the quark mass is greater than 12.8 MeV.</description>

      <title>Kaon production in HADES Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.4$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within an isospin- and momentum-dependent transport model by including the kaon production, we study the kaon prodution in heavy-ion collisions (HICs) at SIS (Darmstadt Schwerionen Synchrotron, GSI) energies. Based on simulations of a centrality of 0-40\% Au + Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV, a typical reaction that has been carried out by the HADES Collaborator, we find that the medium modification of kaon masses plays a vital role in studying the kaon productions in HICs, and is also unavoidable for the successful interpretation of the HADES data on kaon rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra. Moreover, we also find that the kaon transverse and directed flows are affected significantly by both the kaon potential or dispersion relation and medium modification of kaon masses, and thus could be used in HICs as the sensitive probes to detect the kaon potential or dispersion relation as well as the medium modification of kaon masses.</description>

      <title>Kaon Structure in the Nuclear Medium within the Light Front Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the charged kaon in symmetric nuclear matter using a Bethe-Salpeter amplitude to model the quark-anti-quark bound state, which is well constrained by previous studies of its vacuum properties. The electromagnetic form factor, charge radius, decay constant and the light-front valence component probability are investigated in symmetric nuclear matter. In order to describe the constituent up and anti-strange quarks in nuclear matter, we adopt the ``quark-meson coupling (QMC) model", which has been widely applied to various hadronic and nuclear phenomena in the nuclear medium.</description>

      <title>Energy dependent nuclear suppression from gluon saturation in exclusive vector meson production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the exclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ photoproduction cross section at high energies from the Color Glass Condensate approach. The results are compared to the center-of-mass energy dependent $\gamma+A\to\mathrm{J}/\psi+A$ cross sections extracted from measurements in ultra peripheral heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. We predict strong saturation-driven nuclear suppression at high energies, while LHC data prefers even stronger suppression. We explore the effect of nucleon shape fluctuations on the nuclear suppression in the coherent and incoherent cross sections, and show that the most recent measurement of the $|t|$-differential incoherent $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ cross section prefers large event-by-event fluctuations of the nucleon substructure in heavy nuclei, comparable to that found for a free proton.</description>

      <title>Ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a promising approach for solving the real-time dynamics of systems consist of quarks and gluons from first-principle calculations that are intractable with classical computers. In this work, we start with an initial problem of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering and present an efficient and precise approach to quantum simulate the dynamics on the light front. This approach employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements the compact scheme for basis encoding. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input scheme that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. It utilizes the truncated Taylor series for the dynamics simulations. The qubit cost of our approach scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our approach advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our approach with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>
