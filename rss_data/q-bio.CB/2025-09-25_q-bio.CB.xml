      <title>An energy-based mathematical model of actin-driven protrusions in eukaryotic chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In eukaryotic cell chemotaxis, cells extend and retract transient actin-driven protrusions at their membrane that facilitate both the detection of external chemical gradients and directional movement via the formation of focal adhesions with the extracellular matrix. Although extensive experimental work has detailed how cellular protrusions and morphology vary under different environmental conditions, the mechanistic principles linking protrusive activity to these factors remain poorly understood. Here, we model the extension of actin-based protrusions in chemotaxis as an optimisation problem, wherein cells balance the detection of chemical gradients with the energetic cost of protrusion formation. Our model, built on the assumption of energy minimisation, provides a framework that successfully reproduces experimentally observed patterns of protrusive activity across a range of biological systems and environmental conditions, suggesting that energetic efficiency may underpin the morphology and chemotactic behaviour of motile eukaryotic cells. Additionally, we leverage the model to generate novel predictions regarding cellular responses to other, experimentally untested environmental perturbations, providing testable hypotheses for future experimental work that may be used to validate and refine the model presented here.</description>

      <title>Integrating Mechanistic Modeling and Machine Learning to Study CD4+/CD8+ CAR-T Cell Dynamics with Tumor Antigen Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, yet patient responses remain highly variable and the roles of CD4 and CD8 subsets are not fully understood. We present an extended mathematical framework of CAR-T cell dynamics that explicitly models CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic lineages and their interactions with tumor antigen burden. Building on the Kirouac et al. (2023) model of antigen-regulated memory, effector, and exhaustion transitions, our system of differential equations incorporates cytokine-mediated modulation of CD8 proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory regeneration by CD4 T cells. Sensitivity analyses identify effector proliferation burst size, antigen turnover, and CD8 expansion rates as dominant determinants of treatment outcome. Virtual patient simulations reproduce clinical findings that a 1:1 CD4:CD8 ratio enhances CAR-T expansion and tumor clearance relative to CD8-only products. Finally, we integrate a feed-forward neural network trained on noisy virtual patient data to improve predictive robustness, and apply SHAP analysis to interpret the network predictions and compare them with mechanistic sensitivity analyses. This work highlights the synergistic roles of CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cells and provides a quantitative foundation for optimizing treatments and patient stratification.</description>
