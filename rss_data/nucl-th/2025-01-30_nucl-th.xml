      <title>Relativistic chiral nuclear forces: status and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear structure, reactions, and the properties of neutron stars from \textit{ab initio} calculations from the nucleon degrees of freedom has always been a primary goal of nuclear physics, in which the microscopic nuclear force serves as the fundamental input. So far, the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, first proposed by the Nobel laureate Weinberg, has become the \textit{de facto} standard input for nuclear \textit{ab initio} studies. However, compared to their non-relativistic counterparts, relativistic \textit{ab initio} calculations, which describe better nuclear observables, have only begun. The lack of modern relativistic nucleon-nucleon interactions is an important issue restricting their development. In this work, we briefly review the development and status of the Weinberg chiral nuclear force, as well as its limitations. We further present a concise introduction to the relativistic chiral nuclear force, show its description of the scattering phase shifts and observables such as differential cross sections, and demonstrate its unique features. Additionally, we show that the relativistic framework could be naturally extended to the antinucleon-nucleon interaction.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole response of sd-shell nuclei within the Configuration-Interaction Shell Model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable theoretical predictions of nuclear dipole excitations are crucial for various nuclear applications, particularly in nuclear astrophysics. Calculations of radiative capture cross sections often rely on theoretical gamma strength functions, with the electric dipole response being the dominant component. We aim at a systematic description of the E1 strength of nuclei with mass numbers between 17 and 40 of interest for various applications and to better understand the nature of the low-energy dipole strength in neutron-rich nuclei, known as pygmy dipole resonances. We use the Configuration Interaction shell-model framework in the p-sd-pf valence space with a previously established empirical Hamiltonian. Systematic results of photoabsorption strength show good agreement with experimental data, provided a renormalization of the dipole operator is applied. Transition densities are computed in 26Ne and confirm the pure isovector character of the Giant Dipole Resonance. The strength at 7-10MeV is shown to have a distinct structure with largely fragmented wave functions and transition densities of isovector character at the edge of the nucleus. The Configuration Interaction shell model is proved to be a valuable tool in the description of the photoresponse of light nuclei, providing more accurate results than the usually employed approaches.</description>

      <title>Zubarev response approach to polarization phenomena in local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the expansion of Zubarev's density operator, we develop a linear response approach to study various spin physics in a locally equilibrated medium, particularly focusing on various polarization phenomena in heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we connect familiar correlation functions and diagrammatic methods to the Zubarev formalism, enabling the use of established techniques like the Matsubara/imaginary time formalism to facilitate calculations. For a spin-1/2 particle, we re-derive its vector polarization using this Zubarev response approach, which exactly reproduces with our previous results based on Luttinger's method. For a spin-1 particle, we calculate the vector polarization and find the expected contributions from vorticity, temperature gradients, and shear, which are identical to those for spin-1/2 particles except for a factor of 4/3 as expected. For the tensor polarization and spin alignment of a spin-1 boson, we explicitly prove that the non-dissipative contribution is zero at leading order in gradients, and briefly reiterate our previous findings for the dissipative contribution with further discussions on several concerns. Additionally, we discuss several relevant subtleties and questions, including an alternative derivation for Zubarev response approach, the covariance issues of different spin density matrix definitions, a further explanation of slow and fast modes, the mode selection scheme, etc. We also discuss skeleton expansions, higher-order contributions, and non-perturbative methods, particularly their potential connection to lattice field theory. In summary, this work discusses the foundations and subtleties of Zubarev response approach, with specific examples from spin physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$(1405) in the flavor SU(3) limit using a separable potential in the HAL QCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the HAL QCD method, we investigate S-wave meson-baryon interactions in singlet and two octet channels in the flavor SU(3) limit, where the chiral unitary model predicts that a combination of bound-state poles in these channels corresponds to $\Lambda(1405)$. To avoid the singular behavior of the leading-order potentials of these channels in the derivative expansion, we instead employ a separable potential in the time-dependent HAL QCD method. To calculate all-to-all propagators in the three-point correlation functions including $\Lambda$-baryon source operators with zero momentum, we employ the conventional stochastic estimation combined with the covariant approximation averaging. Separable potentials both in the singlet and octet channels show attraction without singular behavior. Our results of the corresponding phase shifts indicate that the attractive interaction in the singlet channel is stronger than that in the octet. Binding energies are consistent with the estimates from the two-point correlation function within one (two) sigma for the singlet (octet) channel, and this ordering of binding energies is consistent with the mass hierarchy suggested by the chiral unitary model.</description>

      <title>Charge diffusion in second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores charge diffusion in relativistic hydrodynamics using kinetic theory with a modified collision kernel that incorporates the momentum dependence of the particle relaxation time. Starting from the Boltzmann equation within the extended relaxation time approximation (ERTA), we derive second-order evolution equations for the dissipative charge current and calculate the associated transport coefficients. The sensitivity of transport coefficients to the particle momentum dependence of the collision time scale of the microscopic interactions in the hot QCD medium is analyzed. For a conformal charge-conserved system, we compare the ERTA-modified transport coefficients for particle diffusion with exact results derived from scalar field theory. With an appropriate parameterization of the relaxation time, we demonstrate the consistency of our analysis and assess the degree of agreement of the results with the exact solutions. The relaxation times for the shear and number diffusion modes are seen to be distinct in general when the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Empirical Formula for Two-Neutrino Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a semi-empirical formula (SEF) for calculating the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for two-neutrino double-beta decay. The SEF's dependence on the proton and neutron numbers, the pairing, isospin, and deformation properties of the initial and final nuclei is inspired by the insights offered by nuclear many-body methods and trends in experimental data. Compared with the previous phenomenological and nuclear models, the SEF yields the best agreement with the experimental NMEs. Its stability and predictive power are cross-validated, and predictions are provided for nuclear systems of experimental interest.</description>

      <title>Exploring Particle Production and Thermal-Like Behavior through Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown a potential correlation between the entanglement of initial state partons in elementary particle collisions, as conceptualized by contemporary quantum and particle theory, and the final state multiplicity distribution of hadrons produced in experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It has been proposed that this relation between states can be demonstrated in a measurement of entropy. By showing equality between entanglement entropy in the initial state and thermodynamic entropy in the final state, we hope to demonstrate that not only is entanglement the driving mechanism behind matter generation, but also the thermal-like behavior seen in high energy particle collisions.</description>

      <title>Decay spectroscopy of heavy and superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After more than half a century after the first predictions of the so-called "island of stability of superheavy nuclei", exploring the limits of nuclear stability at highest atomic numbers is still one of the most prominent challenges in low-energy nuclear physics. These exotic nuclear species reveal their character and details of some of their properties by their induced or spontaneous disintegration. The achievements in the field superheavy nuclei (SHN) research have been reported in a number of review papers throughout the decades. This review is an attempt to summarize the progress that has been made in recent years by employing the versatile tool park of Decay Spectroscopy After Separation (DSAS) for the heaviest isotopes from Z=99 (einsteinium) to Z=118 (oganesson). In addition, references to earlier reviews and the relevant papers, together with the major decay properties of all these isotopes are given.</description>
