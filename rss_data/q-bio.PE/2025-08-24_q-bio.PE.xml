      <title>Interplay between intraspecific suppression and environment in shaping biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that sustain high biodiversity remains a central challenge. MacArthur's classical consumer-resource model (MCRM) suggests that consumer diversity is limited by the number of available resources, yet empirical observations often exceed this bound. To address this, we extend the generalized consumer-resource model by incorporating intraspecific suppression and analyze its effects using the dynamical mean-field theory. Our results show that intraspecific suppression promotes biodiversity by preventing the emergence of dominant species and enabling more species to coexist, particularly in resource-rich environments. Furthermore, our results provide analytical bounds on relative diversity, demonstrating that the number of coexisting consumer species can exceed the number of resource kinds. This highlights the critical role of intraspecific suppression and environmental factors in promoting coexistence.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion and Emergent Universality in Coupled Memory-Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how simple local interactions give rise to emergent exploration patterns is a fundamental question in statistical physics. We introduce a minimal model of two coupled agents that avoid retracing their own paths while being attracted to the trails left by one another. This system is inspired by, but not limited to, pheromone-guided insect navigation. The coupling of self-avoidance and attraction generates rich emergent behavior, including distinct anomalous diffusion regimes, non-Gaussian position distributions, and compressed exponential encounter statistics. Most notably, we identify new universality classes for coupled random walks, characterized by unique scaling laws and distributional properties that, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of coupled stochastic processes with memory and interaction feedback, providing a framework for exploring transport phenomena in a broad range of multi-agent systems beyond biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. It is known that environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>
