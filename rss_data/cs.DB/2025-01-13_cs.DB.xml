      <title>An experimental comparison of tree-data structures for connectivity queries on fully-dynamic undirected graphs (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the past decades significant efforts have been made to propose data structures for answering connectivity queries on fully dynamic graphs, i.e., graphs with frequent insertions and deletions of edges. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these data structures perform in practice is missing, since not all of them have been implemented, let alone evaluated experimentally. We provide reference implementations for the proposed data structures and experimentally evaluate them on a wide range of graphs. Our findings show that the current solutions are not ready to be deployed in systems as is, as every data structure has critical weaknesses when used in practice. Key limitations that must be overcome are the space and time overhead incurred by balanced data structures, the degeneration of the runtime of space-efficient data structures in worst case scenarios, and the maintenance costs for balanced data structures. We detail our findings in the experimental evaluation and provide recommendations for implementing robust solutions for answering connectivity queries on dynamic graphs.</description>

      <title>Partition Constraints for Conjunctive Queries: Bounds and Worst-Case Optimal Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, various works have used statistics on relations to improve both the theory and practice of conjunctive query execution. Starting with the AGM bound which took advantage of relation sizes, later works incorporated statistics like functional dependencies and degree constraints. Each new statistic prompted work along two lines; bounding the size of conjunctive query outputs and worst-case optimal join algorithms. In this work, we continue in this vein by introducing a new statistic called a \emph{partition constraint}. This statistic captures latent structure within relations by partitioning them into sub-relations which each have much tighter degree constraints. We show that this approach can both refine existing cardinality bounds and improve existing worst-case optimal join algorithms.</description>
