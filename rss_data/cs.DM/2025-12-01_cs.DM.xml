      <title>On the structure of ($4K_1$, $C_4$, $P_6$)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the complexity of colouring ($4K_1, C_4$)-free graph is a long open problem. Recently Penev showed that there is a polynomial-time algorithm to colour a ($4K_1, C_4, C_6$)-free graph. In this paper, we will prove that if $G$ is a ($4K_1, C_4, P_6$)-free graph that contains a $C_6$, then $G$ has bounded clique-width. To this purpose, we use a new method to bound the clique-width, that is of independent interest. As a consequence, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to colour ($4K_1, C_4, P_6$)-free graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Incompressibility of Truth With Application to Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of Circuit Complexity and the nature of efficient computation from a new perspective. We present a framework for understanding Circuit Complexity through the lens of Information Theory with analogies to results in Kolmogorov Complexity, viewing circuits as descriptions of truth tables, encoded in logical gates and wires, rather than purely computational devices. From this framework, we re-prove some existing strong Circuit Complexity bounds, explain what the optimal circuits for most Boolean functions look like structurally, give insight into new circuit bounds, and explain the aforementioned results in a unifying intuition that re-frames time entirely.</description>

      <title>Mis\`ere Partizan Arc Kayles is PSPACE-complete, even on Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Mis\`ere Partizan Arc Kayles is PSPACE-complete on planar graphs via a reduction from Bounded Two-Player Constraint Logic. Furthermore, we show how to embed our gadgets onto the square and triangular grids. In order to clearly explain these results, we get into the details of Bounded Two-Player Constraint Logic and find three PSPACE-complete variants of that as well.</description>

      <title>Identifying all snarls and superbubbles in linear-time, via a unified SPQR-tree framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snarls and superbubbles are fundamental pangenome decompositions capturing variant sites. These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers.
  We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently.
  We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls. When computing superbubbles, we are up to 50 times faster than BubbleGun. Our SPQR tree framework provides a unifying perspective on bubble-like structures in pangenomics, together with a template for finding other bubble-like structures efficiently.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree-Decompositions with Bags of Bounded Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that several natural graph classes have tree-decompositions with minimum width such that each bag has bounded treewidth. For example, every planar graph has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth at most 3. This treewidth bound is best possible. More generally, every graph of Euler genus $g$ has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth in $O(g)$. This treewidth bound is best possible. Most generally, every $K_p$-minor-free graph has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth at most some polynomial function $f(p)$.
  In such results, the assumption of an excluded minor is justified, since we show that analogous results do not hold for the class of 1-planar graphs, which is one of the simplest non-minor-closed monotone classes. In fact, we show that 1-planar graphs do not have tree-decompositions with width within an additive constant of optimal, and with bags of bounded treewidth. On the other hand, we show that 1-planar $n$-vertex graphs have tree-decompositions with width $O(\sqrt{n})$ (which is the asymptotically tight bound) and with bounded treewidth bags. Moreover, this result holds in the more general setting of bounded layered treewidth, where the union of a bounded number of bags has bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Local Equivalences of Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph states form a large family of quantum states that are in one-to-one correspondence with mathematical graphs. Graph states are used in many applications, such as measurement-based quantum computation, as multipartite entangled resources. It is thus crucial to understand when two such states have the same entanglement, i.e. when they can be transformed into each other using only local operations. In this case, we say that the graph states are LU-equivalent (local unitary). If the local operations are restricted to the so-called Clifford group, we say that the graph states are LC-equivalent (local Clifford). Interestingly, a simple graph rule called local complementation fully captures LC-equivalence, in the sense that two graph states are LC-equivalent if and only if the underlying graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations. While it was once conjectured that two LU-equivalent graph states are always LC-equivalent, counterexamples do exist and local complementation fails to fully capture the entanglement of graph states. We introduce in this thesis a generalization of local complementation that does fully capture LU-equivalence. Using this characterization, we prove the existence of an infinite strict hierarchy of local equivalences between LC- and LU-equivalence. This also leads to the design of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two graph states are LU-equivalent, and to a proof that two LU-equivalent graph states are LC-equivalent if they are defined on at most 19 qubits. Furthermore, we study graph states that are universal in the sense that any smaller graph state, defined on any small enough set of qubits, can be induced using only local operations. We provide bounds and an optimal, probabilistic construction.</description>

      <title>Conditionals Based on Selection Functions, Modal Operators and Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for probability updating, of which Bayesian conditionalization is the most well-known and widely used, are modeling tools that aim to represent the process of modifying an initial epistemic state, typically represented by a prior probability function P, which is adjusted in light of new information. Notably, updating methods and conditional sentences seem to intuitively share a deep connection, as is evident in the case of conditionalization. The present work contributes to this line of research and aims at shedding new light on the relationship between updating methods and conditional connectives. Departing from previous literature that often focused on a specific type of conditional or a particular updating method, our goal is to prove general results concerning the connection between conditionals and their probabilities. This will allow us to characterize the probabilities of certain conditional connectives and to understand what class of updating procedures can be represented using specific conditional connectives. Broadly, we adopt a general perspective that encompasses a large class of conditionals and a wide range of updating methods, enabling us to prove some general results concerning their interrelation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture of Wills and Cusick states that if $k+1$ runners start running at distinct constant speeds around a unit-length circular track, then for each runner there is a time when he/she is at least $1/(k+1)$ away from all other runners. Rosenfeld recently obtained a computer-assisted proof of the conjecture for $8$ runners. By refining his approach with a sieve, we obtain proofs (also computer-assisted) for $9$ and $10$ runners.</description>

      <title>List-Decodable Regression via Expander Sketching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an expander-sketching framework for list-decodable linear regression that achieves sample complexity $\tilde{O}((d+\log(1/\delta))/\alpha)$, list size $O(1/\alpha)$, and near input-sparsity running time $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(X)+d^{3}/\alpha)$ under standard sub-Gaussian assumptions. Our method uses lossless expanders to synthesize lightly contaminated batches, enabling robust aggregation and a short spectral filtering stage that matches the best known efficient guarantees while avoiding SoS machinery and explicit batch structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22588v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branching Rauzy induction is a two-sided form of Rauzy induction that acts on regular interval exchange transformations (IETs). We introduce an extended form of branching Rauzy induction that applies to arbitrary standard IETs, including non-minimal ones. The procedure generalizes the branching Rauzy method with two induction steps, merging and splitting, to handle equal-length cuts and invariant components respectively. As an application, we show, via a stepwise morphic argument, that all return words in the language of an arbitrary IET cluster in the Burrows-Wheeler sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine ordered graphs, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, from the perspective of homomorphisms (and colorings) and their complexities. We demonstrate the corresponding computational and parameterized complexities, along with algorithms associated with related problems. These questions are interesting, and we show that numerous problems lead to various complexities. The reduction from homomorphisms of unordered structures to homomorphisms of ordered graphs is proved, achieved with the use of ordered bipartite graphs. We then determine the NP-completeness of the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms of ordered graphs and the XP and W[1]-hard nature of this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph. Classes of ordered graphs for which this problem can be solved in polynomial time are also presented.</description>

      <title>On Computational Aspects of Ordered Matching Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered matchings, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, where each vertex is connected to exactly one edge, play a crucial role in the area of ordered graphs and their homomorphisms. Therefore, we consider related problems from the complexity point of view and determine their corresponding computational and parameterized complexities. We show that the subgraph of ordered matchings problem is NP-complete and we prove that the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms between ordered matchings is NP-complete as well, implying NP-completeness of more generic problems. In parameterized complexity setting, we consider a natural choice of parameter - a number of vertices of the image ordered graph. We show that in contrast to the complexity context, finding homomorphisms if the image ordered graph is an ordered matching, this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph is FPT, which is known to be W[1]-hard for the general problem. We also determine that the problem of core for ordered matchings is solvable in polynomial time which is again in contrast to the NP-completeness of the general problem. We provide several algorithms and generalize some of these problems into ordered graphs with colored edges.</description>

      <title>On Computational Aspects of Cores of Ordered Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ordered graph is a graph enhanced with a linear order on the vertex set. An ordered graph is a core if it does not have an order-preserving homomorphism to a proper subgraph. We say that $H$ is the core of $G$ if (i) $H$ is a core, (ii) $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, and (iii) $G$ admits an order-preserving homomorphism to $H$. We study complexity aspects of several problems related to the cores of ordered graphs. Interestingly, they exhibit a different behavior than their unordered counterparts. We show that the retraction problem, i.e., deciding whether a given graph admits an ordered-preserving homomorphism to its specific subgraph, can be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, it is \NP-hard to decide whether a given ordered graph is a core. In fact, we show that it is even \NP-hard to distinguish graphs $G$ whose core is largest possible (i.e., if $G$ is a core) from those, whose core is the smallest possible, i.e., its size is equal to the ordered chromatic number of $G$. The problem is even \wone-hard with respect to the latter parameter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Gerver-Ramsey collinearity problem of determining the maximum number of points in a north-east lattice path without $k$ collinear points. Using a satisfiability solver, up to isomorphism we enumerate all north-east lattice paths avoiding $k$ collinear points for $k \leq 6$. We also find a north-east lattice path avoiding $k = 7$ collinear points with 327 steps, improving on the previous best length of 260 steps found by Shallit.</description>

      <title>Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treewidth is an important structural graph parameter that quantifies how closely a graph resembles a tree-like structure. It has applications in many algorithmic and combinatorial problems. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs, that is, graphs admitting a convex drawing (a straight-line drawing where all vertices lie on a circle) in which every edge crosses at most $k$ other edges. We also consider the more general class of outer min-$k$-planar graphs, which are graphs admitting a convex drawing where for every crossing of two edges at least one of these edges is crossed at most $k$ times.
  Firman, Gutowski, Kryven, Okada and Wolff [GD 2024] proved that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $1.5k+2$ and provided a lower bound of $k+2$ for even $k$. We establish a lower bound of $1.5k+0.5$ for every odd $k$. Additionally, they showed that every outer min-$k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k+1$. We improve this upper bound to $3 \cdot \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+4$.
  Our approach also allows us to upper bound the separation number, a parameter closely related to treewidth, of outer min-$k$-planar graphs by $2 \cdot \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+4$. This improves upon the previous bound of $2k+1$ and achieves a bound with an optimal multiplicative constant.</description>

      <title>Integer Representations in IEEE 754, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics</title>

Abstract: Although not primarily designed for this purpose, floating-point numbers are often used to represent integral values, with some applications explicitly relying on this capability. However, the integral representation properties of IEEE 754 floating-point numbers have not yet been formally investigated. Recently, the bfloat16, posit and takum machine number formats have been proposed as alternatives to IEEE 754, while OCP 8-bit floating point (OFP8) types (E4M3 and E5M2) have been introduced as 8-bit extensions of IEEE 754, albeit with slight deviations from the standard. It is therefore timely to evaluate IEEE 754 and to assess how effectively the new formats fulfil this function in comparison with the standard they aim to replace.
  This paper presents the first rigorous derivations and proofs of the integral representation capabilities of IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, OFP8, bfloat16, posits, and takums. We examine both the exact number of bits required to represent a given integer and the largest consecutive integer representable with a specified bit width. The results show that OFP8 yields mixed outcomes, bfloat16 generally underperforms, and posits fail to scale effectively, whereas takums consistently match or outperform the other formats, maintaining backward compatibility with IEEE 754.</description>

      <title>Subspace State Transfer in Coined Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a transport phenomenon in certain coined quantum walks where a subspace of states localized at a vertex gets transferred to another vertex. We first develop characterizations for perfect and pretty good subspace state transfer using the spectral properties of a Hermitian weighted digraph obtained from the underlying graph. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm that tests whether pointwise perfect subspace state transfer occurs at an integer step, given that the subspace and coins are rational. Finally, we construct several infinite families of examples that admit pointwise perfect $d$-dimensional subspace state transfer where $d\ge 2$.</description>
