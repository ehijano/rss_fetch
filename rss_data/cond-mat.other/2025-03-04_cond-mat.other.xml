      <title>Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories: absolute and relational</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum field theoretic many-body Green's function approach to solve the Coulomb many-body problem. The earlier beyond Born-Oppenheimer Green's function theories are absolute in nature and are based on the non-reduced Hamiltonian. Motivated by the issues following this approach we have developed a reduced Green's function theory which is relational in nature. The central differences between these approaches trace back to the relational-absolute debate, which has continued for over two thousand years since the time of Aristotle and still persists today. We highlight that these aspects of the theories are connected to several areas of modern physics, including relational quantum mechanics, quantum reference frames, superselection rules, the separation of different types of motion and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The starting point of any such exact theory must be absolute, given that the global conservation laws hold. However, for the observables to be meaningful, they must be defined with respect to the relative space. Approximations, such as the one introduced by Born and Oppenheimer, can break global symmetries and make certain parts of the absolute description well-defined. We highlight that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not necessary to explain the existence of solids, but entities such as phonons can be naturally explained within the relational theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of single Au nanoparticles on graphene simultaneously in real- and diffraction space by time-series convergent beam electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) on two-dimensional materials allows simultaneous recording of the real-space image (tens of nanometers in size) and diffraction pattern of the same sample in one single-shot intensity measurement. In this study, we employ time-series CBED to visualize single Au nanoparticles deposited on graphene. The real-space image of the probed region, with the amount, size, and positions of single Au nanoparticles, is directly observed in the zero-order CBED disk, while the atomic arrangement of the Au nanoparticles is available from the intensity distributions in the higher-order CBED disks. From the time-series CBED patterns, the movement of a single Au nanoparticle with rotation up to 4{\deg} was recorded. We also observed facet diffraction lines - intense bright lines formed between the CBED disks of the Au nanoparticle, which we explain by diffraction at the Au nanoparticle's facets. This work showcases CBED as a useful technique for studying adsorbates on graphene using Au nanoparticles as a model platform, and paves the way for future studies of different objects deposited on graphene.</description>

      <title>Time-Irreversible Quantum-Classical Dynamics of Molecular Models in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript aims to illustrate a quantum-classical dissipative theory (suited to be converted to effective algorithms for numerical simulations) within the long-term project of studying molecular processes in the brain. Other approaches, briefly sketched in the text, have advocated the need to deal with both quantum and classical dynamic variables when studying the brain. At variance with these other frameworks, the manuscript's formalism allows us to explicitly treat the classical dynamical variables. The theory must be dissipative not because of formal requirements but because brain processes appear to be dissipative at the molecular, physiological, and high functional levels. We discuss theoretically that using Brownian dynamics or the Nos\`e-Hoover-Chain thermostat to perform computer simulations provides an effective way to introduce an arrow of time for open quantum systems in a classical environment. In the future, We plan to study classical models of neurons and astrocytes, as well as their networks, coupled to quantum dynamical variables describing, e.g., nuclear and electron spins, HOMO and LUMO orbitals of phenyl and indole rings, ion channels, and tunneling protons.</description>

      <title>Current-driven collective control of helical spin texture in van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical control of quantum magnetic states is essential in spintronic science. Initial studies on the ferromagnetic state control were extended to collinear antiferromagnets and, more recently, noncollinear antiferromagnets. However, electrical control mechanisms of such exotic magnetic states remain poorly understood. Here, we report the first experimental and theoretical example of the current control of helical antiferromagnets, arising from the competition between collinear antiferromagnetic exchange and interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in new van-der-Waals (vdW) material Ni1/3NbS2. Due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry, an in-plane current generates spin-orbit torque that, in turn, interacts directly with the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our theoretical analyses indicate that a weak ferromagnetic order coexists due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, mediating the spin-orbit torque to collectively rotate the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our Ni1/3NbS2 nanodevice experiments produce current-dependent resistance change consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work widens our understanding of the electrical control of helical antiferromagnets and promotes vdW quantum magnets as interesting material platforms for electrical control.</description>

      <title>Characterizing dynamical behaviors in topological open systems with boundary dissipations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with boundary dissipations described by Lindblad master equations and unravel distinct dynamical features in the topologically different phases of the underlying Hamiltonian. By examining the long-time damping dynamics, we uncover a dynamical duality phenomenon between the weak and strong dissipation region, which exists only in the topologically non-trivial phase, linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectra,particularly the stripe closest to the steady state. When dissipation is confined to a single boundary, the dynamical duality phenomenon still exists. Under this condition, the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential size scaling relation in the topologically non-trivial phase and a power-law size scaling relation in the topologically trivial phase. Within the topologically non-trivial region, we identify the existence of boundary-localized dark states in the thermodynamical limit, which is responsible for the exponential size decay of Liouvillian gap.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fasteners on the Radar Cross-Section performance of Radar Absorbing Air Intake Duct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An aircraft consists of various cavities including air intake ducts, cockpit, radome, inlet and exhaust of heat exchangers, passage for engine bay/other bay cooling etc. These cavities are prime radar cross-section (RCS) contributors of aircraft. The major such cavity is air intake duct, and it contributes significantly to frontal sector RCS of an aircraft. The RCS reductions of air intake duct is very important to achieve a low RCS (or stealthy) aircraft configuration. In general, radar absorbing materials (RAM) are getting utilized for RCS reduction of air intake duct. It can also be noticed that a large number of fasteners are used for integration of air intake duct with the aircraft structures. The installation of fasteners on RAS may lead to degradation of RCS performance of air intake. However, no such studies are reported in the literature on the impact of rivets on the RCS performance of RAS air intake duct. In this paper, radar absorbing material of thickness 6.25 mm is designed which givens more than -10 dB reflection loss from 4 to 18GHz of frequencies. Next, the effect of rivet installation on these RAS is carried out using three different rivet configurations. The RCS performance of RAS is evaluated for duct of different lengths from 1 to 18GHz of frequencies. In order to see the RCS performance, five different air intake cases are considered The RCS performance with increase in percentage surface area of rivet heads to RAS is reported in detail. At the last, an open-source aircraft CAD model is considered and the RCS performance of RAS air intake with and without rivets is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>
