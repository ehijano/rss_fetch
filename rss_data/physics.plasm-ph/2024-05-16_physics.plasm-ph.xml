      <title>Advanced surrogate model for electron-scale turbulence in tokamak pedestals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an advanced surrogate model for predicting turbulent transport in the edge of tokamaks driven by electron temperature gradient (ETG) modes. Our derivation is based on a recently developed sensitivity-driven sparse grid interpolation approach for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis at scale, which informs the set of parameters that define the surrogate model as a scaling law. Our model reveals that ETG-driven electron heat flux is influenced by the safety factor $q$, electron beta $\beta_e$, and normalized electron Debye length $\lambda_D$, in addition to well established parameters such as the electron temperature and density gradients. To assess the trustworthiness of our model's predictions beyond training, we compute prediction intervals using bootstrapping. The surrogate model's predictive power is tested across a wide range of parameter values, including within-distribution testing parameters (to verify our model) as well as out-of-bounds and out-of-distribution testing (to validate the proposed model). Overall, validation efforts show that our model competes well with, or even outperforms, existing scaling laws in predicting ETG-driven transport.</description>

      <title>Water Purification Via Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water purification via plasma is considered a healthy, effective alternative to traditional water purification systems due to the lack of harmful chemical additives that traditional purification systems use. A reactor capable of eliminating bacteria colonies from contaminated water using plasma discharge was designed and tested. Materials and reactor parameters are discussed in this paper. It was confirmed that glow discharge plasma in water creates oxidants, eliminating bacteria colonies.</description>

      <title>Plasma Effects on Resonant Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of autoionizing resonances in atomic systems and processes is reviewed. Theoretical framework for treating resonances in the coupled channel approximation using the R-matrix method, as well as approximations related to plasma applications are described. The former entails large-scale atomic computations, and the latter is based on a new method for including collisional, Stark, thermal and other broadening mechanisms. We focus particularly on the problem of opacities calculations in high-energy-density (HED) plasmas such as stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion devices. The treatment is generally relevant to radiative and collisional processes as the cross sections become energy-temperature-density dependent. While the computational difficulty increases considerably, the reaction rates are significantly affected. The related issue of the Boltzmann-Saha equation-of-state and its variants in local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) is also explored as the intermediary between atomic data on the one hand and plasma environments on the other.</description>

      <title>Applications of Fast Magnetic Reconnection Models to the Atmospheres of the Sun and Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially-ionized plasmas consist of charged and neutral particles whose mutual collisions modify magnetic reconnection compared with the fully-ionized case. The collisions alter the rate and locations of the magnetic dissipation heating and the distribution of energies among the particles accelerated into the non-thermal tail. We examine the collisional regimes for the onset of fast reconnection in two environments: the partially-ionized layers of the solar atmosphere and the protoplanetary disks that are the birthplaces for planets around young stars. In both these environments, magnetic nulls readily develop into resistive current sheets in the regime where the charged and neutral particles are fully coupled by collisions, but the current sheets quickly break down under the ideal tearing instability. The current sheets collapse repeatedly, forming magnetic islands at successively smaller scales, till they enter a collisionally-decoupled regime where the magnetic energy is rapidly turned into heat and charged-particle kinetic energy. Small-scale, decoupled fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere may lead to preferential heating and energization of ions and electrons that escape into the corona. In protoplanetary disks such reconnection causes localized heating in the atmospheric layers that produce much of the infrared atomic and molecular line emission observed with the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Temperature Relaxation in the Postshock Plasma of the Northwestern Limb of SN 1006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heating of charged particles via collisionless shocks, while ubiquitous in the universe, is an intriguing yet puzzling plasma phenomenon. One outstanding question is how electrons and ions approach an equilibrium after they were heated to different immediate-postshock temperatures. In order to fill the significant lack of observational information of the downstream temperature-relaxation process, we observe a thermal-dominant X-ray filament in the northwest of SN~1006 with Chandra. We divide this region into four layers with a thickness of 15$^{\prime\prime}$ or 0.16 pc each, and fit each spectrum by a non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model. The electron temperature was found to increase toward downstream from 0.52-0.62 keV to 0.82-0.95 keV on a length scale of 60 arcsec (or 0.64 pc). This electron temperature is lower than thermal relaxation processes via Coulomb scattering, requiring some other effects such as plasma mixture due to turbulence and/or projection effects, etc, which we hope will be resolved with future X-ray calorimeter missions such as XRISM and Athena.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Resolution X-ray Thomson Scattering Measurements of Electronic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a novel ultrahigh resolution ($\Delta E \sim 0.1\,$eV) setup to measure electronic features in x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at the European XFEL in Germany, we have studied the collective plasmon excitation in aluminium at ambient conditions, which we can measure very accurately even at low momentum transfers. As a result, we can resolve previously reported discrepancies between ab initio time-dependent density functional theory simulations and experimental observations. The demonstrated capability for high-resolution XRTS measurements will be a game changer for the diagnosis of experiments with matter under extreme densities, temperatures, and pressures, and unlock the full potential of state-of-the-art x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities to study planetary interior conditions, to understand inertial confinement fusion applications, and for material science and discovery.</description>

      <title>Review of the high-power vacuum tube microwave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.04288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the first vacuum tube (X-ray tube) was invented by Wilhelm R\"ontgen in Germany, after more than one hundred years of development, the average power density of the vacuum tube microwave source has reached the order of 108 [MW][GHz]2. The maximum power density record was created by the Free Electron Lasers. In the high-power microwave field, the vacuum devices are still the mainstream microwave sources for applications such as scientific instruments, communications, radars, magnetic confinement fusion heating, microwave weapons, etc. The principles of microwave generation by vacuum tube microwave sources include Cherenkov or Smith-Purcell radiation, transition radiation, and Bremsstrahlung. In this paper, the vacuum tube microwave sources were reviewed in order according to the three radiation principles. Among them, the Vircators can produce 22 GW output power in P-band (0.23-1GHz). Vacuum tubes that can achieve continuous-wave operation include Traveling Wave Tubes, Klystrons, Free Electron Lasers, and Magnetrons, with output power up to 1MW. Vacuum tubes that can generate frequencies of the order of 100 GHz and above include Klystrons, Traveling Wave Tubes, Gyrotrons, Backward Wave Oscillators, Magnetrons, Surface Wave Oscillators, Free Electron Lasers, Orotrons, etc. Gyrotrons are very attractive in the millimeter wave and THz fields. The Gyrotrons can output power at the MW level with 3000s pulse width at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of dissipation for Maxwell equations in dispersive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dispersive media, dissipation appears in the Schr\"odinger representation of classical Maxwell equations as a sparse diagonal operator occupying an $r$-dimensional subspace. A first order Suzuki-Trotter approximation for the evolution operator enables us to isolate the non-unitary operators (associated with dissipation) from the unitary operators (associated with lossless media). The unitary operators can be implemented through qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) on $n$ qubits. However, the non-unitary-dissipative part poses a challenge on how it should be implemented on a quantum computer. In this paper, two probabilistic dilation algorithms are considered for handling the dissipative operators. The first algorithm is based on treating the classical dissipation as a linear amplitude damping-type completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum channel where the combined system-environment must undergo unitary evolution in the dilated space. The unspecified environment can be modeled by just one ancillary qubit, resulting in an implementation scaling of $\textit{O}(2^{n-1}n^2)$ elementary gates for the dilated unitary evolution operator. The second algorithm approximates the non-unitary operators by the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU). We obtain an optimized representation of the non-unitary part, which requires $\textit{O}(2^{n})$ elementary gates. Applying the LCU method for a simple dielectric medium with homogeneous dissipation rate, the implementation scaling can be further reduced into $\textit{O}[poly(n)]$ basic gates. For the particular case of weak dissipation we show that our proposed post-selective dilation algorithms can efficiently delve into the transient evolution dynamics of dissipative systems by calculating the respective implementation circuit depth. A connection of our results with the non-linear-in-normalization-only (NINO) quantum channels is also presented.</description>
