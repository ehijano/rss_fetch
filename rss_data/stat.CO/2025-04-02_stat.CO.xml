      <title>pumBayes: Bayesian Estimation of Probit Unfolding Models for Binary Preference Data in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probit unfolding models (PUMs) are a novel class of scaling models that allow for items with both monotonic and non-monotonic response functions and have shown great promise in the estimation of preferences from voting data in various deliberative bodies. This paper presents the R package pumBayes, which enables Bayesian inference for both static and dynamic PUMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that require minimal or no tuning. In addition to functions that carry out the sampling from the posterior distribution of the models, the package also includes various support functions that can be used to pre-process data, select hyperparameters, summarize output, and compute metrics of model fit. We demonstrate the use of the package through an analysis of two datasets, one corresponding to roll-call voting data from the 116th U.S. House of Representatives, and a second one corresponding to voting records in the U.S. Supreme Court between 1937 and 2021.</description>

      <title>Scalable Durational Event Models: Application to Physical and Digital Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Durable interactions are ubiquitous in social network analysis and are increasingly observed with precise time stamps. Phone and video calls, for example, are events to which a specific duration can be assigned. We refer to this type of data encoding the start and end times of interactions as "durational event data". Recent advances in data collection have enabled the observation of such data over extended periods of time and between large populations of actors. Building on Relational Event Models, we propose the "Durational Event Model" as a framework for studying durational events by separately modeling event incidence and duration. To accommodate large-scale applications, we introduce a fast, memory-efficient, and exact block-coordinate ascent algorithm. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate several advantages of this approach over traditional Newton-Raphson-based methods. We apply the model to physical and digital interactions among college students in Copenhagen. Our empirical findings reveal that past interactions are the main drivers of physical interactions, whereas digital interactions are more strongly influenced by friendship ties and prior dyadic contact.</description>

      <title>Detecting adverse high-order drug interactions from individual case safety reports using computational statistics on disproportionality measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adverse drug interactions are a critical concern in pharmacovigilance, as both clinical trials and spontaneous reporting systems often lack the breadth to detect complex drug interactions. This study introduces a computational framework for adverse drug interaction detection, leveraging disproportionality analysis on individual case safety reports. By integrating the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification, the framework extends beyond drug interactions to capture hierarchical pharmacological relationships. To address biases inherent in existing disproportionality measures, we employ a hypergeometric risk metric, while a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm provides robust empirical p-value estimation for the risk associated to cocktails. A genetic algorithm further facilitates efficient identification of high-risk drug cocktails. Validation on synthetic and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data demonstrates the method's efficacy in detecting established drugs and drug interactions associated with myopathy-related adverse events. Implemented as an R package, this framework offers a reproducible, scalable tool for post-market drug safety surveillance.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of high-dimensional penalized piecewise constant hazard random effects models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and characterizing relationships between treatments, exposures, or other covariates and time-to-event outcomes has great significance in a wide range of biomedical settings. In research areas such as multi-center clinical trials, recurrent events, and genetic studies, proportional hazard mixed effects models (PHMMs) are used to account for correlations observed in clusters within the data. In high dimensions, proper specification of the fixed and random effects within PHMMs is difficult and computationally complex. In this paper, we approximate the proportional hazards mixed effects model with a piecewise constant hazard mixed effects survival model. We estimate the model parameters using a modified Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional Minimization algorithm, allowing us to perform variable selection on both the fixed and random effects simultaneously. We also incorporate a factor model decomposition of the random effects in order to more easily scale the variable selection method to larger dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulations, and we apply our method to a multi-study pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma gene expression dataset to select features important for survival.</description>

      <title>Assessing and improving reliability of neighbor embedding methods: a map-continuity perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing high-dimensional data is essential for understanding biomedical data and deep learning models. Neighbor embedding methods, such as t-SNE and UMAP, are widely used but can introduce misleading visual artifacts. We find that the manifold learning interpretations from many prior works are inaccurate and that the misuse stems from a lack of data-independent notions of embedding maps, which project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. Leveraging the leave-one-out principle, we introduce LOO-map, a framework that extends embedding maps beyond discrete points to the entire input space. We identify two forms of map discontinuity that distort visualizations: one exaggerates cluster separation and the other creates spurious local structures. As a remedy, we develop two types of point-wise diagnostic scores to detect unreliable embedding points and improve hyperparameter selection, which are validated on datasets from computer vision and single-cell omics.</description>
