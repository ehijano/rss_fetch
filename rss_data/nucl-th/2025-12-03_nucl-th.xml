      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle and Angular Momentum Generation in Microscopic Fission Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of angular momentum (intrinsic spin) in fission fragments has recently attracted renewed attention. While several microscopic approaches reproduce the spin distribution qualitatively using projection techniques, the physical origin of the fragments' angular momentum in density functional theory remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms responsible for the spin distribution of fission fragments within a microscopic TDDFT framework. We compare spin distributions obtained from projection operators with those predicted by a simple expression derived from the uncertainty relation between angle and angular momentum, where angular fluctuations are estimated using a Monte Carlo sampling of nucleon positions. We find that a large portion of the spin distribution obtained from projection methods can be explained by the uncertainty principle. Our results thus show that, within microscopic approaches, the spin of fission fragments originates primarily from quantum uncertainty associated with their orientation angle with respect to the fission axis, mainly due to quadrupole deformation and, to a lesser extent, octupole deformation.</description>

      <title>Neutron-deuteron scattering revisited with the EKM chiral nuclear force and the WPCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the neutron-deuteron scattering using the Wave-Packet Continuum Discretization (WPCD) method with the EKM chiral nuclear force at various chiral orders. We rederive the permutation operator and solve the Faddeev-AGS equations directly, without rewriting the initial Faddeev kernel $tG_0$ and introducing pseudo-states, thereby rendering the approach easily extendable to a relativistic framework. We find that up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO), although one can well describe the differential cross sections, one cannot resolve the long-standing $A_y$ puzzle, consistent with previous studies. The fact that the N$^3$LO chiral forces can well describe the $NN$ phase shifts and the results obtained with the EKM and Idaho N$^3$LO chiral forces agree with each other underscores the need for further investigations to resolve the $A_y$ puzzle, e.g., considering three-body forces or relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Excitation function of femtoscopic L\'evy source parameters of pion pairs in EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) femtoscopic source parameters of pions provide a sensitive probe of the space-time structure of particle-emitting sources in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Compared to one-dimensional measurements, 3D femtoscopy not only provides a valuable cross-check but also offers a more complete characterization of the source geometry and its dynamical evolution. Particularly, differences between the "out" and "side" directions are sensitive to signals of a strong first-order phase transition, while the collision-energy dependence of Levy radii may reveal non-monotonic features related to the equation of state (EoS).
  In this work, we systematically investigate the transverse mass and collision-energy dependence of the three-dimensional femtoscopic parameters of pion pairs with Levy-type sources in the STAR Beam Energy Scan (BES) range from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ to $200$ GeV using the EPOS4 model. The analyzed parameters include the Levy index $\alpha$, the correlation strength $\lambda$, and the three-dimensional radii $R_{\rm {out}}$, $R_{\rm side}$ and $R_{\rm long}$ , derived quantities such as the radius difference $R_{\rm diff} = R_{\rm out}^2 - R_{\rm side}^2$ and the ratio $R_{\rm out}/R_{\rm side}$ are also investigated. The results show that the extracted radii $R_{\rm {side}}$ and $R_{\rm long}$ decrease with increasing transverse momentum and increase gradually with collision energy, while $R_{\rm {out}}$ shows little energy dependence. The Levy index $\alpha$ exhibits only a mild dependence on $m_T$ and collision energy, whereas the correlation strength $\lambda$ shows a clear $m_T$ dependence and generally decreases with increasing collision energy. A comparison with EPOS3 results indicates general agreement within approximately 2$\sigma$, with the notable exception of $R_{\rm side}$, which is systematically smaller in EPOS4.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric coefficients of two-flavor quark matter from the Kubo formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot quark matter created in heavy-ion collision experiments can exhibit strong temperature and chemical-potential gradients, which in turn can generate electric fields through thermoelectric effects. In this work, we investigate two relevant thermoelectric coefficients -- the thermopower (Seebeck coefficient) and the Thomson coefficient -- of two-flavor quark matter using the Kubo formalism and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as an effective description of dense, finite-temperature QCD. The required two-point equilibrium correlation functions are evaluated using the Matsubara formalism of thermal field theory, applying a 1/Nc expansion to the relevant multi-loop Feynman diagrams. We employ previously derived quark spectral functions obtained from one--meson-exchange diagrams above the Mott transition temperature. Our numerical results show that both thermoelectric coefficients increase approximately linearly with temperature and decrease with increasing chemical potential. We also estimate the magnitude of the electric fields that can be generated in heavy-ion collisions by thermal gradients via the Seebeck effect.</description>

      <title>Experimental constraints on $\gamma$-ray strength function of $^{72}$Ga from $^{72}\mathrm{Ga(n,\gamma)^{72}Ga}$ capture data and reevaluation of Maxwellian-averaged cross sections of $^{71}$Ga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray strength function of medium-mass neutron rich nuclei $^{72}$Ga has been extracted from the statistical Hauser-Feshbach analysis of the available capture data of $^{71}\mathrm{Ga}(n,\gamma){}^{72}\mathrm{Ga}$ over the 0.01 - 3 MeV energy range with the required nuclear level density (NLD) of the $^{72}$Ga constraint from the work of R. Santra et al.,[\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.107.064611}{Physical Review C 107, 064611 (2023)}]. The Gogny D1M model for the E1 and M1 strength functions, including low-energy upbends of $^{72}$Ga nuclei, is experimentally constrained in the present work. Subsequently, the Maxwellian-averaged cross section(MACS) of $^{71}\mathrm{Ga}$ has been reevaluated based on the present $\gamma$-ray strength function. It is found that the present MACS value at \(kT = 30\) keV is 115.35$^{+11.92}_{-10.44}$ mb, which is consistent with previous work.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal DVCS with spinless hadron-to-two-hadron transition $\gamma^* \pi \to \gamma \pi \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the formalism of hadron-to-two-hadron transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for spinless hadron case. Definitions of the twist-2 unpolarized and polarized $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs are introduced with a particular choice of kinematic variables that characterize the produced two-pion system. In the vicinity of $\rho(770)$, we work out the two-pion decay angular distributions of the $e^-\pi\to e^-\gamma\pi\pi$ cross section, incorporating both the Bethe-Heitler and deeply virtual Compton scattering processes. Each cross section exhibits a distinctive angular distribution, which is sensitive to the polarization states of the produced $\rho(770)$ resonance. In addition, we construct the double partial-wave expansion of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in the two-pion decay angles as a generalization of GPDs for transition from a pion to a spin-$\ell$ resonance state. With the help of the Omn\`es representation, we constrain the $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in terms of the low energy $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shift and build a phenomenological model for these GPDs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Spin-Interference Effects in Exclusive $J/\psi \to e^+e^-$ Photoproduction in Ultraperipheral Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first evidence of spin interference in exclusive $J/\psi \to e^+e^-$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral Au+Au and isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV) at STAR. A negative $\cos(2\phi)$ modulation is observed for $p_T &lt; 100$ MeV/$c$, opposite in sign to that in $\rho^{0}\!\to\!\pi^+\pi^-$ photoproduction. This establishes for the first time that the interference sign is controlled by the spin structure of the final-state daughters, resolving the ambiguity present in the all-boson $\rho^0$ channel. The compact $J/\psi$ probes gluon distributions at perturbative scales, resulting in a weaker modulation and providing stringent constraints on Color Glass Condensate calculations. These findings demonstrate that spin-dependent interference in heavy vector mesons provides a new, experimentally accessible handle on gluon structure beyond traditional cross-section measurements.</description>

      <title>Inferring three-nucleon couplings from multi-messenger neutron-star observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between nucleons in dense matter is an important challenge in theoretical physics. Effective field theories have emerged as the dominant approach to address this problem at low energies, with many successful applications to the structure of nuclei and the properties of dense nucleonic matter. However, how far into the interior of neutron stars these interactions can describe dense matter is an open question. Here, we develop a framework that enables the inference of three-nucleon couplings in dense matter directly from astrophysical neutron star observations. We apply this formalism to the LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave event GW170817 and the X-ray measurements from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and establish direct constraints for the couplings that govern three-nucleon interactions in chiral effective field theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate how next-generation observations of a population of neutron star mergers can offer stringent constraints on three-nucleon couplings, potentially at a level comparable to those from laboratory data. Our work directly connects the microscopic couplings in quantum field theories to macroscopic observations of neutron stars, providing a way to test the consistency between low-energy couplings inferred from terrestrial and astrophysical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter obtained in many-body-perturbation theory (MBPT) up to third order, based on various chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions used in ab initio calculations of nuclei. We extract equation of state properties, such as the incompressibility and the symmetry energy, and discuss estimates of the theoretical uncertainties due to neglected higher-order contributions in the MBPT expansion as well as the chiral effective field theory expansion. In addition, we discuss the Fermi liquid approach to nuclear matter. We calculate all two- and three-nucleon contributions to the quasiparticle interaction up to second order in MBPT and present results for the Landau parameters, effective mass, and speed of sound for pure neutron matter.</description>

Abstract: We study heat conduction and momentum transport in the context of stochastic fluid dynamics. We consider a fluid described by model H in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin. We study both non-critical and critical fluids, and we investigate transport properties in two as well as three dimensions. Our results are based on numerical simulations of model H using a Metropolis algorithm, and we employ Kubo relations to extract transport coefficients. We observe the expected logarithmic divergence of the shear viscosity in a two-dimensional non-critical fluid. At a critical point, we find that the transport coefficients exhibit power-law scaling with the system size $L$. The strongest divergence is seen for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ in two dimensions. We find $\kappa\sim L^{x_\kappa}$ with $x_\kappa=1.6\pm 0.1$. The divergence is weaker in three dimensions, $x_\kappa=1.25 \pm 0.3$, and the scaling exponent for the shear viscosity, $x_\eta$, is significantly smaller than $x_\kappa$ in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Probing confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics and play an important role in condensed matter physics. The constituents of gauge theories, for example charged matter and electric gauge field, are governed by local gauge constraints, which lead to key phenomena such as confinement of particles that are not fully understood. In this context, quantum simulators may address questions that are challenging for classical methods. While engineering gauge constraints is highly demanding, recent advances in quantum computing are beginning to enable digital quantum simulations of gauge theories. Here, we simulate confinement dynamics in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on a superconducting quantum processor. Tuning a term that couples only to the electric field produces confinement of charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we show how a modification of the gauge constraint from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ towards $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work illustrates the restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory, it showcases how gauge constraints can be modified and protected, and it promotes the study of other models governed by multi-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of $\mu \to e$ interactions in the SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study current experimental bounds on charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) $\mu$-$e$ interactions in the model-independent framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Assuming a generic flavor structure in the quark sector, we consider the contributions of CLFV operators to low-energy observables, including $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to e$ conversion for quark-flavor conserving operators and CLFV meson decays for quark-flavor violating operators. At high energy, we consider limits on CLFV decays of the Higgs and Z bosons and of the top quark, and obtain bounds on operators with light quarks by recasting searches for production of $e\mu$ pairs in $pp$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We connect observables at low- and high-energy by taking into account renormalization group running and matching between CLFV operators. We also discuss the sensitivity of the future Electron-Ion Collider, where the prospective bounds are derived by imposing simple cuts on final state particles. We find that, in a single operator scenario, bounds on purely leptonic operators are dominated by $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. Semileptonic operators with down-type quarks are also dominantly constrained by low-energy observables, while LHC searches lead the bounds on up-type quark-flavor violating operators. Taking simplified multiple-coupling scenarios, we show that it is easy to evade the strongest low-energy bounds from spin-independent $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, and that collider searches are competitive and complementary to constraints from spin-dependent $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion and other low-energy probes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factor of the kaon in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factor (GFF) of the kaon is investigated in a bottom-up holographic QCD model, in which the strange quark mass breaks the SU(3) flavor symmetry. The probe energy ($Q^2$) dependence of the kaon GFF is explicitly shown and compared to that of the pion. It is presented that our result shows the $1/Q^2$ behavior in the high energy region, which is consistent with the perturbative QCD prediction. The gravitational radius of the kaon is also calculated, and it is found that the result is quite close to that of the pion but slightly smaller.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification factor within a dynamical approach to the complex entropic index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to the nuclear deformation factor $R_{\text{AA}}$, grounded in the dynamical effects of the Quark-Gluon Plasma on parton momentum. The approach uses the Blast-Wave method combined with Tsallis Statistics, within the Cooper-Frye freeze-out framework and, by profiting from appropriate simplifications, it gives analytical expressions that describe the observed $R_{\text{AA}}$ for two sets of independent measurements at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. A nonlinear dynamical equation describes the dynamics and leads to log-periodic oscillations. With the analytical solutions for that equation, it is possible to link the dynamical approach with the complex-$q$ formalism, which was proposed to describe the log-oscillations observed in experimental data.</description>

      <title>Saturation effects in exclusive vector meson production in DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate saturation effects in exclusive vector meson production in deep inelastic scattering (DIS), where we model fluctuations within the target protons as localized color-charge hotspots. Based on the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework and the dipole picture for vector meson production, we examine the dependencies of coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections on the momentum transfer. We draw conclusions on the effectiveness of our hot spot model and the strength of the suppression of the scattering cross sections caused by saturation effects. We find that saturation has mild effects in the given energy and charge-density ranges, but can also show that suppression becomes more prominent as the color-charge density inside the proton increases.</description>
