      <title>Variance-Hawkes Process and its Application to Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new model using a Hawkes process as a subordinator in a standard Brownian motion. We demonstrate that this Hawkes subordinated Brownian motion or more succinctly, variance-Hawkes process can be fit to 2018 and 2019 natural gas and crude oil front-month futures log returns. This variance-Hawkes process allows financial models to easily have clustering effects encoded into their behaviour in a simple and tractable way. We also compare the simulations of a square of a variance Hawkes process with its Ito formula. We simulate both processes and compare their distributions, trajectories, and percent errors across multiple runs. We derive the generator relating to this Hawkes subordinated Brownian motion, calculate several moments, and conjecture its distribution. We also provide explicit solutions to the second moments of the Hawkes process and its intensity as well as the cross moment between the Hawkes process and its intensity in the case of an exponential kernel.</description>

      <title>Cross-Currency Basis Swaps Referencing Backward-Looking Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The financial industry has undergone a significant transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to Risk Free Rates (RFR) such as, e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the AUD Overnight Index Average (AONIA) in Australia, as the primary benchmark rate for borrowing costs. The paper examines the pricing and hedging method for SOFR-related financial products in a cross-currency context with the special emphasis on the Compound SOFR vs Average AONIA cross-currency basis swaps. While the SOFR and AONIA serve as a particular case of a cross-currency basis swap (CCBS), the approach developed is able to handle backward-looking term rates for any two currencies. We give explicit pricing and hedging results for collateralized cross-currency basis swaps using interest rate and currency futures contracts as hedging tools within an arbitrage-free multi-curve setting.</description>

      <title>Term structure shapes and their consistent dynamics in the Svensson family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the shapes attainable by the forward- and yield-curve in the widely-used Svensson family, including the Nelson-Siegel and Bliss subfamilies. We provide a complete classification of all attainable shapes and partition the parameter space of each family according to these shapes. Building upon these results, we then examine the consistent dynamic evolution of the Svensson family under absence of arbitrage. Our analysis shows that consistent dynamics further restrict the set of attainable shapes, and we demonstrate that certain complex shapes can no longer appear after a deterministic time horizon. Moreover a single shape (either inverse of normal curves) must dominate in the long-run.</description>
