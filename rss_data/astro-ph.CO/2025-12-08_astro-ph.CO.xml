      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (IV) CMB Spectral and Anisotropy Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are macroscopic dark-matter candidates, with masses of the order of a few grams to a kilogram and sub-micron radius, thought to form at the Quantum Chromo Dynamic era through axion-induced charge separation. This framework naturally links the dark and visible matter abundances ($\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry where dark matter is composed of matter AQNs and antimatter AQNs. Although behaving as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, baryons annihilate with antimatter AQNs, producing ionizing high-energy photons. The resulting energy injection may imprint spectral distortions on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and modify the reionization history. Using a modified version of the \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code we compute the impact of this energy injection on the $\mu$ and $y$ spectral distortion parameters as well as on the optical depth. We find that (1) the CMB anisotropies remain essentially unaffected by baryon annihilation, and (2) the associated spectral distortion signatures lie within the sensitivity reach of proposed CMB spectral distortion missions. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences between the AQN scenario and annihilating or decaying dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Spinning Primordial Black Holes and Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves from Single Field Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), their spin and abundance, in a single-field inflationary model based on a mutated hilltop potential inserted with a small step-like feature. This step induces a brief phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation, producing the large enhancement of the scalar power spectrum required for an appreciable amount of PBH abundance. Instead of the commonly used analytical power spectra, we compute the primordial power spectrum accurately by numerically solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the obtained power spectrum, we apply peak theory with $\nabla^2 \zeta$ treated as a Gaussian random field and parametrize the curvature profile by its amplitude $\mu$ and characteristic width $K$. Confining the study to Type-I PBH, the threshold value is calculated using two robust methods: the average of the compaction function and the q-function method. Using the result, the dimensionless spin parameter of the resulting PBHs is calculated at linear order and found to be $\sqrt{\langle a_\star^2 \rangle} \sim 10^{-3}$; however, it can be higher for smaller masses. We present detailed predictions for two representative parameter sets, calculate the present-day PBH mass function $f_{\rm PBH}(M)$ and the associated scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). The first produces PBHs of mass $M \simeq 10^{-13}\,M_\odot$ that can account for $100\%$ of dark matter, while the second yields $M \simeq 10^{-2}\,M_\odot$ PBHs contributing approximately $2.4\%$ of the dark matter density. The predicted signals of SIGWs lie within the sensitivity bands of future experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and SKA. In particular, the second parameter set produces a SIGWs compatible with the recent NANOGrav evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave signal.</description>

      <title>Absorption in the 21 cm Hydrogen Line at $z&gt;10$ as a Sensitive Tool for the Construction of a Cosmological Model on Small Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background absorption intensity in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in the presence of additional power in the form of a "bump" in the spectrum of cosmological density perturbations is calculated. The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k&gt;1$~Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile.</description>

      <title>How Dark Sector Equations of State Govern Interaction Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using late-Universe observations, we demonstrate that freeing dark energy and dark matter equations of state (EoS) dramatically alters the inferred strength and direction of their interactions. When dark sector EoS are fixed to $w_{\mathrm{de}}=-1$ and $w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$, the data consistently favor an energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter across various interaction forms. This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\mathrm{de}}&gt;-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy. These findings caution against the simplistic assumption of $\Lambda$CDM EoS values when attempting to detect a possible interaction. Despite these fundamental degeneracies, model comparison using the Akaike and Deviance information criteria shows that all of the tested interacting dark energy scenarios receive substantial support over the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Growth rate measurements from a joint analysis of the large-scale galaxy clustering in Fourier and configuration space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test a framework to perform the analysis of redshift-space distortions simultaneously in configuration and Fourier space. We test our methods with the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations as well as a more numerous set of approximate EZmocks, reproducing the sample of luminous red galaxies of from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and its extension (eBOSS). Our clustering models are based on the effective field theory of large-scale structures in a Lagrangian frame, used in the latest results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. We perform a template type of analysis, including dilation parameters and the slope parameter from the ShapeFit framework. We find that the joint space inference yields unbiased and robust constraints on simulated datasets, consistent with results from individual spaces or previous methods to obtain consensus results. Our joint space analysis on the the BOSS+eBOSS LRG sample obtains $ f\sigma_8 = 0.463 \pm 0.052 $, in good agreement with the official 2020 results.</description>

      <title>Squared-field cross-correlation between kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and 21-cm intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm intensity mapping is an effective method to track the distribution of baryonic matter, and extract astrophysical and cosmological information. The 21-cm intensity field has a non-vanishing cross-correlation with the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect that traces the velocity and density perturbations of free electrons. By using the linear perturbation theory, in this paper we calculate analytically, for the first time, the cross-correlation between the squared kSZ field and the projection of the squared HI intensity mapping field with the flat-sky approximation. This statistic remains non-vanishing even after the long-wavelength line-of-sight modes ($k_{\parallel}$) are removed due to foreground contamination. We further forecast for the prospects of detection with the SKA-MID 21-cm intensity mapping experiments (redshifts in range of $0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1$), and the kSZ maps measured by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Simons Observatory (SO). The predicted cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is $1.92$ for SKA-ACT and $3.99$ for SKA-SO. These results show a possible on-the-edge detection on the cross-correlation signal at low redshifts, which in turn could serve as a validation step towards using it for the Epoch of Reionization studies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on nDGP gravity from SPT galaxy clusters with DES and HST weak-lensing mass calibration and from Planck PR4 CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) braneworld gravity model from the abundance of massive galaxy clusters. On scales below the nDGP crossover scale $r_{\rm c}$, the nDGP model features an effective gravity-like fifth force that alters the growth of structure, leading to an enhancement of the halo mass function (HMF) on cluster scales. The enhanced cluster abundance allows for constraints on the nDGP model using cluster samples. We employ the SPT cluster sample, selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and with mass calibration using weak-lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample contains 1,005 clusters with redshifts $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.78$, which are confirmed with the Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm using optical and near-infrared data. Weak-lensing data from DES and HST enable a robust mass measurement of the cluster sample. We use DES Year 3 data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z &lt; 0.95$, and HST data for 39 clusters with redshifts $ 0.6 &lt; z &lt;1.7$. We account for the enhancement in the HMF through a semi-analytic correction factor to the $\nu\Lambda$CDM HMF derived from the spherical collapse model in the nDGP model. We then further calibrate this model using $N$-body simulations. In addition, for the first time, we analyze the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from Planck PR4 within the nDGP model. We obtain a competitive constraint from the joint analysis of the SPT cluster abundance with the Planck PR4 data, and report an upper bound of $1/\sqrt{H_0r_{\rm c}}&lt; 1.41$ at $95\%$ when assuming a cosmology with massive neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A redshift-independent theoretical halo mass function validated with the Uchuu simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical framework for the halo mass function (HMF) that accurately predicts the abundance of dark matter haloes across an exceptionally wide range in mass and redshift. Building on a generalised Press &amp; Schechter model and triaxial collapse (GPS+), we predict the HMF in terms of the variance of the linear density field, with only a weak explicit dependence on halo mass and no explicit dependence on redshift. The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 &lt; log($M_{\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\odot}$]) &lt;16 over 0 &lt; z &lt; 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z &lt; 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within ~20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan &amp; Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF.</description>

      <title>Thermal Damping of Mass-Modulating Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological evolution of a scalar field is shaped by Hubble damping. Any non-gravitational couplings of the scalar with the primordial thermal bath generically contribute additional damping. Although rarely considered, such thermal damping could be the dominant dissipative effect. We derive approximate but highly general thermal-damping rates of scalar fields that modulate the masses of thermally populated particles. We extend previous results to cover cases of particular phenomenological interest where the scalar background oscillates sinusoidally but not necessarily slowly compared to the thermalization rates of the primordial bath. Based on these results, we estimate the thermal damping of scalars coupled to neutrinos linearly, to gluons quadratically, and to WIMPs linearly, and demonstrate its importance in certain parameter space of these models. We also estimate the thermal damping rates in models of QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Illuminating sequential freeze-in dark matter with dark photon signal at the CERN SHiP experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves observable footprints in dark matter direct detection, collider or fixed-target experiments, which can be altered in the two-field context. In this work, we consider sequential freeze-in dark matter through signals of dark photon mediator with a mass range of $m_{A'}\sim 10^{-2}-10$ GeV covered by the proposed SHiP experiment. We show that the dark charge is fixed to be $e'\sim 1.3\times 10^{-12}$ and the mixing parameter is restricted to $10^{-11}\leq \epsilon&lt; 10^{-8}-10^{-7.5}$, as a result of the out-of-equilibrium condition of dark photon and the observed relic abundance of dark matter. Within this $\epsilon$ region, the 5(15)-year data of proton bremsstrahlung process for the dark photon, assuming vector meson (dipole) dominance, excludes $\epsilon\geq 10^{-8.5} (10^{-7.9})$ at 90\% confidence level, implying only a narrow region of $\epsilon$ close to $\sim 10^{-11}$ left for alternative tests.</description>

      <title>Ruminations Upon the Modeling of X-ray Foregrounds, Backgrounds and Faint Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the goal of extracting as much information as possible from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of faint, diffuse sources such as galaxy clusters, as well as those of future X-ray telescopes, we present a strategy for forward modeling all the foreground and background signals present in these data. This work leverages widespread efforts to understand the soft X-ray emission from the Galaxy, as well as the cosmic X-ray background and instrument-specific, particle-induced backgrounds. Statistically, a forward model of the foregrounds and backgrounds is preferable to alternatives because it requires no binning of the data, and allows straightforward marginalization over systematic uncertainties. We apply these methods to several galaxy clusters at intermediate-to-high redshifts, spanning a range of masses and morphologies, using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data. Our results suggest a modest improvement even for relatively bright clusters at these redshifts, and more substantial advantages in the high-redshift, low-surface-brightness regime. We also discuss and provide a simple correction for a time-dependent miscalibration of the Chandra ACIS detectors identified in archival galaxy cluster data.</description>

      <title>Gauge-independent treatment of electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first certificate of the gauge-independent bubble nucleation at the electroweak phase transition with the standard model effective field theory. Taking advantage of the thermal effective field theory framework, with the power counting $\lambda \sim g^3$, we rigorously demonstrate the gauge independence of the bubble nucleation rate up to two-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of relevant phase transition parameters on the gauge parameter and investigate its implications for gravitational waves generated by the electroweak phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Majorana Dark Matter and Its Self-Interactions in a Gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an inelastic Majorana dark matter model gauged by $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, featuring a complex scalar and fermions with a small Dirac mass. The model exhibits strong interactions between the dark fermion-antifermion pair and the scalar, with a large coupling generating a Majorana mass after symmetry breaking. The dark fermion splits into two nearly degenerate Majorana eigenstates, with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson $Z^\prime$ interacting via inelastic axial vector currents. The lighter Majorana serves as dark matter (DM), while the heavier may also contribute. The model predicts DM masses ranging from about 10 GeV to hundreds of GeV, with the scalar favored below 100 MeV. Strong coupling causes DM particles to mainly annihilate into two scalars, which determines the relic abundance, while thermal equilibrium with the bath occurs through $Z^\prime$ interactions. Self-interacting DM particles scatter via ladder exchange of strongly coupled light scalars, helping resolve small-scale issues. The $Z^\prime$ interacts with the muon, affecting its magnetic moment and explaining the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy. Effects on experiments, $N_{\text{eff}}$, and the Hubble tension from kinetic mixing between $Z^\prime$ and the photon, originating from high-energy scales, are discussed. The model details and parameter constraints used in experiments are also covered.</description>

      <title>Stellar cores live long and prosper in cuspy dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of cuspy or cored centers of dark matter halos is a crucial discriminant between different dark matter models. It has recently been claimed based on dynamical arguments that perfectly cored stellar systems cannot survive inside cuspy dark matter halos, which would make the observation of stellar cores in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where dark matter cores cannot form through baryonic processes, a direct falsification of the cold dark matter paradigm. Here, we use idealized simulations to show explicitly that cored stellar systems like those observed in dwarf galaxies can be stable within cuspy dark matter halos over at least several Hubble times. We also demonstrate that observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies cannot distinguish mildly positive, flat, or negative inner density slopes, further precluding the dynamical inference of the gravitational potential from the stellar configuration.</description>

      <title>Learning the Cosmic Web: Graph-based Classification of Simulated Galaxies by their Dark Matter Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{&gt;10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic isotropy: Hubble constant and matter density large-angle variations with the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we investigate potential large-angle anisotropies in the angular distribution of the cosmological parameters $H_0$ (the Hubble constant) and $\Omega_m$ (the matter density) in the flat-$\Lambda$CDM framework, using the Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae catalog. For this we perform a directional analysis by dividing the celestial sphere into a set of directions, and estimate the best-fit cosmological parameters across the sky using a MCMC approach. Our results show a dominant dipolar pattern for both parameters in study, suggesting a preferred axis in the universe expansion and in the distribution of matter. However, we also found that for $z \gtrsim 0.015$, this dipolar behavior is not statistically significant, confirming the expectation -- in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario -- of an isotropic expansion and a uniform angular distribution of matter (both results at $1\,\sigma$ confidence level). Nevertheless, for nearby supernovae, at distances $\lesssim 60$ Mpc or $z \lesssim 0.015$, the peculiar velocities introduce a highly significant dipole in the angular distribution of $H_0$. Furthermore, we perform various robustness tests that support our findings, and consistency tests of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: $w$CDM cosmology from simulation-based inference with persistent homology on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing data using persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique that tracks how features like clusters and voids evolve across density thresholds. For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys can be used to measure the dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in the luminosity distances inferred from type-Ia supernova observations, and in the spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars. The measurements of these cosmic dipoles appear to be mutually inconsistent, even though they are expected to indicate the common observer velocity. This observational tension may represent a significant challenge to the standard model of cosmology. Here we study in detail what contributes to the cosmic dipoles from CMB, supernova, and galaxy survey in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, though our theoretical model can be applied beyond the standard model. While measurements of the cosmic dipoles yield the relative velocities between the source samples and the observer velocity, the motion of the observer is the dominant contribution in the conformal Newtonian gauge, and the intrinsic velocities of the samples fall steeply with increasing redshift of the sources. Hence the cosmic dipoles of CMB, type-Ia supernovae, and galaxies should be aligned but can have different amplitudes. We also clarify several misconceptions that are commonly found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Biased Domain Walls and the Origin of Early Massive Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use a non-parametric analytical model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls - originating in models with an approximate (or biased) discrete symmetry breaking - generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at $z \gtrsim 7$ as suggested by JWST data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarly to electromagnetic (EM) signals, gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies can also affect gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we estimate the strong-lensing rate of massive black hole mergers observed with LISA. Given the uncertainties in the source populations as well as in the population of galaxies at high redshift, we consider: six different source population models, including light and heavy seeds, as well as three lens population models, including redshift-independent and redshift-dependent evolution properties. Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events. Out of all the detectable strong-lensed events, up to 61% (in the light-seed scenario) and 1% (in the heavy-seed scenario) of them are above the detectability threshold solely due to strong lensing effects and would otherwise be undetectable. For detectable pairs of strong-lensed events by galaxy lenses, we also find between 72%-81% of them to have time delays from 1 week to 1 year.</description>

Abstract: We examine the potential improvements in constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\Omega_M$ from using clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. We quantify the relative improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i) there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\pm 0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering information is more important for the matter density, with $\sigma(\Omega_M)$ reduced by factors of $1.068 \pm 007$ to $1.145 \pm 0.012$. The improvement in $w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \pm 0.041$ and $1.340 \pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys, self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We perform a full-sky, covariance-weighted quantification of redshift-frame systematics in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample with the explicit goal of determining whether such effects can meaningfully bias the inferred Hubble constant. Using 1,543 unique SNe with heliocentric and CMB-frame redshifts, we detect statistically significant but physically small residuals: a monopole offset $\langle z_{\rm CMB} - z_{\rm HEL}\rangle = (-3.8 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-4}$ and a kinematic dipole with amplitude $A = (1.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-3}$ aligned to within $1^\circ$ of the CMB dipole. When propagated through the full Pantheon+ STAT+SYS covariance matrix, these residuals shift the inferred Hubble constant by only $\Delta H_0 = 0.07~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$, corresponding to about $1%$ of the present $5$--$6~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$ Hubble tension. This shows that redshift-frame inconsistencies in Pantheon+ cannot contribute more than a percent-level fraction of the $H_0$ discrepancy. We therefore rule out a class of proposed explanations attributing the Hubble tension to SN redshift-frame errors.</description>

      <title>DESI-Like Hubble Expansion From Staged Symmetry Breaking</title>

Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release shows a moderate preference for dark energy with a time-varying equation of state parameter, suggesting that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model may need to be revised. In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a realization of that idea which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $\Lambda$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the evaporation of black holes immersed in a de Sitter environment, using the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime. The role of cosmological observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non-stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. The results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, with specific results for primordial black holes (PBHs). The timescale of evaporation is shown to depend significantly on the choice of cosmological observer and can differ substantially from predictions based on stationary models at late times. Deviations are also shown with respect to the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are completing their evaporation process at the present epoch.</description>

      <title>Gauge hierarchy and metastability from Higgs-driven crunching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new solution to the Higgs hierarchy problem based on dynamical vacuum selection in a landscape scanning the Higgs mass. In patches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs potential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This causes a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape. Conversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a critical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the standard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the instability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its running. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass hinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study two simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in the singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system. We show that the relevant parts of their parameter spaces can be probed by proposed future colliders, such as the FCC-ee or a muon collider.</description>

      <title>Null energy condition violation and beyond Horndeski physics in light of DESI DR2 data</title>

Abstract: Inflation and dark energy (DE), both featuring accelerated expansion, are crucial components of modern cosmology. As indicated by singularity theorems, null energy condition (NEC) violation is essential for resolving the initial singularity of inflation. The latest DESI DR2 results show that the DE equation of state evolves from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ at redshift $z \lesssim 1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ today, reinforcing interest in testing NEC violation in the observable Universe. Within a unified effective field theory framework that applies to both inflation and DE, we use DESI DR2 data and a non-parametric reconstruction approach to test, for the first time, the ``beyond Horndeski'' physics known to support fully stable NEC violation in nonsingular cosmology. Therefore, our work provides a novel avenue to constrain the physics underlying NEC violation in a model agnostic way. It also highlights the potential relevance of NEC violation to both the primordial Universe and late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era</title>

Abstract: Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 27,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80%. REGALADE is more than 90% complete for galaxies contributing 50% of the total $r$-band luminosity out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyper-luminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is one of the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in galactic environments probed by Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FRBs constitute a unique probe of various astrophysical and cosmological environments via their characteristic dispersion and rotation (RM) measures that encode information about the ionized gas traversed by the FRB sightlines. In this work, we analyse observed RM measured for 14 localized FRBs at $0.05 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, to infer total magnetic fields in various galactic environments. Additionally, we calculate $f_{\rm gas}$ - the average fraction of halo baryons in the ionized CGM. We build a spectroscopic dataset of FRB foreground galaxy halos, acquired with VLT/MUSE and FLIMFLAM survey. We develop a novel Bayesian algorithm and use it to correlate the individual intervening halos with the observed RM. This approach allows us to disentangle the magnetic fields present in various environments traversed by the FRB. Our analysis yields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in the ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground galaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is $B_{\rm host}^{\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\mu{\rm G}$. Additionally, we place upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\rm host}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.81\mu{\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos, $B_{\rm f/g}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.31\mu{\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average fraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \lesssim \log_{10} \left( M_{\rm halo} / M_{\odot}\right) \lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We find that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with previous measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs and have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or FRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of RM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples.</description>

      <title>Recovering unbiased CMB polarization maps using modern ground-based experiments with minimal assumptions about atmospheric emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of unbiased reconstruction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps from data collected by modern ground-based observatories. Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in such experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We consider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized atmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly implemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each focal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical down-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing (PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the same focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case where the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show that PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general assumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the absence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise variations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse than the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it requires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD performance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking atmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain mismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive, robust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without atmospheric modeling.</description>

      <title>Vz-GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at z=1-6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of Vz-GAL, a high-redshift CO(J=1-0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 Herschel-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-J CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array z-GAL survey. We successfully detect CO(J=1-0) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\sigma - 3\sigma$ significance, and CO(J=2-1) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO(J=1-0) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~(\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$ Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of "excitation correction" factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in 'gas mass$-$star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.</description>

      <title>A Limit on the Total Lepton Number in the Universe from BBN and the CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At temperatures below the QCD phase transition, any substantial lepton number in the Universe can only be present within the neutrino sector. In this work, we systematically explore the impact of a non-vanishing lepton number on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Relying on our recently developed framework based on momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations for the neutrino density matrix, we solve the full BBN reaction network to obtain the abundances of primordial elements. We find that the maximal primordial total lepton number $L$ allowed by BBN and the CMB is $-0.12 \,(-0.10) \leq L \leq 0.13\,(0.12) $ for NH (IH), while specific flavor directions can be even more constrained. This bound is complementary to the limits obtained from avoiding baryon overproduction through sphaleron processes at the electroweak phase transition since, although numerically weaker, it applies at lower temperatures and is obtained completely independently. We publicly release the C++ code COFLASY-C on GitHub which solves for the evolution of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations numerically.</description>

Abstract: We present a search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, planetary-mass ultra-compact binaries using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. Finding no evidence of such systems, we determine the maximum distance reach for such objects and their merger rate densities, independently of how they could have formed. Then, we identify classes of primordial black-hole mass distributions for which these rate limits can be translated into relevant constraints on the mass distribution of primordial black holes, assuming that they compose all of dark matter, in the mass range $[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\odot$. Our constraints are consistent with existing microlensing results in the planetary-mass range, and provide a complementary probe to sub-solar mass objects.</description>
