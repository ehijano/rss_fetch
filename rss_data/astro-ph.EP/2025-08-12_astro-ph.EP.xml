      <title>The Impact of External Radiation on the Inner Disk Chemistry of Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of young stars hosting planet-forming disks exist within clustered environments, like the Orion Nebula, implying that seemingly `extreme' UV environments (10^4 G_0 and above) are not so atypical in the context of planet formation. Using thermo-chemical modeling, we explore how the temperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star is impacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to heating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H_2, and atomic processes and as a result the area in which molecules exist in the ice-phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1AU the chemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere becomes more H2O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily well within 1AU of the disk, thus their abundance and distribution is not impacted by the UV field, up to a 10^6 G0. The products of photodissociation and photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV background field strength beyond 1AU, impacting the chemistry near the midplane. Effectively a `reset' chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of atoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas-phase. Planets that form in highly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in the gas and ice-phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the UV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (~10^6 G_0).</description>

      <title>Quantifying thermal water dissociation in the dayside photosphere of WASP-121 b using NIRPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense stellar irradiation of ultra-hot Jupiters results in some of the most extreme atmospheric environments in the planetary regime. On their daysides, temperatures can be sufficiently high for key atmospheric constituents to thermally dissociate into simpler molecular species and atoms. This dissociation drastically changes the atmospheric opacities and, in turn, critically alters the temperature structure, atmospheric dynamics, and day-night heat transport. To this date, however, simultaneous detections of the dissociating species and their thermally dissociation products in exoplanet atmospheres have remained rare. Here we present the simultaneous detections of H$_2$O and its thermally dissociation product OH on the dayside of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121 b based on high-resolution emission spectroscopy with the recently commissioned Near InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS). We retrieve a photospheric abundance ratio of log$_{10}$(OH/H$_2$O) $= -0.15\pm{0.20}$ indicating that there is about as much OH as H$_2$O at photospheric pressures, which confirms predictions from chemical equilibrium models. We compare the dissociation on WASP-121 b with other ultra-hot Jupiters and show that a trend in agreement with equilibrium models arises. We also discuss an apparent velocity shift of $4.79^{+0.93}_{-0.97} $km s$^{-1}$ in the H$_2$O signal, which is not reproduced by current global circulation models. Finally, in addition to H$_2$O and OH, the NIRPS data reveal evidence of Fe and Mg, from which we infer a Fe/Mg ratio consistent with the solar and host star ratios. Our results demonstrate that NIRPS can be an excellent instrument to obtain simultaneous measurements of refractory and volatile molecular species, paving the way for many future studies on the atmospheric composition, chemistry, and the formation history of close-in exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Analytical estimates for heliocentric escape of satellite ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general analytic framework to assess whether impact ejecta launched from the surface of a satellite can escape the gravitational influence of the planet--satellite system and enter heliocentric orbit. Using a patched-conic approach and defining the transition to planetocentric space via the Hill sphere or sphere of influence, we derive thresholds for escape in terms of the satellite-to-planet mass ratio and the ratio of the satellite's orbital speed to its escape speed. We identify three dynamical regimes for ejecta based on residual speed and launch direction. We complement this analysis with the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), deriving a necessary escape condition from the Jacobi integral at $\mathrm{L_{2}}$ and showing that it is consistent with the patched-conic thresholds. Applying our model to the Earth--Moon system reveals that all three outcomes--bound, conditional, and unbound--are accessible within a narrow range of launch speeds. This behavior is not found in other planetary satellite systems, but may occur in some binary asteroids. The framework also shows that the Moon's tidal migration has not altered its propensity to produce escaping ejecta, reinforcing the plausibility of a lunar origin for some near-Earth asteroids.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion radio observations of comet 12P/Pons-Brooks with Tianma radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {The multiple outburst events of comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during its 2024 apparition offer a unique window into highly-active volatile releasing processes not observable during quiescent periods. We performed radio observations of comet 12P/Pons-Brooks with the Tianma-65m radio telescope, targeting the OH and NH$_3$ inversion lines at 18-cm and 1.3-cm, respectively. By monitoring 12P at different heliocentric distances on its inbound journey, we aim to provide insights into the comet's volatile composition and outburst behavior. Four observations were carried out between December 2023 and March 2024 when the comet was approaching the Sun from 2.22 AU to 1.18 AU. We conducted 18-cm OH lines observations on 4 single days using the cryogenically cooled receiver system of the telescope to derive $\rm H_{2}O$ production rate. During 12P's outburst on December 14, we also conducted observations targeting the $\rm NH_{3}$ emission. OH 18-cm lines were clearly detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$4$\sigma$ (peak intensity). A tentative detection of $\rm NH_{3}$ was made at the $\sim$$3\sigma$ level during the outburst phase, but the detection needs to be further verified. Our observations provide information on the outgassing behavior of 12P/Pons-Brooks during its 2024 apparition. The water production rate of 12P, derived from the 18-cm OH lines is consistent with measurements obtained in other works. The possible detection of $\rm NH_{3}$ during an outburst suggests possible connections between subsurface volatile reservoir and the outburst mechanism. These results could further our understanding of the composition and activity of Halley-type comets.</description>

      <title>Planets Around Solar Twins/Analogs (PASTA) II: chemical abundances, systematic offsets, and clues to planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Previous studies have suggested that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to other solar twins or analogs, potentially as a result of planet formation. However, such conclusions are often limited by inhomogeneous samples and a lack of direct comparison with stars known to host planets.
  Aims. We aim to perform a homogeneous and precise abundance analysis of solar twins and analogs that host planets, to investigate possible chemical signatures associated with planet formation.
  Methods. We obtain high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio Magellan/MIKE spectra for 25 solar-like stars, including 22 confirmed or candidate planet hosts and three comparison stars. Stellar parameters and elemental abundances for 23 elements (from C to Eu) are derived through a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun.
  Results. Our sample spans [Fe/H] = -0.23 to +0.18 dex and includes 20 solar analogs, six of which are solar twins. Typical abundance uncertainties range from 0.01 to 0.05 dex for lighter elements (e.g., Fe, Si, C, O, Na) and up to 0.1 dex for neutron-capture elements. The Sun is consistently depleted in refractory elements relative to all solar analogs and twins, regardless of planet type. Stars hosting small planets tentatively show slightly stronger refractory element depletion than those hosting giant planets, though the difference is not yet statistically significant.
  Conclusions. We emphasize the need for strictly differential, line-by-line analyses relative to the Sun, as well as careful consideration of systematic differences between instruments, to ensure consistency and the homogeneity required to achieve our goals.</description>

      <title>A tunable Monte Carlo method for mixing correlated-k opacities. PRAS: polynomial reconstruction and sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately accounting for mixed-gas opacities is critical for radiative-transfer (RT) calculations in sub-stellar atmospheres. To produce the total k-coefficients of an arbitrary mixture of gases and their associated volume mixing ratios (VMRs), several methods are applied in the literature with various levels of overall accuracy and ease of computation. We propose a simple, tunable random overlap method, polynomial reconstruction and sampling (PRAS). PRAS is a Monte Carlo-based technique, sampling polynomial approximations of the opacity cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a wavelength band for each species requiring mixing. The method enables control over the end accuracy of the opacity mixture through choices in CDF fitting and number of random samples used in the mixing scheme. We find PRAS is typically as accurate, or more accurate, than other methods at recovering individual, pre-mixed k-coefficients. In an emission spectrum comparison test, PRAS, even with a small number of samples (100), is within ~2% of the reference 16+16 Legendre quadrature node random overlap with resorting and rebinning (RORR) results, and is typically more accurate than the 4+4 and 8+8 Legendre node schemes. In the vertical flux and heating rate tests, we also find that PRAS is generally more accurate than other schemes, and an improvement over the adaptive equivalent extinction (AEE) method. Overall, our current tests show PRAS is a generally viable alternative for the calculation of randomly overlapped opacities, especially in scenarios where increased accuracy of the RT calculation is required and when larger numbers of quadrature points are used. PRAS may therefore provide a benefit in performance and accuracy for high-precision retrieval modelling of JWST data.</description>

      <title>The impact of organic hazes and graphite on the observation of CO2-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many sub-Neptune and super-Earth exoplanets are expected to develop metal-enriched atmospheres due to atmospheric loss processes such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Thermochemical equilibrium calculations predict that at high metallicity and a temperature range of 300-700 K, CO2 becomes the dominant carbon species, and graphite may be the thermodynamically favored condensate under low-pressure conditions. Building on prior laboratory findings that such environments yield organic haze rather than graphite, we measured the transmittance spectra of organic haze analogues and graphite samples, and computed their optical constants across the measured wavelength range from 0.4 to 25 {\mu}m. The organic haze exhibits strong vibrational absorption bands, notably at 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 {\mu}m, while graphite shows featureless broadband absorption. The derived optical constants of haze and graphite provide the first dataset for organic haze analogues formed in CO2-rich atmospheres and offer improved applicability over prior graphite data derived from bulk reflectance or ellipsometry. We implemented these optical constants into the Virga and PICASO cloud and radiative transfer models to simulate transit spectra for GJ 1214b. The synthetic spectra with organic hazes reproduce the muted spectral features in the NIR observed by Hubble and general trends observed by JWST for GJ 1214b, while graphite models yield flat spectra across the observed wavelengths. This suggests haze features may serve as observational markers of carbon-rich atmospheres, whereas graphite's opacity could lead to radius overestimation, offering a possible explanation for super-puff exoplanets. Our work supplies essential optical to infrared data for interpreting observations of CO2-rich exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The reflex instability: exponential growth of a large-scale $m=1$ mode in astrophysical discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the finding of a linear, non-axisymmetric, global instability in gas discs around stars, which may be relevant to other astrophysical discs. It takes the form of an $m=1$ mode that grows in the disc density distribution while the star-barycentre distance rises exponentially with a characteristic timescale that is orders of magnitude longer than the orbital period. We present results of hydrodynamical simulations with various codes and numerical methods, using either barycentric or stellocentric reference frames, with or without the disc's self gravity: all simulations consistently show an unstable mode growing exponentially.
  The instability disappears if, and only if, the reflex motion of the star due to the disc's asymmetry is not taken into account in the simulations. For this reason we refer to this instability as the reflex instability. We identify a feedback loop as a possible origin, whereby the acceleration of the star excites the eccentricity of the disc, yielding an $m=1$ mode in the density distribution which, in turn, pulls the star. The growth timescale of the instability decreases with increasing disc mass and is a few hundred orbits for disc-to-star mass ratios of a few percent. If truly physical, and not due to a numerical artifact that would be common to all the codes we have employed, the reflex instability could have a dramatic impact on protoplanetary discs evolution and planetary formation.</description>

      <title>Do Rocky Planets around M Stars Have Atmospheres? A Statistical Approach to the Cosmic Shoreline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering the question "do rocky exoplanets around M stars have atmospheres?" is a key science goal of the JWST mission, with 500 hours of Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) awarded to address it. Theoretically, the so-called "Cosmic Shoreline" may not hold around M stars due to their harsher XUV environment, possibly resulting in most rocky planets lacking significant atmospheres -- a hypothesis that remains to be statistically tested through judicious target selection. We identify target selection as a combinatorial optimization problem ("knapsack problem"). We develop a statistical framework to test population-level hypotheses from observations and combine a formation and evolution model, 1D-RCE atmosphere model, and genetic algorithm to simulate populations and find the optimal set of observations. We find that, firstly, if all rocky planets around M stars are indeed bare rocks, JWST can efficiently place an upper bound on the atmosphere occurrence rates to less than 1 in 8, even without optimized target selection, but further improvements to the constraint are cost-prohibitive. Secondly, if the Cosmic Shoreline hypothesis (XUV or bolometric) holds true for M stars, strong evidence ($\Delta$BIC&gt;5) can be found within ~500 observing hours using the optimal strategy of a "wide and shallow" approach. Our statistical framework can be directly applied to upcoming observations to robustly identify the Cosmic Shoreline and to optimize target selection for determining other trends in exoplanet atmosphere observations, including those from future missions.</description>

      <title>Extreme Solar Storm Reveals Causal Interactions in Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar storms perturb Earth's magnetosphere, triggering geomagnetic storms that threaten space-based systems and infrastructure. Despite advances in spaceborne and ground-based observations, the causal chain driving solar-magnetosphere-ionosphere dynamics remains elusive due to multiphysics coupling, nonlinearity, and cross-scale complexity. This study presents an information-theoretic framework to decipher interaction mechanisms in extreme solar geomagnetic storms across intensity levels within space weather causal chains, using 1980-2024 datasets. Unexpectedly, we uncover auroral spatial causality patterns associated with space weather threats in the Arctic during May 2024 extreme storms. By integrating causal consistency constraints into spatiotemporal modeling, SolarAurora outperforms existing frameworks, achieving superior accuracy in forecasting May/October 2024 events. These results advance understanding of space weather dynamics and establish a promising framework for scientific discovery and forecasting extreme space weather events.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XXII: Keplerian disk, disk structures and jets/outflows in the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ALMA observations of the Class 0 protostar IRAS 04166+2706, obtained as part of the ALMA large program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). These observations were made in the 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular lines at angular resolutions of $\sim 0.05''$ ($\sim 8$ au) and $\sim 0.16''$ ($\sim25$ au), respectively. The continuum emission shows a disk-like structure with a radius of $\sim22$ au. Kinematical analysis of $^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$), CH$_3$OH (4$_2$-3$_1$) emission demonstrates that these molecular lines trace the infalling-rotating envelope and possibly a Keplerian disk, enabling us to estimate the protostar mass to be $0.15 \rm{M_\odot} &lt; \rm{M_\star} &lt; 0.39 M_\odot$. The dusty disk is found to exhibit a brightness asymmetry along its minor axis in the continuum emission, probably caused by a flared distribution of the dust and the high optical depth of the dust emission. In addition, the CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) emissions show knotty and wiggling motions in the jets. Our high angular resolution observations revealed the most recent mass ejection events, which have occurred within the last $\sim 25$ years.</description>

      <title>Solar Flux Atlases: The new HARPS-N Quiet Sun Benchmark and Ca II H &amp; K Lines Continuum Normalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H &amp; K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...</description>

      <title>Virtual Observatory and machine learning for the study of low-mass objects in photometric and spectroscopic surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass objects are ubiquitous in our Galaxy. Their low temperature provides them with complex atmospheres characterised by the presence of strong molecular absorption bands which, together with their faintness, have made their accurate characterisation a great challenge for astronomers over the last decades. M dwarfs account for 75% of the census of stars within 10 pc of the Sun, and their suitability as targets in the search for Earth-like planets has led many research groups to focus on the study of these objects, which is crucial for the understanding of the structure and kinematics of our Galaxy. Very low-mass stars and substellar objects with spectral types M7 or later, including the extended L, T, and Y spectral types, constitute the domain of ultracool dwarfs. The study of these objects, discovered definitively in 1995, is key for understanding the boundary between stellar and substellar objects and promises to experience a quantum leap thanks to the characteristics of new-generation surveys such as Euclid or LSST.
  Data analysis in the field of observational astronomy has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decades driven by an exponential growth in the volume and complexity of available data. In this revolution, the Virtual Observatory has become a cornerstone providing a system that fosters interoperability between astronomical archives around the world. In response to this growth in data complexity, the astronomical community has increasingly adopted machine learning techniques for the development of scalable, automated solutions.
  This thesis explores the discovery and characterisation of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs, using data-driven approaches supported by Virtual Observatory technologies and protocols. We rely on a variety of machine and deep learning techniques to develop flexible methodologies aimed at advancing our understanding of low-mass objects.</description>

      <title>Biosignature false positives in potentially habitable planets around M dwarfs: the effect of UV radiation from one flare</title>

Abstract: Many past studies have predicted the steady-state production and maintenance of abiotic O$_2$ and O$_3$ in the atmospheres of CO$_2$-rich terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarf stars. However, the time-dependent responses of these planetary atmospheres to flare events - and the possible temporary production or enhancement of false positive biosignatures therein - has been comparatively less well studied. Most past works that have modeled the photochemical response to flares have assumed abundant free oxygen like that of the modern or Proterozoic Earth. Here we examine in detail the photochemical impact of the UV emitted by a single flare on abiotic O$_2$/O$_3$ production in prebiotic, CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres of M dwarf planets with CO$_2$ levels ranging from 10% to 90% of 1 bar. We find that a single flare generally destroys O$_2$ while modestly enhancing O$_3$ column densities. We simulate the spectral observables of both the steady-state atmosphere and time-dependent spectral response over the flare window for both emitted and transmitted light spectra. Over the course of the flare, the O$_3$ UV Hartley band is modestly enhanced by a maximum of 6 ppm while the CO$_2$ molecular transit depths modestly decline by 7 ppm. In both emitted and transmitted light spectra, the 9.65 $\mu$m O$_3$ band is hidden by the overlapping 9.4 $\mu$m CO$_2$ band for all scenarios considered. Overall, we find that the possible enhancements of abiotic O$_3$ due to a single flare are small compared to O$_3$'s sensitivity to other parameters such as CO$_2$ and H$_2$O abundances or the availability of reducing gases such as H$_2$.</description>

      <title>Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for planetary modeling with flow matching</title>

Abstract: Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing reliable equations of state of diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for mapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous methods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves -- which contain limited information about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits as probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map representation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of StarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for spot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data experiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar orientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle evolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method to TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot concentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based approach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing constraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of rotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet characterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from planetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic activity patterns.

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): III. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Lupus Star-forming Region</title>

Abstract: We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6 stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6 setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of $\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between $10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XII. Extreme millimetre variability detected in a Class II disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions. We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1) emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object, the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar surface or a strong accretion burst.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Architectures of Multiplanet Systems from Kepler, K2, and TESS Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanet surveys like Kepler, TESS, and K2 have shown that planetary systems are common in our galaxy. These surveys, along with several others, have identified thousands of planetary candidates, with more than five thousand having already been confirmed. Many of these planetary systems host multiple planets. As we discover more multiplanet systems, notable trends begin to appear in the data. We use kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyze the period ratios of adjacent planet pairs in multiplanet systems in the most recent Kepler, TESS and K2 data, paying particular attention to pairs in first order mean motion resonance (MMR). We compare a recent Kepler catalog with the DR25 data release. We also compare TESS and K2 against the latest Kepler catalog. To verify the significance of our findings against selection bias, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of multiplanet systems, finding an excess of planet pairs near the 2.2, 2 (2:1), and 1.5 (3:2) period ratios in the Kepler, K2, and TESS catalogs, all exceeding the 99% confidence interval when constrained to orbital periods less than 25 days. We identify two planet pairs orbiting M dwarf stars in a very tight ratio, as well as two likely misidentified planet pairs.</description>

      <title>Near-Discovery Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar Objects are comets and asteroids that formed around other stars but were ejected before they could accrete into exoplanets. They therefore represent a rare opportunity to compare the building blocks of planets in the Solar System to those in other stellar systems. The third Interstellar Object, 3I/ATLAS, is the newest, brightest, potentially largest, and fastest member of this population. We report observations of 3I/ATLAS taken on 2025 July 3 and 4 with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility just days after its discovery. In r'-band imaging with 'Opihi, we see no obvious lightcurve variability and derive a g'-i' color of 0.98+/-0.03 which is consistent in spectral slope to other near-discovery observations. We obtained the first near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectrum of 3I/ATLAS with SpeX. The visible color and NIR spectrum show a linear, red visible slope, a somewhat less red slope between 0.7 and 1.1 $\mu{m}$, and a neutral or slightly blue slope at longer wavelengths. Challenges in modeling the reflectivity of 3I may indicate that this comet has a complex grain size distribution, grain compositions unlike Solar system comets, or both. Like 2I/Borisov, there are no obvious signatures of water ice in the coma of 3I/ATLAS. Observations closer to perihelion will help elucidate whether 3I has less water than anticipated or whether the Interstellar Objects might retain and release their ices somewhat differently than Solar System comets do.</description>

      <title>Precovery Observations of 3I/ATLAS from TESS Suggests Possible Distant Activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third macroscopic interstellar object detected traversing the Solar System. Since its initial discovery on UT 01 July 2025, hundreds of hours on a range of observational facilities have been dedicated to measure the physical properties of this object. These observations have provided astrometry to refine the orbital solution, photometry to measure the color, a rotation period and secular light curve, and spectroscopy to characterize the composition of the coma. Here, we report precovery photometry of 3I/ATLAS as observed with NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 3I/ATLAS was observed nearly continuously by TESS from UT 07 May 2025 to 02 June 2025. We use the shift-stack method to create deep stack images to recover the object. These composite images reveal that 3I/ATLAS has an average TESS magnitude of $T_\textrm{mag} = 20.83 \pm 0.05, 19.28 \pm 0.05$ and an absolute visual magnitude of $H_V = 13.72 \pm 0.35; 12.52 \pm 0.35$, the latter being consistent with magnitudes reported in July 2025. When coupled with recent HST images deriving a nucleus size of R$&lt;$2.8 km (H$&gt;$15.4), our measurements suggest that 3I/ATLAS may have been active out at $\sim 6$ au. Additionally, we extract a $\sim 20$ day light curve and find no statistically significant evidence of a nucleus rotation period. Nevertheless, the data presented here are some of the earliest precovery images of 3I/ATLAS and may be used in conjunction with future observations to constrain the properties of our third interstellar interloper.</description>

      <title>Mission Analysis for the HENON CubeSat Mission to a Large Sun-Earth Distant Retrograde Orbit</title>

Abstract: The HEliospheric pioNeer for sOlar and interplanetary threats defeNce (HENON) mission is a CubeSat Space Weather mission, designed to operate in a Sun-Earth Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) at more than 10 million km from Earth. HENON will embark payloads tailored for Space Weather (SWE) observations: a high-resolution energetic particle radiation monitor, a Faraday cup, and a magnetometer, enabling quasi-real-time monitoring of interplanetary conditions in deep space. HENON has multiple objectives, such as demonstrating CubeSat capabilities in deep space, including long-duration electric propulsion with periodic telemetry and command, and robust attitude control for deep-space operations. It will pave the way for a future fleet of spacecraft on DROs, providing continuous near real-time measurements for SWE forecasting. This paper focuses on the mission analysis performed for phases A and B, with the main goal of defining a baseline transfer trajectory to a heliocentric DRO in co-orbital motion with Earth. The proposed transfer leverages a rideshare opportunity on a mission escaping Earth gravity field, most likely one headed toward the Sun-Earth L2 region, and relies exclusively on on-board electric propulsion to reach deep space, making it a pioneering demonstration of this approach and the technology. Under appropriate assumptions on the electric propulsion system performance, spacecraft mass, and propellant budget, it is shown that the HENON target DRO can be reached in about one year, accounting also for periodic interruptions of thrusting to allow for telemetry, tracking, and command.</description>
