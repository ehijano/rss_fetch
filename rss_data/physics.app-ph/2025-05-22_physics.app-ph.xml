      <title>Improving Beam Granularity Performance of Reconfigurable Refelctarray Radars via Spatial Quantization and Phase Quantization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the impacts of spatial quantization and phase quantization on the beam granularity characteristic of reconfigurable reflectarray (RRA) radars are systematically investigated. From the perspective of the difference beam, a theoretical analysis is conducted to derive the factors influencing beam granularity. To validate the theoretical findings, simulations are performed under various quantization scenarios: specifically, 1-bit, 2-bit, and 3-bit spatial quantization with 1-bit phase quantization, as well as 1-bit, 2-bit, and 3-bit phase quantization with 1-bit spatial quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that both spatial quantization and phase quantization effectively reduce beam granularity in reconfigurable reflectarray radars, thereby enhancing the angular resolution of the beam. These findings offer valuable insights and practical reference for beam-tracking applications in radar and communications.</description>

      <title>Research on Core Loss of Direct-drive 75kW Tidal Current Generator Using Machine Learning and Multi-objective Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a classification of generator excitation waveforms using principal component analysis (PCA) and machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). Building upon the traditional Steinmetz equation, a temperature correction term is introduced. Through nonlinear regression and least squares parameter fitting, a novel temperature correction equation is proposed, which significantly reduces the prediction error for core losses under high-temperature conditions. The average relative error is decreased to 16.03%, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy. Using GBDT and random forest regression models, the independent and combined effects of temperature, excitation waveforms, and magnetic materials on core loss are analyzed. The results indicate that the excitation waveform has the most significant impact, followed by temperature, while the magnetic core material exhibits the least influence. The optimal combination for minimizing core loss is identified, achieving a core loss value of 35,310.9988 under the specified conditions. A data-driven predictive model for core loss is developed, demonstrating excellent performance with an R*R value of 0.9703 through machine learning regression analysis, indicating high prediction accuracy and broad applicability. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model considering both core loss and transmission magnetic energy is proposed. Genetic algorithms are employed for optimization, resulting in an optimal design scheme that minimizes core loss and maximizes transmission magnetic energy. Based on this model, the magnetic core compensation structure of a direct-drive 75kW tidal energy generator is optimized in practical applications, yielding satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Silicon photonics LMA amplifiers: High power, high gain, low noise and tunable polarization sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-power amplifiers are of great importance in many optical systems deployed in optical sensing, ranging, medical surgery, material processing and more. Likewise, high-gain, low-noise amplifiers with low polarization dependence are critical components of long-range optical communication systems. Integrated photonic solutions show great potential in challenging application fields thanks to their drastic reduction in size, weight and cost, but this comes at the expense of low optical power due to reduced energy storage capacity in small devices. Recently, the large mode area (LMA) technology, which is well known for dramatically increasing the output power of fiber amplifiers by orders of magnitude, has been brought to the chip-level. With a large optical mode in the gain medium, the energy storage capacity and saturation power are increased significantly, allowing for high-power amplification with watt-level output power directly from the chip. In this work we demonstrate that a single integrated LMA amplifier is capable of both high-power amplification up to 800 mW with output saturation powers &gt; 115 mW as well as high small-signal net gain up to 30 dB and low-noise amplification with noise figures &lt; 4 dB. The LMA design further allows for a tuning of the polarization dependent gain (PDG) by adjusting the pump power and pump polarization, making it possible to completely nullify the polarization-sensitivity for any given signal power from the {\mu}W to mW-level. The power and noise performance achieved surpasses the performance level of many integrated amplifiers and fiber-based amplifiers. We believe that the tunability of the PDG combined with high gain and low noise figure can play a disruptive role for next-generation integrated amplifiers in telecommunication networks.</description>

      <title>Self-powered smart contact lenses: a multidisciplinary approach to micro-scale energy and 900 MHz - 1.1 GHz bandwidth microfabricated loop antennas communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart contact lenses are at the forefront of integrating microelectronics, biomedical engineering, and optics into wearable technologies. This work addresses a key obstacle in their development: achieving autonomous power without compromising safety or miniaturization. We examine energy harvesting strategies using intrinsic ocular sources-particularly tear salinity and eyelid motion-to enable sustainable operation without external batteries. The study emphasizes compact loop antennas operating between 900 MHz and 1.1 GHz as critical for wireless data transmission and power management. Material choices, signal integrity, and biocompatibility are also discussed. By presenting recent advances in 3D-printed optics, antenna integration, and energy systems, we propose a conceptual framework for the next generation of smart lenses, enabling real-time health monitoring and vision enhancement through self-powered, compact devices.</description>

      <title>State Characterisation of Self-Directed Channel Memristive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowing how to reliably use memristors as information storage devices is crucial not only to their role as emerging memories, but also for their application in neural network acceleration and as components of novel neuromorphic systems. In order to better understand the dynamics of information storage on memristors, it is essential to be able to characterise and measure their state. To this end, in this paper we propose a general, physics-inspired modelling approach for characterising the state of self-directed channel (SDC) memristors. Additionally, to enable the identification of the proposed state from device data, we introduce a noise-aware approach to the minimum-variance estimation of the state from voltage and current pairs.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Characterization of the Resonator in the Chinese Transverse Flute (dizi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dizi is a traditional Chinese transverse flute and is most distinguished from the western flute by the presence of a hole covered by a wrinkled membrane. In this study, we analyze the linear acoustical behavior of the dizi resonator through a detailed acoustical model that incorporates drilled toneholes, back end-holes, membrane hole, and upstream embouchure hole. The input admittance of the dizi is measured and modeled using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) and Transfer Matrix Method with external Interactions (TMMI). In comparison to measurements, the TMMI is shown to more accurately model the dizi than the TMM when compared to measurements. Our analysis reveals that attaching the membrane shifts admittance peaks to lower frequencies, reduces their magnitude, and influences tuning and harmonicity for different peaks and fingerings. The study further shows that the upstream branch, which includes the embouchure hole, complicates the evaluation of the tonehole lattice cutoff frequency, suggesting that it may not need to be considered for flute instruments. Cutoff frequencies exhibit distinct groupings across fingerings, influenced by the different tonehole lattices in the dizi: finger-hole lattice and end-hole lattice.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional magnetization switching of a ferrimagnetic insulator with monochiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that magnetization switching in ferromagnets can be achieved through adsorbing chiral molecules on the surface without the need for current or external magnetic fields, offering a low-power mechanism for applications in spintronic devices. Opposite chirality molecules cause opposite direction reversals of magnetization through the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate bidirectional magnetization switching in thin films of ferrimagnetic insulator TmIG using a single chirality molecule - a Cu metallopolymer of d-leucine. Through UV-VIS circular dichroism and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we determined that switching between different magnetic orientations is associated with interactions of the d-leucine with the two distinct sublattices of the Fe ions in the TmIG, at octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Our study demonstrates the unexpected versatility of the CISS mechanism for magnetization switching in ferrimagnets using single chirality materials, thereby expanding the potential applications of chiral molecule adsorption-induced magnetization flipping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy-Based Models have emerged as a powerful framework in the realm of generative modeling, offering a unique perspective that aligns closely with principles of statistical mechanics. This review aims to provide physicists with a comprehensive understanding of EBMs, delineating their connection to other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and Normalizing Flows. We explore the sampling techniques crucial for EBMs, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and draw parallels between EBM concepts and statistical mechanics, highlighting the significance of energy functions and partition functions. Furthermore, we delve into recent training methodologies for EBMs, covering recent advancements and their implications for enhanced model performance and efficiency. This review is designed to clarify the often complex interconnections between these models, which can be challenging due to the diverse communities working on the topic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies phase retrieval for wave fields, aiming to recover the phase of an incoming wave from multi-plane intensity measurements behind different types of linear and nonlinear media. We show that unique phase retrieval can be achieved by utilizing intensity data produced by multiple media. This uniqueness does not require prescribed boundary conditions for the phase in the incidence plane, in contrast to existing phase retrieval methods based on the transport of intensity equation. Moreover, the uniqueness proofs lead to explicit phase reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the theory.</description>

Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>
