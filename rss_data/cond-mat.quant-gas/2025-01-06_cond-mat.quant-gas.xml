      <title>Out-of-equilibrium dynamical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates in a ramped up weak disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study how the superfluid and condensate deformation of a weakly interacting ultracold Bose gas evolve during the ramp-up of an external weak disorder potential. Both resulting deformations turn out to consist of two distinct contributions, namely a reversible equilibrium one, already predicted by Huang and Meng in 1992, and a nonequilibrium dynamical one, whose magnitude depends on the details of the ramping protocol. For the specific case of the exponential ramp-up protocol, we are able to derive analytical time-dependent expressions for the above quantities. After a sufficiently long time, a steady state emerges that is generically out of equilibrium. We take the first step in investigating its properties by studying its relaxation dynamics. In addition, we analyze the two-time correlation function and elucidate its relation to the equilibrium and the dynamical part of the condensate deformation.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moir\'e potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic topological and correlated phases induced by moir\'e potentials have recently been explored in 2D twisted bilayer graphene systems. Here we investigate spin-$1/2$ interacting fermionic atoms in the 1D moir\'e optical superlattice formed by the superposition of two commensurate potentials. We reveal the reentrant topological phases and periodic-moir\'e-spin density wave (PM-SDW) of the ground states in both non-interacting and interacting cases. The reentrant topological phases are driven by the moir\'e potential with the sequent trivial-topological-trivial-topological-trivial transition. The critical exponent of topological transitions and the localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates are studied. The PM-SDW order of the many-body ground state is contributed from the moir\'e potential, and is enhanced by the on-site interaction but suppressed by the nearest-neighbor interaction. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moir\'e systems, which might be experimentally realized with ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Energy spectra and fluxes of two-dimensional turbulent quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the energy spectra and associated fluxes of turbulent two-dimensional quantum droplets subjected to a rotating paddling potential which is removed after a few oscillation periods. A systematic analysis on the impact of the characteristics (height and velocity) of the rotating potential and the droplet atom number reveals the emergence of different dynamical response regimes. These are classified by utilizing the second-order sign correlation function and the ratio of incompressible versus compressible kinetic energies. They involve, vortex configurations ranging from vortex dipoles to vortex clusters and randomly distributed vortex-antivortex pairs. The incompressible kinetic energy spectrum features Kolmogorov ($k^{-5/3}$) and Vinen like ($k^{-1}$) scaling in the infrared regime, while a $k^{-3}$ decay in the ultraviolet captures the presence of vortices. The compressible spectrum shows $k^{-3/2}$ scaling within the infrared and $k$ power law in the case of enhanced sound-wave emission suggesting thermalization. Significant distortions are observed in the droplet periphery in the presence of a harmonic trap. A direct energy cascade (from large to small length scales) is mainly identified through the flux. Our findings offer insights into the turbulent response of exotic phases-of-matter, featuring quantum fluctuations, and may inspire investigations aiming to unravel self-similar nonequilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

      <title>A stable phase-locking-free single beam optical lattice with multiple configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices formed by interfering laser beams are widely used to trap and manipulate atoms for quantum simulation, metrology, and computation. To stabilize optical lattices in experiments, it is usually challenging to implement delicate phase-locking systems with complicated optics and electronics to reduce the relative phase fluctuation of multiple laser beams. Here we report a phase-locking-free scheme to implement optical lattices by passing a single laser beam through a prism with n-fold symmetric facets and large apex angles. The scheme ensures a stable optical lattice since the interference occurs among different deflected parts of a single laser beam without any moving component. Various lattice configurations, including a triangular lattice and a quasi-crystal lattice with ten-fold symmetry are demonstrated. In both cases, stability measurements show a change of lattice constant in less than 1.14%, and a drift of lattice position in less than 1.61%.</description>

      <title>Universality class of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate far from equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale invariance and self-similarity in physics provide a unified framework to classify phases of matter and dynamical properties near equilibrium in both classical and quantum systems. This paradigm has been further extended to isolated many-body quantum systems driven far from equilibrium, where physical observables exhibit dynamical scaling with universal scaling exponents. Universal dynamics appear in a wide range of scenarios, including cosmology, quark-gluon matter, ultracold atoms, and quantum spin magnets. However, how universal dynamics depend on the symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian in nonequilibrium systems remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we report on the classification of universal coarsening dynamics in a quenched two-dimensional ferromagnetic spinor Bose gas. We observe spatiotemporal scaling of spin correlation functions with distinguishable scaling exponents that characterize binary and diffusive fluids. The universality class of the coarsening dynamics is determined by the symmetry of the order parameter and the dynamics of the topological defects, such as domain walls and vortices. Our results provide a categorization of the universality classes of far from equilibrium quantum dynamics based on symmetry properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Phase-space localization at the lowest Landau level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider bosons with weak contact interactions in a harmonic trap and focus on states at the lowest Landau level. Motivated by the known nontrivial phase-space topography of the energy functional of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we explore Husimi distributions of quantum energy eigenstates in the classical phase space of the Schroedinger field. With interactions turned off, the energy levels are highly degenerate and the Husimi distributions do not manifest any particular localization properties. With interactions turned on, the degeneracy is lifted, and a selection of energy levels emerges whose Husimi distributions are localized around low-dimensional surfaces in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Honeycomb supersolid -- Dirac points and shear-instability induced crystal transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The honeycomb supersolid state is predicted to form in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate with a planar confining potential. Our results for its excitation spectrum reveal the gapless bands and the emergence of Dirac points at the Brillouin zone edge, manifesting as points where the second sound and transverse sound bands touch. The honeycomb supersolid has three sound speeds that we connect to its elastic parameters through hydrodynamic theory. From this analysis we find conditions where a shear instability occurs as the honeycomb rigidity disappears. This gives insight into the nonequilibrium dynamics following an interaction quench, where the honeycomb pattern melts and different crystal orders emerge.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes equations for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled $1d$ cold-atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. The exact simulation of these reactions is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. Here, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multispecies trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. By manipulating both the ground-state and optical qubits, we observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</description>
