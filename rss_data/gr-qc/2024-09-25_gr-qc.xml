      <title>Gravitational Waves and Black Hole perturbations in Acoustic Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present Master's thesis, I describe the research I conducted during my Master's program on the topic of analogue gravity. This line of research was initiated by Bill Unruh, who established an analogy between hydrodynamic flow with a supersonic region and black holes. One possibility to exploit this hydrodynamics/gravity analogy is to create analogue black holes within Bose-Einstein condensates. At low temperatures, phonons-low energy excitations-behave like a massless scalar field in an emergent acoustic metric determined by the condensate. An acoustic black hole is created by transonic fluid, and quantum fluctuations at the acoustic horizon lead to thermal radiation of phonons, akin to Hawking radiation. This emission has been numerically simulated and experimentally verified in Bose-Einstein condensates. The goal of my Master's thesis is to design a system in which an acoustic horizon is excited by a gravitational wave-like perturbation. The thesis is divided into two main parts: the first reviews essential topics of general relativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and analogue gravity; while the second presents my results. Firstly, I propose a method to reproduce a gravitational wave perturbation on a flat background acoustic metric emergent from a Bose-Einstein condensate. Secondly, I demonstrate how to implement an impinging gravitational wave-like perturbation at an acoustic horizon. I then analyze how the horizon responds to this analogue gravitational wave and discuss the implications of my work, including potential studies on shear viscosity and entropy density of the perturbed acoustic horizon. Notably, these interesting research directions could be explored in experiments conducted with ultra-cold quantum gas platforms.</description>

      <title>Hubble-Induced Phase Transitions: Gravitational-Wave Imprint of Ricci Reheating from Lattice Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer an unprecedented opportunity to look into the violent high-energy processes happening during the reheating phase of our Universe. We consider a Hubble-induced phase transition scenario as a source of a post-inflationary stochastic background of gravitational waves and analyse the main characteristics of its spectrum for the first time via numerical methods. The output of a large number of fully-fledged classical lattice simulations is condensed in a set of parametric formulas that describe key features of the gravitational wave spectrum, such as its peak amplitude and characteristic frequency, and avoid the need for further time-consuming simulations. The signal from such stochastic background is compared to the prospective sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Stability of the expanding region of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes and smoothness at the conformal boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the recent result by Fournodavlos-Schlue on the nonlinear stability of the expanding region of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes as solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant. Our gauge is a modification of a generalized harmonic gauge introduced by Ringstr\"om in which the asymptotic analysis becomes particularly simple. Due to the hyperbolic character of our gauge, our stability result is local near points on the conformal boundary. We show furthermore that, in yet another gauge, the conformally rescaled metric is smooth down to the future conformal boundary, with the coefficients of its Fefferman-Graham type asymptotic expansion featuring a mild singularity at future timelike infinity of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Van der Waals black hole within nonextensive Kaniadiakis entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the thermodynamic properties of the Van der Waals black hole in the framework of the nonextensive Kaniadakis entropy. We have shown that the black hole properties, such as the mass and temperature, differ from those obtained by using the the Boltzmann-Gibbs approach. Moreover, the nonextensivity \k{appa}-parameter changes behavior of the Gibbs free energy via introduced thermodynamic instabilities, whereas the emission rate is influenced by \k{appa} only at low frequencies. Nonetheless, the pressure-volume (P(V)) characteristics are found independent of \k{appa} and the entropy form, unlike in other anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole models. In summary, presented findings partially support previous arguments of Gohar and Salzano that under certain circumstances all entropic models are equivalent and indistinguishable [1].</description>

      <title>Gravitational Faraday Effect induced by Dark Matter Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spin of dark matter induces a gravitational analog of the electromagnetic Faraday effect, where the polarization of gravitational waves undergoes a rotation as they propagate through a dark matter halo with a non-vanishing axial spin tensor (hypermomentum). An expression for the gravitational rotation angle is provided, which is analogous to the Faraday rotation in optics, and evaluate its significance in astrophysical settings. Although the effect is expected to be small under current observational constraints, we discuss its potential importance in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes with electric and magnetic charges in general relativity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, static and spherically symmetric solutions of the general relativity coupled to linear/nonlinear electrodynamics and a dust fluid (GR-ED-DF) are studied. We demonstrate that these solutions can be categorized into two sets, both having an electromagnetically charged metric, but with the following conditions: (i) a variable redshift function, without a dust fluid as source, and (ii) a constant redshift function, with a dust fluid as source. Using (i), we provide a simple proof of the nonexistence of static and spherically symmetric traversable Morris-Thorne wormhole solutions with variable redshift functions in GR-ED-DF. Whereas using (ii), we construct several static and spherically symmetric traversable Morris-Thorne wormholes with constant redshift function in GR-ED-DF, where the source of gravity consists of a dust fluid having negative energy density and an electromagnetic field described by a physically reasonable model of linear/nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{F})$ depending only on the electromagnetic invariant $\mathcal{F}\!=\!F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}\!/4$, where $F_{\alpha\beta}$ are the components of the electromagnetic field tensor. We show that in the limit of the weak electromagnetic field, each of our solutions become a traversable wormhole of the electromagnetically charged Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole type. Additionally, we present a theorem that establishes when an electrically and magnetically charged Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, with null $\mathcal{F}$, can be supported by a GR-ED-DF theory.</description>

      <title>CMB and energy conservation limits on nanohertz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) in the nanohertz band, announced by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world, has been posited to be sourced by either a population of supermassive black holes binaries or perturbations of spacetime near the inflationary era, generated by a zoo of various new physical phenomena. Gravitational waves (GWs) from these latter models would be explained by extensions to the standard model of cosmology and possibly to the standard model of particle physics. While PTA datasets can be used to characterize the parameter spaces of these models, energy conservation and limits from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used $\textit{a priori}$ to bound those parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that taking a simple rule for energy conservation and using CMB bounds on the radiation energy density can set stringent limits on the parameters for these models.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing black hole stability in cubic vector Galileon theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a subclass of generalized Proca theories where a cubic vector Galileon term breaks the $U(1)$ gauge invariance, it is known that there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nonvanishing temporal and longitudinal vector components. Such hairy BHs are present for a vanishing vector-field mass ($m=0$) with a non-zero cubic Galileon coupling $\beta_3$. We study the linear stability of those hairy BHs by considering even-parity perturbations in the eikonal limit. In the angular direction, we show that one of the three dynamical perturbations has a nontrivial squared propagation speed $c_{\Omega,1}^2$, while the other two dynamical modes are luminal. We could detect two different unstable behaviors of perturbations in all the parameter spaces of hairy asymptotically flat BH solutions we searched for. In the first case, an angular Laplacian instability on the horizon is induced by negative $c_{\Omega,1}^2$. For the second case, it is possible to avoid this horizon instability, but in such cases, the positivity of $c_{\Omega,1}^2$ is violated at large distances. Hence these hairy BHs are generally prone to Laplacian instabilities along the angular direction in some regions outside the horizon. Moreover, we also encounter a pathological behavior of the radial propagation speeds $c_r$ possessing two different values of $c_r^2$ for one of the dynamical perturbations. Introducing the vector-field mass $m$ to cubic vector Galileons, however, we show that the resulting no-hair Schwarzschild BH solution satisfies all the linear stability conditions in the small-scale limit, with luminal propagation speeds of three dynamical even-parity perturbations.</description>

Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for a perfect fluid solution to define a spatially-homogeneous cosmology are achieved. These conditions are Intrinsic, Deductive, Explicit and ALgorithmic, and they offer an IDEAL labeling of these geometries. When a three-dimensional group acts on the three-dimensional space-like orbits, the Bianchi type of the model is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Choice of vacuum state and the relation between the inflationary and Planck scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations about the cosmic microwave background evidence a clear discrepancy between the scale of inflation and the Planck scale expected in the conventional inflationary picture, based on simple chaotic inflationary models. This paper explores a possible resolution of this conflict by considering a slight modification of the standard general relativity scenario, which naturally incorporates a cutoff scale consistent with the observations. This last scale of power suppression appears by the combined effect of the preinflationary background dynamics and an associated initial vacuum state for the cosmological perturbations which differs from the conventional Bunch-Davies state of slow-roll inflation. We revise and correct previous discussions in the literature about the relation between this scale and the scale corresponding to the onset of inflation. The mechanism that produces this cutoff is intimately related to the criterion determining a privileged vacuum state for the primordial perturbations. We adhere to a recent proposal based on an asymptotic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the perturbations and leading to a non-oscillatory primordial power spectrum. With this choice, we are able to investigate analytically the model, studying in detail some physically interesting cases. These analytic calculations provide further support to our arguments about the relation between the different scales of the system.</description>

      <title>A Cosmological Reconstruction of the Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple toy model of cosmic acceleration driven purely by a self-interacting scalar field embedded in theory of grand unification. The scalar self-interaction is Higgs-like and provokes a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The coefficient of the quadratic term in the self-interaction potential has an evolution and it leads to a cosmic variation of proton-to-electron mass ratio, $\mu$. We perform a cosmological reconstruction from the kinematic parameter jerk and discuss a few cosmological consequences of the theory. We also compare the theoretically calculated $\mu$ variation with the observations of molecular absorption spectra from Cesium Atomic Clock data.</description>

      <title>Removing spurious degrees of freedom from EFT of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the effective field theory approach to gravity, the Lagrangian density for general relativity is supplemented by generally covariant terms of higher order in the Riemann tensor and its derivatives. At face value, these terms will result in higher derivative equations of motion and additional degrees of freedom beyond those of general relativity. This is seemingly at odds with the goal of effective field theory which is to encode ultraviolet corrections in terms of existing low energy degrees of freedom. Here we apply an action-based procedure for the removal of spurious degrees of freedom for the case of general relativity supplemented by a term cubic in the Riemann tensor. To the order we work in, the resulting reduced theory takes the form of minimally modified gravity, which is a class of modified gravity theories that propagate just the massless spin-2 graviton, but exhibit a preferred frame at short distances due to a deformation of time diffeomorphisms. Our work suggests that this class of theories can be understood as an effective theory of gravity, capturing effects of unknown ultraviolet physics.</description>

      <title>Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? In this work we study a low-mass-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles can form mirror atoms and hadrons and all these stable particles can comprise a large part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. Such a phase transition can generate stochastic gravitational waves that can be detected by the future gravitational wave experiments. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the SKA. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula. We assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect which indicates that hydrogen is always in correlation with dark matter, and hydrogen gas is strongly present in the guitar nebula.</description>

      <title>Non-singular cosmological scenarios in scalar-tensor theories and their stability: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives a concise overview of the development and current status of studies on healthy models of the early Universe without an initial singularity, namely the cosmological bounce and Genesis scenarios, constructed within a broad class of scalar-tensor theories, specifically Horndeski theories and their generalizations. The review focuses on the topics related to linear stability at the perturbation level over the non-singular background solutions: 1) the no-go theorem, valid for non-singular cosmologies within Horndeski theory, 2) the updates on possible approaches to evade the no-go theorem, 3) the role of disformal transformations relating the Horndeski subclasses with the generalized theories like DHOST, 4) the effects on stability caused by additional matter coupling and potential emergence of superluminal perturbation modes in the multi-component setting.</description>

      <title>General Expressions for $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ for Several Minimally Coupled Single Scalar Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a generalized expressions for the scalar power spectrum and the observational parameters of inflation (the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$) for several single field scalar models minimally coupled with gravity. We work in the framework where the perturbed Einstein equations, at linear order, are of the same form to those obtained in the standard \textit{k}-inflation, with generalized form of the pump field $z$. By generalizing the expressions for $z$ and the speed of sound squared $c_{\rm s}^2$, using the slow-roll approximation, we calculate $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ up to the second order in the Hubble flow parameters.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic traversable wormholes: minimum requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While wormholes are just as good a prediction of Einstein's theory as black holes, they are subject to severe restrictions from quantum field theory. To allow for the possibility of interstellar travel, a macroscopic wormhole would need to maintain sufficiently low radial tidal forces. It is proposed in this paper that the assumption of zero tidal forces, i.e., the limiting case, is sufficient for overcoming the restrictions from quantum field theory. The feasibility of this approach is subsequently discussed by (a) introducing the additional conditions needed to ensure that the radial tidal forces can indeed be sufficiently low and (b) by viewing traversable wormholes as emergent phenomena, thereby increasing the likelihood of their existence.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational waves from unknown neutron stars in binary systems with long orbital periods in O3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by asymmetric rotating neutron stars are the primary targets of continuous gravitational-wave searches. Neutron stars in binary systems are particularly interesting due to the potential for non-axisymmetric deformations induced by a companion star. However, all-sky searches for unknown neutron stars in binary systems are very computationally expensive and this limits their sensitivity and/or breadth. In this paper we present results of a search for signals with gravitational-wave frequencies between $50$ and $150$~Hz, from systems with orbital periods between $100$ and $1\,000$ days and projected semi-major axes between $40$ and $200$~light-seconds. This parameter-space region has never been directly searched before. We do not detect any signal, and our results exclude gravitational-wave amplitudes above $1.25 \times 10^{-25}$ at $144.32$~Hz with $95\%$ confidence. Our improved search pipeline is more sensitive than any previous all-sky binary search by about $75\%$.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with the latent heat of neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Seidov limit is a bound on the maximum latent heat that a presumed first-order phase transition of neutron-star matter can have before its excess energy density, not compensated by additional pressure, results in gravitational collapse. Because latent heat forces an apparent nonanalytic behaviour in plots correlating physical quantities (kinks in two-dimensional, ridges in three-dimensional ones), it can be constrained by data. As the onset of collapse depends on the intensity of gravity, testing for sudden derivative changes and, if they are large, breaching the Seidov limit would reward with two successive discoveries: such a phase transition (which could stem from hadron matter but also from a gravitational phase transition), and a modification of General Relativity (thus breaking the matter/gravity degeneracy). We illustrate the point with $f(R)=R+\alpha R^2$ metric gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations and flavour mixing by incorporating the gravitational effects through the Dirac equation in curved spacetime inside a spherically symmetric star. We show that the flavour transition probabilities of the neutrinos depend on the interior spacetime metric as they propagate out of the star. As a consequence, we show that one could distinguish between different possible equation of states of nuclear matter even for an isolated neutron star if one could determine the flavour composition of emitted neutrinos near the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>Linear Perturbations and Stability Analysis in $f(T)$ Braneworld Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed analysis of the full linear perturbations in the braneworld scenario within $f(T)$ gravity. By decomposing the perturbations of the theory into the scalar, transverse vector, antisymmetric pseudotensor, and symmetric transverse-traceless tensor modes, we derive the quadratic action for each mode. The results indicate that there is a total of one scalar, one massless vector, and one tensor propagating degrees of freedom. Consequently, in comparison to general relativity, no additional degrees of freedom appear under the flat braneworld background in the linearized theory. For a thick brane model with $f(T)=T+ \alpha T^2$, we find that it exhibits stability against linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic modes remain unaffected by local field redefinition, the non-hydrodynamic modes are sensitive to it and can be eliminated through an appropriate all-order redefinition. This leads to a new hydro frame, where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We further show that the resulting stress tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode, illustrating its control over the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band, with their GW signals characterized by ``repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital inclination may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of ``bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>

      <title>Generalized conformal quantum mechanics as an ideal observer in two-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an action for a generalized conformal mechanics (GCM) coupled to Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity from a double scaling limit of the motion of a charged massive particle in the near-horizon geometry of a near-extremal spherical black hole. When JT gravity is treated in the classical approximation, the backreaction of the particle's wavefunction on the time-reparametrization mode (and therefore the bulk metric) vanishes while the conformal symmetry in GCM is reparametrized in a state-dependent way. We also construct the semi-classical Hilbert space of the full theory by explicitly solving the general time-dependent normalizable solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for GCM, and show that the time-reparametrization mode can be inferred from the measurement of suitable observables. Since the full theory of the GCM coupled to JT gravity is amenable to quantization, it can lead to a solvable model for a detector coupled to quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, CC, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Carroll Galileons in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first example of an interacting Carroll supersymmetric field theory with both temporal and spatial derivatives, belonging to the Galileon class, where the non-linear field equation remains second-order in derivative. To achieve this, we introduce two novel tools. First, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional Galilei/Carroll duality can be extended to higher dimensions, and includes the supersymmetry, by expressing the generators in a spinor basis. We then show that Carroll superalgebras are naturally connected to Euclidean, rather than Poincar\'e, superalgebras. Using the real multiplet of the three-dimensional N $=1$ Euclidean supersymmetry, we construct the scalar multiplet for N $=2$ Carroll supersymmetry and develop a tensor calculus to realize the aforementioned model. These results offer new insights into the structure of genuine higher-dimensional Carroll field theories and Carroll supersymmetry. While these tools are utilized to build a specific model, we anticipate that they possess broader applications in Carrollian physics.</description>

      <title>Minimum gas mass accreted by spinning intermediate-mass black holes in stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) growing through repeated black hole mergers in stellar clusters statistically asymptotes to zero. Putative observations of IMBHs with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$ would require a phase of coherent gas accretion to spin up the black hole. We estimate the amount of gas necessary to produce a given IMBH spin. If the observed IMBH mass and spin are $M\gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$ and $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$, respectively, the IMBH must have coherently accreted at least $\sim 100~M_\odot$ of gas. In this scenario, as long as the spin is not maximal, the IMBH can only accrete at most half of its mass. Our estimates can constrain the relative contribution of accretion and mergers to the growth of IMBHs in dense stellar environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the reported lensing anomaly of the CMB by considering several phenomenological modifications of the lensing consistency parameter, $A_{\rm L}$. Considering Planck spectra alone, we find statisically significant evidence for scale dependence (`running') of $A_{\rm L}$. We then demonstrate that the anomaly is entirely driven by Planck's low multipoles, $\ell \leq 30$. When these data points are excluded a joint analysis with several other datasets clearly favors $\Lambda$CDM over the extended $\Lambda \rm CDM+A_L$ model.
  Not only that the lensing anomaly and low $\ell$ anomaly of the CMB go away in this case, but also the $S_8$ tension is ameliorated, and only the Hubble tension persists.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Tension: Relativistic Dark Matter Production from Long-lived Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tension between direct measurements of the Hubble constant and those stemming from Cosmic Microwave Background probes has triggered a multitude of studies. The connection between cosmology and particle physics has shown to be a valuable approach to addressing the Hubble tension. In particular, increasing the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe helps alleviate the problem. In this work, we write down effective field theory describing relativistic dark matter production in association with neutrinos leading to a larger $H_0$. We derive limits on the effective energy scale that governs this relativistic production of dark matter as a function of the dark matter mass for fermion, vector, and scalar dark matter fields. In particular, scalar dark matter particles are more effective in increasing the effective number of relativistic species. Also, if they have weak scale masses, then the relativistic production of dark matter should be governed by Planck scale effective operators in order to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with the full-shape galaxy power spectrum: first constraints on scale-dependent modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe in 1998, modified gravity (MG) theories have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to dark energy (DE). While distinguishing the effects of MG from those of DE using cosmic background expansion alone is difficult, the large-scale structure is expected to differ significantly. Among the plethora of MG models, we are particularly interested in those that introduce a scale dependence in the growth of perturbations; specifically, theories that introduce fifth forces mediated by scalar fields with a finite range accessible to cosmological probes. This is the case with $f(R)$ gravity, which is widely regarded as the most studied model in cosmology. In this work, we utilize, for the first time, the full-shape power spectrum of galaxies to constrain scale-dependent modified gravity theories. By using BOSS DR12 dataset, along with a BBN prior on $ \omega_b $ and a Planck 2018 prior on $ n_s $, we obtain an upper bound of $ |f_{R0}| &lt; 5.89 \times 10^{-6} $ at 68% confidence level (c.l.) and $ &lt; 1.53 \times 10^{-5} $ at 95% c.l. for the Hu-Sawicki ($ n=1 $) model. We discuss that it is highly unlikely these constraints will be significantly improved by future galaxy spectroscopic catalogs, such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Condensate decay in a radiation dominated cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\,\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\gamma(t)$ is always \emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization of free bosonic closed string theory and observe that the physicality of states requires vanishing of the worldsheet Virasoro algebra generators sandwiched between any two physical states. This requirement yields four classes of physical states, depending on discrete worldsheet symmetries: parity and time reversal. The usual string states which are highest weight states of the Virasoro algebra, preserve both, while the other new three classes break one or both. We apply our formulation to an accelerated worldsheet with horizons, initiating the worldsheet formulation of a thermal string theory and strings probing horizon of black holes.</description>

      <title>Looking at extremal black holes from very far away</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes are subject to large quantum effects, which modify their low-temperature thermodynamic behavior. Hitherto, these quantum effects were analyzed by separating the geometry into the near-horizon region and its exterior. It is desirable to understand and reproduce such corrections from the full higher-dimensional asymptotically flat or AdS geometry's perspective. We address this question in this article and fill this gap. Specifically, we find off-shell eigenmodes of the quadratic fluctuation operator of the Euclidean gravitational dynamics, with eigenvalues that vanish linearly with temperature. We illustrate this for BTZ and neutral black holes with hyperbolic horizons in AdS in Einstein-Hilbert theory, and for the charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory. The linear scaling with Matsubara frequency, which is a distinctive feature of the modes, together with the fact that their wavefunctions localize close to the horizon as we approach extremality, identifies them as responsible for the aforementioned quantum effects. We provide a contour prescription to deal with the sign indefiniteness of the Euclidean Einstein-Maxwell action, which we derive to aid our analysis. We also resolve a technical puzzle regarding modes associated with rotational isometries in stationary black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic formalism of inflation allows us to describe the scalar-field dynamics in a non-perturbative way. The correspondence between the diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations makes it possible to exhaustively construct analytical solutions in stochastic inflation. Those exact statistical quantities such as distribution and correlation functions have one-to-one correspondence to the exactly solvable solutions in non-relativistic quantum mechanics in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials. A class of such solutions is presented by means of isospectral Hamiltonians with an underlying symmetry called shape invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scalar field equation in a (2+1)-dimensional charged BTZ black hole. The quasinormal spectra of the solution are obtained applying two different methods and good convergence between both is achieved. Using the characteristic integration technique we tested the geometry evidencing its stability against linear scalar perturbations. As a consequence a two pattern set of frequencies (families) emerges, one oscillatory and another purely imaginary. In that spectra, the fundamental modes without angular momentum are hugely affected by the presence of the black hole charge surprisedly even for small values of this. Their evolution are controlled by purely imaginary frequencies as in the non-rotating chargeless BTZ case. Similar to others AdS black holes, the fundamental oscillations scale the black hole event horizon and the temperature of the hole (far from maximal charges).</description>

      <title>The Quantum Spectral Method: From Atomic Orbitals to Classical Self-Force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the Quantum Spectral Method to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

Abstract: In the era of gravitational waves physics, when detections of wave fronts are increasing in number, sensibility, frequencies and distances, gravitational physics has entered a period of maximum activity and brilliance. This has open a new window where General Relativity can be challenged in both weak as strong-field regimes. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of gravitational waves propagation and emission in the weak-field regime for gravitational theories within the Palatini formalism. Our results show that gravitational waves propagation in vacuum matches General Relativity predictions as well as the multipolar expansion when considering weak sources, independently of the form of the gravitational action.</description>

      <title>Lunar Time in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the general-relativistic definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) based on the IAU 2000 resolutions that provide a framework for relativistic reference systems. From this foundation, we derive a transformation equation that describes the relative rate of TCL with respect to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) for various locations of the clock on lunar surface. This equation serves as the cornerstone for constructing a relativistic TCL--TCG time conversion algorithm. Using this algorithm, we can compute both secular and periodic variations in the rate of an atomic clock placed on the Moon, relative to an identical clock on Earth. The algorithm accounts for various effects, including time dilation caused by the Moon's orbital motion around Earth, gravitational potentials of both Earth and Moon, and direct and indirect time dilation effects due to tidal perturbations caused by the Sun and other major planets of the solar system. Our approach provides exquisite details of the TCL--TCG transformation, achieving a precision of several nanoseconds within the spatial volume dominated by the Earth's gravitational field known as the Hill sphere. This sphere extends from the Earth to a distance of approximately 1.5 million km, substantially encompassing the Moon's orbit. To validate our methodology for lunar coordinate time, we compare it with the mathematical formalism of local inertial frames applied to the Earth-Moon system and confirm their equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new simple approximations for quintessence solutions to Einsteins's field equations in spatially homogeneous, isotropic and flat spacetimes. The approximations are typically an order of magnitude more accurate than anything available in the literature, which from an observational perspective makes numerical calculations superfluous. For example, our tracking quintessence approximation yields a $\sim 0.1\%$ maximum relative error of $H(z)/H_0$ for the observationally viable inverse power law scalar field potentials, and similarly for viable thawing quintessence models using two slow-roll parameters. We situate the new results in a broader dark energy context, where the present parametrized deviations from $\Lambda$CDM offer simple alternatives to the CPL parametrization, useful for observations at increasingly large redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of fermions in the vicinity of Sung-Won-Kim wormholes \cite{SW Kim PRD 1996} within the framework of a generalized Kaluza-Klein gravity. The study explores the geometric and quantum implications of introducing an extra dimension into the Sung-Won-Kim wormhole model. The impact of this additional dimension on the stability and traversability of the wormholes, as well as on the fermionic equations of motion, is analyzed. By examining the modified Dirac equation in this extended framework, the emergence of geometric phases and quantum holonomies is discussed, providing insights into the topological aspects of fermion dynamics in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The canonical analysis of the $\lambda R$ model extended with the term due to Blas, Pujolas, and Sibiryakov $[BPS]$ is performed. The analysis is developed for any value of $\lambda$, but particular attention is paid to the point $\lambda=\frac{1}{3}$ because of the closeness with linearized General Relativity [GR]. Then, we add the higher-order conformal term, the so-called Cotton-square term, to study the constraint structure of what constitutes an example of kinetic-conformal Horava's gravity. At the conformal point, an extra second-class constraint appears; this does not arise at other values of $\lambda$. Then, the Dirac brackets are constructed, and we will observe that the $\lambda R$-Cotton-square model shares the same number of degrees of freedom with linearized $GR$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the weak lensing corrections to the CMB polarization anisotropies. We concentrate on the effect of rotation and show that the rotation of polarisation is a true physical effect which has to be taken into account at second order in perturbation theory. We clarify inconsistencies on the treatment of this rotation in the recent literature. We also show that at first order in perturbation theory there is no rotation of polarisation also for vector and tensor modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show generically that the dynamics of a probe particle near the event horizon of a non-extreme black hole is described by the tachyon effective action. The Hagedorn temperature in the action is always equal to the Hawking temperature of the background black hole. The fact suggests that the infalling particle should decay completely into gravitons or closed strings approaching the event horizon. The increased area in the black hole due to absorption of a particle should be interpreted as the entropy of degenerate states of the closed strings that the particle decays into. With the energy match condition between the infalling particle and the emitted closed strings on the event horizon, we examine this variational area-entropy relation and find that it matches in all cases if the closed string emission process from an unstable D0-brane obeys the first law.</description>

Abstract: We present a new, simulation-based inference method to compute the angular power spectrum of the distribution of foreground gravitational-wave transient events. As a first application of this method, we use the binary black hole mergers observed during the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA third observation run to test the spatial distribution of these sources. We find no evidence for anisotropy in their angular distribution. We discuss further applications of this method to investigate other gravitational-wave source populations and their correlations to the cosmological large-scale structure.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the one-loop quantum entanglement entropy in ten-dimensional Type-II string theory using the orbifold method by analytically continuing in $N$ the genus-one partition function for string orbifolds on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$ conical spaces known for all odd integers $N &gt; 1$. We show that the tachyonic contributions to the orbifold partition function can be appropriately summed and analytically continued to an expression that is finite in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ resulting in a finite and calculable answer for the entanglement entropy. We discuss the implications of the finiteness of the entanglement entropy for the information paradox, quantum gravity, and holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological polytope and bootstrap programs have revealed interesting connections between positive geometries, modern on-shell methods and bootstrap principles studied in the amplitudes community with the wavefunction of the Universe in toy models of FRW cosmologies. To compute these FRW correlators, one often faces integrals that are too difficult to evaluate by direct integration. Borrowing from the Feynman integral community, the method of (canonical) differential equations provides an efficient alternative for evaluating these integrals. Moreover, we further develop our geometric understanding of these integrals by describing the associated \emph{relative} twisted cohomology. Leveraging recent progress in our understanding of relative twisted cohomology in the Feynman integral community, we give an algorithm to predict the basis size and simplify the computation of the differential equations satisfied by FRW correlators.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in String Compactifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of Type-II compactifications to four and six dimensions on several Calabi-Yau manifolds in the orbifold limit with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy. The spectrum can contain tachyons in the doubly-twisted sectors which can lead to new infrared divergences for the partition function that are not present in the orbifolds of the uncompactified ten-dimensional theory. We show that all tachyonic contributions in these models admit a resummation and analytic continuation that yields finite entropy in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ just as in ten dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unbiased estimation of gravitational-wave anisotropies from noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most exciting targets of current and future gravitational-wave observations is the angular power spectrum of the astrophysical GW background. This cumulative signal encodes information about the large-scale structure of the Universe, as well as the formation and evolution of compact binaries throughout cosmic time. However, the finite rate of compact binary mergers gives rise to temporal shot noise, which introduces a significant bias in measurements of the angular power spectrum if not explicitly accounted for. Previous work showed that this bias can be removed by cross-correlating GW sky maps constructed from different observing times. However, this work considered an idealised measurement scenario, ignoring detector specifics and in particular noise contributions. Here we extend this temporal cross-correlation method to account for these difficulties, allowing us to implement the first unbiased anisotropic search pipeline for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data. In doing so, we show that the existing pipeline is biased even in the absence of shot noise, due to previously neglected sub-leading contributions to the noise covariance. We apply our pipeline to mock LIGO data, and find that our improved analysis will be crucial for stochastic searches from the current observing run (O4) onwards.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement on Black Hole Horizons in String Theory and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the exact one-loop partition function of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of Euclidean BTZ black hole with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy of the black hole horizon in string theory as a function of the mass and spin of the black hole and the $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ radius. We analyze the tachyonic contribution to the modular integrand for the partition function known for odd integers $N&gt;1$ and show that it admits an analytic continuation resulting in a finite answer for the modular integral in the physical region $0&lt; N \leq 1$. We discuss the flat space limit and the relevance of this computation for quantum gravity near black hole horizons and holography in relation to the thermal entropy.</description>

      <title>Single and entangled atomic systems in thermal bath and the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect in the context of two-level single and entangled atomic systems that are static in a thermal bath. We consider the interaction between the systems and a massless scalar field, covering the scenarios of free space as well as within a cavity. Through the calculation of atomic transition rates and comparing with the results of [\textcolor{blue}{\textit{Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 085018}}], it is found that in free space there is an equivalence between the upward and downward transition rates of a uniformly accelerated atom with respect to an observer with that of a single atom which is static with respect to the observer and immersed in a thermal bath, as long as the temperature of the thermal bath matches the Unruh temperature. This equivalence between the upward and downward transition rates breaks down in the presence of a cavity. For two-atom systems, considering the initial state to be in a general pure entangled form, we find that in this case the equivalence between the upward and downward transition rates of the accelerated and static thermal bath scenarios holds only under specific limiting conditions in free space, but breaks down completely in a cavity setup. Though the ratio of the upward and downward transition rates in the thermal bath matches exactly with those of the accelerated systems in free space as well as inside the cavity.</description>

      <title>Dual AGNs: Precursors of Binary Supermassive Black Hole Formation and Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) on scales of a few tens of kpc can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger precursors. This study uses the {\sc Romulus25} cosmological simulation to investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the properties of AGNs ($L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} \rm $ erg s$^{-1}$) and their neighboring SMBHs (any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at $z \leq 2$. This is our underlying population. We then applied the luminosity threshold of $L_{bol} &gt; 10^{43} $ erg s$^{-1}$ to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. We also find that the number of dual AGNs with separations of 0.5-4 kpc is twice the number of duals with separations of 4-30 kpc. All dual AGNs in our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared to single AGNs, duals have a lower black hole-to-halo mass ratio. We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas mass, are generally consistent with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending towards the higher end of their respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems, slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction from self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow one to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiralling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealised N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiralling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in the light of DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest findings from the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) data release 1 (DR1) [3], combined with data from the cosmic microwave background and supernovae, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant. This study has considered the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization for the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and has indicated a possible phantom barrier crossing in the recent past. Despite CPL being the most commonly used parameterization, recent research has pointed out issues with its prior selection and parameter degeneracies. In this paper, we introduce an alternative two-parameter parameterization of the dark-energy EoS, at high redshifts, this new parameterization can be approximated to the CPL form. Our findings also indicate that the current value of the EoS of dark energy resembles quintessence, with evidence of a recent crossing of the phantom barrier, supporting the conclusions in [3]. Furthermore, our model significantly reduces the Hubble tension to about 2.8{\sigma} when compared to Hubble Space Telescope and SH0ES data [51], and to 1.6{\sigma} with standardized TRGB and Type Ia supernova data [56]. Bayesian model selection using Bayes factors shows a moderate preference for our parameterization over the {\Lambda} CDM model, aligned with the DESI2024 results and favoring dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>A holographic model of magnetohydrodynamics with fortuitous SO(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study magnetohydrodynamics using holography. The gravity model is closely related to the STU supergravity in five dimensions and admits an analytical black brane solution carrying the conserved charge dual to the magnetic 1-form symmetry of the magnetohydrodynamic system. The black brane solution features a fortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing the magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge fields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric part of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV cut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the proportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite the zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.</description>

      <title>Cocoon shock breakout emission from binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shock breakout emission is among the first observable signals in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including neutron star (NS) mergers, and it can be the dominant component in low-luminosity short gamma-ray bursts (llsGRBs), as exemplified by GRB 170817A. In this work, we investigate the cocoon shock breakout emission in NS mergers and how its signal depends on the outermost layers of the ejecta profile, which we derive from general relativistic radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We study the formation of the cocoon as a consequence of a relativistic jet propagating through the ejecta. To explore the influence of the outermost layers of the ejecta on the breakout emission, we explore cases where the ejecta has a sharp cutoff or an extended smooth tail. We find that the shock breakout emission is strongly influenced by the shape of the ejecta outer layers, with extended tails yielding results consistent with the observed properties of GRB 170817A, whereas sharp cutoffs overestimate the radiated energy. Using a Bayesian analysis, we estimate the best fit parameters of the central engine, considering both accreting black hole and magnetized neutron star scenarios. Our findings indicate a slight preference for the scenarios where the engine is a black hole. Our work probes the nature of neutron star mergers and highlights the importance of the shape of the ejecta profile in modeling early electromagnetic counterparts to these mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass make up the entire dark matter they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work, we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of PBHs, are performed. Using the Earth-Mars distance as an observational probe, we show that the perturbations are below the current detection limits and thus PBHs are not directly constrained by solar system ephemerides. We estimate that an improvement in the measurement accuracy by more than an order of magnitude or the extraction of signals well below the noise level are required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled system consisting of a complex scalar field, a U(1) gauge field, a complex Higgs scalar field, and Einstein gravity. We present nontopological soliton star solutions in which the interior geometry is described by the de Sitter metric, the exterior by the Schwarzschild metric, and these two regions are attached by a spherical surface layer with a finite thickness. This structure is the same as the so-called gravastars, so we refer to these solutions as \lq solitonic gravastars\rq . We demonstrate that compact solitonic gravastars that possessing photon spheres can appear. Additionally, we study the mass and compactness of solitonic gravastars for various sets of parameters that characterize the system.</description>
