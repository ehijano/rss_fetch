      <title>Neural networks for bifurcation and linear stability analysis of steady states in partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19707v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Synchronization transitions in spiking networks with adaptive coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive link sizes is a major breakthrough step in evolving networks and is now considered as an essential process both in biological and artificial neural networks. In adaptive networks the link weights change in time and, in brain dynamics, these changes are controlled by the potential variations of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. In particular, in biological neural networks the adaptivity of the links (synapses) was first addressed by D. Hebb who proposed the rule that neurons which fire together wire together. In the present study, we explore the effects of adaptive linking in networks where hybrid synchronization patterns (solitaries, chimeras and bump states) are observed in the absence of adaptivity (i.e., for constant coupling strengths). The network consists of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons coupled nonlocally in a 1D ring geometry. The adaptivity follows the Hebbian principle adjusted by the Oja rule to avoid unbounded increase of the coupling strengths. Our results indicate that, for negative coupling strengths, the adaptive LIF network may transit through chimera state regimes with different multiplicity, provided that the time scales governing the link dynamics are relatively small compared to the time scales of the potential evolution. Moreover, the size of the coherent and incoherent domains of the chimera and their multiplicity change following the average coupling strength in the network. Similar results are shown for the case of bump states: for positive coupling strengths, the adaptive LIF network transits through states of different number of active and subthreshold domains. The size and number of these domains also follow the evolution of the average coupling strength. Such transient effects are suppressed when the time scales governing the link adaptive dynamics become of the same order as the time scales governing the potential dynamics.</description>

      <title>Variational Principle for Optical Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {The problem of laser beam concentration in a focal spot via wavefront variations is formulated as a maximization of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$ defined as the light power passing through aperture of an arbitrary shape located in the far field. Variational principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for at least the $local$ $maximum$ of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$. The wavefront shape is obtained as exact solution of nonlinear integral equation.}</description>

      <title>Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12130v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit aspects of dynamics and stability of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. By a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, we show that localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold and that localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, the constants of motion in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation play a crucial role. An infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.</description>
