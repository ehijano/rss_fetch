      <title>The Largest Circle Enclosing $n$ Lattice Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of elementary plane geometry problems closely related to the title of this paper. Here, a circle is the 1-dimensional curve bounding a disk. For any nonnegative integer, a circle is called $n$-enclosing if it contains exactly $n$ lattice points on the $xy$-plane in its interior. The main questions are when the largest $n$-enclosing circle exists and what the largest radius is. We study the small integer cases by hand and extend to all $n&lt;1100$ with the aid of a computer. We find that frequently such a circle does not exist, e.g., when $n=5,6$. We then show a few general results on these circles including some regularities among their radii and an easy criterion to determine exactly when largest $n$-enclosing circles exist. Further, from numerical evidence, we conjecture that the set of integers whose largest enclosing circles exist is infinite, and so is its complementary in the set of nonnegative integers. Throughout this paper we present more mysteries/problems/conjectures than answers/solutions/theorems. In particular, we list many conjectures and some unsolved problems including possible higher dimensional generalizations at the end of the last two sections.</description>

      <title>Metric Matrix in Barycentric Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the concept of the metric matrix is introduced to establish a concise and unified formulation for the inner product in barycentric coordinates. Building on this framework, we explore the intrinsic algebraic identities of barycentric coordinates and their direct correspondence with geometric theorems. Through this approach, we derive a series of novel results and provide new proofs for several classical theorems in triangle geometry.</description>

      <title>Holder continuity of an alternating Erdos series on prime K-tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This open problem, first posed by Erd{\omicron}s, was further explored by Terence Tao. Tao work shows that the series can converge conditionally, but only under a sufficiently strong form of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for k-primary pairs. Based on this, we offer a new method leading to a representation of the series as a Riemann-Stieltjes integral or a tightly coupled prime counting function. We rigorously analyze this integral by decomposing it into principal and error terms, applying integration by parts in the Stieltjes sense, and defining the error terms. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we investigate the H{\omicron}lder continuation of {\psi}(x) in the asymptotic form {\psi}(x) = x+O(x 1/2), and introduce a test function g(x) = e^( i{\pi}x) e^( -{\lambda}x) , which is smooth and Lipschitz. Applying Young's criterion, we show that the integral converges. Moreover , we prove that the integral converges perfectly for {\lambda} &gt; 3 2 , based on sharp bounds on the error terms. Our results are supported by fractional Sobolev integrations and justify the use of Young's inequality under generalized Holder conditions.</description>
