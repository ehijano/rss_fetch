      <title>Confinement controls bacterial spreading at all scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many natural environments such as in soils or in physiological ducts bacterial motion often alternates between three-dimensional (3D) swimming in the bulk and a quite distinct two-dimensional (2D) kinematics at surfaces. This interplay is crucial to assess large-scale transport and contamination properties but still remains poorly understood. Here, using a prototypical setup, we address this fundamental question for motile E. coli bacteria undergoing run-and-tumble (R&amp;T) exploration under confinement. We report the first experimental measurements of the emergent large-scale diffusivity revealing its explicit dependence on the confinement height. In addition, we provide a theoretical framework showing how the diffusion coefficient is governed by the interplay between 2D and 3D motion coupled to an internal biochemical process that induces large scale memory in the exploration dynamics. These findings offer general and critical insights into how microswimmers explore complex environments where their motion is bound to alternate between bulk and surfaces.</description>

      <title>Formation of a Single Bioconvection Spot in Euglena Suspension Induced by Negative Phototaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms are known to alter their motility in response to external stimuli. A typical example is the responseknown as taxis, which includes behaviors such as moving toward a light source (positive phototaxis) or away from it(negative phototaxis). In this study, we focused on bioconvection induced by the negative phototaxis of a Euglenasuspension exposed to strong light from the bottom. Recent studies have revealed that Euglena bioconvectioninduced by negative phototaxis exhibits localized structure. In a previous study, we found that a single Euglenabioconvection spot (EBC spot) maintains its structure in a cylindrical container. Such a localized structure is notexclusive to Euglena, but has also reported in red tide algae, suggesting that this is a universal feature ofbioconvection phenomena. In this paper, we investigated the formation conditions of EBC spot phenomena throughexperiments and numerical simulations. In the experiments, we examined the variation in EBC spot formation as afunction of suspension height and average cell density, revealing that the critical average cell density increases withsuspension height. In the numerical simulations, we conducted bioconvection simulations based on a model ofEuglena motility that incorporated three types of behavior: the negative gravitaxis, negative phototaxis, andbehavior of moving toward darker areas. Our model successfully reproduced the localized state of a two-dimensional EBC spot. Furthermore, calculations corresponding to the experimental conditions of suspension heightand average cell density revealed that the critical average cell density for bioconvection decreases as thesuspension height increases.</description>

      <title>Learning to reset in target search problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target search problems are central to a wide range of fields, from biological foraging to the optimization algorithms. Recently, the ability to reset the search has been shown to significantly improve the searcher's efficiency. However, the optimal resetting strategy depends on the specific properties of the search problem and can often be challenging to determine. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to train agents capable of optimizing their search efficiency in environments by learning how to reset. First, we validate the approach in a well-established benchmark: the Brownian search with resetting. There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely resembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this scenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only when to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this more complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting and turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed benchmarks. These results demonstrate how reinforcement learning can serve both as an optimization tool and a mechanism for uncovering new, interpretable strategies in stochastic search processes with resetting.</description>

      <title>Integrating Dynamical Systems Modeling with Spatiotemporal scRNA-seq Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of biological systems is fundamental to deciphering cellular behavior, developmental processes, and disease progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided static snapshots of gene expression, offering valuable insights into cellular states at a single time point. Recent advancements in temporally resolved scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and time-series spatial transcriptomics (temporal-ST) have further revolutionized our ability to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual cells. These technologies, when combined with computational frameworks such as Markov chains, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and generative models like optimal transport and Schr\"odinger bridges, enable the reconstruction of dynamic cellular trajectories and cell fate decisions. This review discusses how these dynamical system approaches offer new opportunities to model and infer cellular dynamics from a systematic perspective.</description>

      <title>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.</description>

      <title>Perfect Stabilization of Biomolecular Adhesions under Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells attach to their environment by means of focal adhesions, which are molecular complexes that exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt to mechanical load by changing their size. Drawing from the biomolecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, we present a generic model for mechanically induced adhesion growth where conformational states of molecules already in the adhesion cluster are coupled to the adsorption of further molecules. For sufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth ensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of instability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby adhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces without breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state diagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show that perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically relevant timescales. Finally, we show that perfect stabilization and related instabilities are generic phenomenona that can be realized in many different ways if internal molecule states are coupled to adsorption in nonequilibrium.</description>

      <title>Excitability and oscillations of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In living cells, cycles of formation and dissolution of liquid droplets can mediate biological functions such as DNA repair. However, the minimal physicochemical prerequisite for such droplet oscillations remains elusive. Here, we present a simple model composed of only two independent chemical components with their diffusive and chemical fluxes governed by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. There is turnover of fuel that maintains a chemical reaction away from equilibrium, leading to active droplets. We find that a single active droplet undergoes a pitchfork-bifurcation in the droplet volume upon increasing the fueling strength. Strikingly, the active droplet becomes excitable upon adding a further chemical reaction. For sufficient fueling, the system undergoes self-sustained oscillations cycling between droplet formation and dissolution. The minimal nature of our model suggests self-sustained active droplets as functional modules for de novo life.</description>

      <title>Alpha helices are more evolutionarily robust to environmental perturbations than beta sheets: Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics for protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How typical elements that shape organisms, such as protein secondary structures, have evolved, or how evolutionarily susceptible/resistant they are to environmental changes, are significant issues in evolutionary biology, structural biology, and biophysics. According to Darwinian evolution, natural selection and genetic mutations are the primary drivers of biological evolution. However, the concept of ``robustness of the phenotype to environmental perturbations across successive generations," which seems crucial from the perspective of natural selection, has not been formalized or analyzed. In this study, through Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics we formalize the stability of the free energy in the space of amino acid sequences that can design particular protein structure against perturbations of the chemical potential of water surrounding a protein as such robustness. This evolutionary stability is defined as a decreasing function of a quantity analogous to the susceptibility in the statistical mechanics of magnetic bodies specific to the amino acid sequence of a protein. Consequently, in a two-dimensional square lattice protein model composed of 36 residues, we found that as we increase the stability of the free energy against perturbations in environmental conditions, the structural space shows a steep step-like reduction. Furthermore, lattice protein structures with higher stability against perturbations in environmental conditions tend to have a higher proportion of $\alpha$-helices and a lower proportion of $\beta$-sheets. This result is qualitatively confirmed by comparing the histograms of the percentage of secondary structures of evolutionarily robust proteins and randomly selected proteins through an empirical validation using a protein database.</description>
