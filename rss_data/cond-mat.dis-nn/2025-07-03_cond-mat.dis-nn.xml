      <title>Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of vector Hopfield network near and above saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically a Hopfield fully-connected network with $d$-vector spins. These networks are models of associative memory that generalize the standard Hopfield with Ising spins. We study the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of the system, considering the system in its retrieval phase $\alpha&lt;\alpha_c$ and beyond. We derive the Replica Symmetric solution for the equilibrium thermodynamics of the system, together with its phase diagram: we find that the retrieval phase of the network shrinks with growing spin dimension, having ultimately a vanishing critical capacity $\alpha_c\propto 1/d$ in the large $d$ limit. As a trade-off, we observe that in the same limit vector Hopfield networks are able to denoise corrupted input patterns in the first step of retrieval dynamics, up to very large capacities $\widetilde{\alpha}\propto d$. We also study the static properties of the system at zero temperature, considering the statistical properties of soft modes of the energy Hessian spectrum. We find that local minima of the energy landscape related to memory states have ungapped spectra with rare soft eigenmodes: these excitations are localized, their measure condensating on the noisiest neurons of the memory state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic potentials of metallic alloys in the undercooled liquid and solid glassy states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first present a comparative analysis of temperature evolution of the excess thermodynamic potentials (state functions), the enthalpy $\Delta H$, entropy $\Delta S$ and Gibbs free energy $\Delta \Phi$, determined for \textit{i}) undercooled melts using literature data and \textit{ii}) solid glassy state calculated on the basis of calorimetry measurements using an approach proposed recently. Three metallic alloys were taken as an example for data analysis. It is found that temperature dependences $\Delta H(T)$, $\Delta S(T)$ and $\Delta G(T)$ calculated with both approaches coincide in the supercooled liquid range (i.e. at temperatures $T_g&lt;T&lt;T_x$, where $T_g$ and $T_x$ are the glass transition and crystallization onset temperatures, respectively). However, the necessary conditions for this coincidence is the introduction of important changes to the above approach \textit{i}), which are related to the calculation of the melting entropy. We also introduce and calculate a dimensionless order parameter $\xi$, which changes in the range $0&lt;\xi&lt;1$ and characterizes the evolution of the structural order from liquid-like to crystal-like one. It is shown that the order parameter $\xi_{scl}$ calculated for the end of the supercooled liquid range (i.e. for a temperature just below $T_x$) correlates with the melt critical cooling rate $R_c$: the smaller the order parameter $\xi_{scl}$ (i.e. the closer the structure to that of the equilibrium liquid), the smaller $R_c$ is.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Nonreciprocal Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional disordered block subwavelength resonator systems subject to nonreciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effects from Symmetry Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics have become a central research focus, exemplified by the counterintuitive Mpemba effect where initially hotter systems can cool faster than colder ones. Studied extensively in both classical and quantum regimes, this phenomenon reveals diverse and complex behaviors across different systems. This review provides a concise overview of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), specifically emphasizing its connection to symmetry breaking and restoration in closed quantum many-body systems. We begin by outlining the classical Mpemba effect and its quantum counterparts, summarizing key findings. Subsequently, we introduce entanglement asymmetry and charge variance as key metrics for probing the QME from symmetry perspectives. Leveraging these tools, we analyze the early- and late-time dynamics of these quantities under Hamiltonian evolution and random unitary circuits. We conclude by discussing significant challenges and promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal hierarchy of thermal avalanches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In amorphous solids, frustrated elastic interactions conspire with thermal noise to trigger anomalously slow sequences of plastic rearrangements, termed "thermal avalanches", which play an important role during creep and glassy relaxations. Here we uncover the complex spatiotemporal structure of thermal avalanches in simulations of a model amorphous solid. We systematically disentangle mechanical and thermal triggering during logarithmic creep, revealing a hierarchy of fast localized cascades linked by slow, long-range, noise-mediated facilitation. These thermal avalanches exhibit heavy-tailed temporal correlations, reminiscent of seismic activity. Our work sheds light on the rich relaxation dynamics of amorphous solids, while providing a framework for identifying noise-mediated correlations. We validate this approach by revealing a similar hierarchy in experiments with crumpled thin sheets.</description>

      <title>Learning and Testing Inverse Statistical Problems For Interacting Systems Undergoing Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in situations where data is available, but the underlying model is not. It can therefore be necessary to infer the parameters of the latter starting from the former. Statistical mechanics offers a toolbox of techniques to address this challenge. In this work, we illustrate three of the main methods: the Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood, and Mean-Field approaches. We begin with a thorough theoretical introduction to these methods, followed by their application to inference in several well-known statistical physics systems undergoing phase transitions. Namely, we consider the ordered and disordered Ising models, the vector Potts model, and the Blume-Capel model on both regular lattices and random graphs. This discussion is accompanied by a GitHub repository that allows users to both reproduce the results and experiment with new systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Caloritronics in irradiated chiral ferromagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Imprints of information scrambling on eigenstates of a quantum chaotic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How are the spatial and temporal patterns of information scrambling in locally interacting quantum many-body systems imprinted on the eigenstates of the system's time-evolution operator? We address this question by identifying statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Delocalization Induced by Residue Imaginary Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</description>
