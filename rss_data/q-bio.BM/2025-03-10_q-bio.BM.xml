      <title>Learning conformational ensembles of proteins based on backbone geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Electricacupuncture Treating Detrusor Bladder Neck Dyscoordination After Suprasacral Spinal Cord Injury by Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives This study aimed to elucidate the potential mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) in restoring detrusor-bladder neck dyssynergesia (DBND) following suprasacral spinal cord injury.
  Methods A total of 52 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either a sham group (n=12) or a spinal cord injury model group (n=40). In the model group, DBND was induced in 40 rats through Hassan Shaker spinal cord transection, with 24 rats surviving spinal shock and subsequently randomized into two groups: a model-only group (DBND, n=12) and an EA intervention group (DBND+EA, n=12). DBND+EA was administered at Ciliao (BL32), Zhongji (RN3), and Sanyinjiao (SP6) acupoints, for 20 minutes per session, once daily for 10 consecutive days. On day 29 post-injury, all rats underwent urodynamic assessments, followed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics, and Western blot (WB) analysis of the detrusor and bladder neck tissues.
  Results Urodynamic evaluation demonstrated that EA intervention enhanced bladder function in DBND rats. HE staining indicated reduced fibroplasia in the detrusor muscle and alleviated inflammation in the bladder neck following EA. TMT proteomic analysis revealed 30 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the detrusor and 59 DEPs in the bladder neck post-EA treatment. WB results corroborated these TMT findings.
  Conclusion EA effectively promotes synergy between the detrusor muscle and bladder neck in DBND, likely by enhancing detrusor contractility and facilitating bladder neck relaxation during urination. This study provides mechanistic insights into the therapeutic role of EA in managing DBND.</description>

      <title>Interactive visualization of large molecular systems with VTX: example with a minimal whole-cell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VTX is an open-source molecular visualization software designed to overcome the scaling limitations of existing real-time molecular visualization software when handling massive molecular datasets. VTX employs a meshless molecular graphics engine utilizing impostor-based techniques and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and enables real-time visualization and manipulation of large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks against VMD, PyMOL, and ChimeraX using a 114-million-bead Martini minimal whole-cell model demonstrate VTX's efficiency, maintaining consistent frame rates even under interactive manipulation on standard computer hardware. VTX incorporates features such as screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for enhanced depth perception and free-fly navigation for intuitive exploration of large molecular systems. VTX is open-source and free for non commercial use. Binaries for Windows and Ubuntu Linux are available at \href{http://vtx.drugdesign.fr}{http://vtx.drugdesign.fr}. VTX source code is available at \href{https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization}{https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization}.</description>

      <title>RNACG: A Universal RNA Sequence Conditional Generation model based on Flow-Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RNA plays a pivotal role in diverse biological processes, ranging from gene regulation to catalysis. Recent advances in RNA design, such as RfamGen, Ribodiffusion and RDesign, have demonstrated promising results, with successful designs of functional sequences. However, RNA design remains challenging due to the inherent flexibility of RNA molecules and the scarcity of experimental data on tertiary and secondary structures compared to proteins. These limitations highlight the need for a more universal and comprehensive approach to RNA design that integrates diverse annotation information at the sequence level. To address these challenges, we propose RNACG (RNA Conditional Generator), a universal framework for RNA sequence design based on flow matching. RNACG supports diverse conditional inputs, including structural, functional, and family-specific annotations, and offers a modular design that allows users to customize the encoding network for specific tasks. By unifying sequence generation under a single framework, RNACG enables the integration of multiple RNA design paradigms, from family-specific generation to tertiary structure inverse folding.</description>

      <title>log-RRIM: Yield Prediction via Local-to-global Reaction Representation Learning and Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. A key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM effectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and influence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations. log-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. The framework's sophisticated modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and precise capture of molecular fragment contributions make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.</description>
