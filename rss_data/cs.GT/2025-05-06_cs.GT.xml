      <title>Coevolution of Actions and Opinions in Networks of Coordinating and Anti-Coordinating Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of coordinating and anti-coordinating agents in a coevolutionary model for actions and opinions. In the model, the individuals of a population interact on a two-layer network, sharing their opinions and observing others' action, while revising their own opinions and actions according to a game-theoretic mechanism, grounded in the social psychology literature. First, we consider the scenario of coordinating agents, where convergence to a Nash equilibrium (NE) is guaranteed. We identify conditions for reaching consensus configurations and establish regions of attraction for these equilibria. Second, we study networks of anti-coordinating agents. In this second scenario, we prove that all trajectories converge to a NE by leveraging potential game theory. Then, we establish analytical conditions on the network structure and model parameters to guarantee the existence of consensus and polarized equilibria, characterizing their regions of attraction.</description>

      <title>Truthful Facility Location with Candidate Locations and Limited Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a truthful facility location problem where one out of $k\geq2$ available facilities must be built at a location chosen from a set of candidate ones in the interval $[0,1]$. This decision aims to accommodate a set of agents with private positions in $[0,1]$ and approval preferences over the facilities; the agents act strategically and may misreport their private information to maximize their utility, which depends on the chosen facility and their distance from it. We focus on strategyproof mechanisms that incentivize the agents to act truthfully and bound the best possible approximation of the optimal social welfare (the total utility of the agents) they can achieve. We first show that deterministic mechanisms have unbounded approximation ratio, and then present a randomized mechanism with approximation ratio $k$, which is tight even when agents may only misreport their positions. For the restricted setting where agents may only misreport their approval preferences, we design a deterministic mechanism with approximation ratio of roughly $2.325$, and establish lower bounds of $3/2$ and $6/5$ for deterministic and randomized mechanisms, respectively.</description>

      <title>Airdrop Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Launching a new blockchain system or application is frequently facilitated by a so called airdrop, where the system designer chooses a pre-existing set of potentially interested parties and allocates newly minted tokens to them with the expectation that they will participate in the system - such engagement, especially if it is of significant level, facilitates the system and raises its value and also the value of its newly minted token, hence benefiting the airdrop recipients. A number of challenging questions befuddle designers in this setting, such as how to choose the set of interested parties and how to allocate tokens to them. To address these considerations we put forward a game-theoretic model for such airdrop games. Our model can be used to guide the designer's choices based on the way the system's value depends on participation (modeled by a ''technology function'' in our framework) and the costs that participants incur. We identify both bad and good equilibria and identify the settings and the choices that can be made where the designer can influence the players towards good equilibria in an expedient manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two variants of a deterministic multi-round, zero-sum, two-player game are presented: a turn-alternating version and an non-alternating version. The non-alternating version occurs in the computation of the covering radius of constrained systems, a quantity of interest in coding theory.</description>

      <title>Allocation of Heterogeneous Resources in General Lotto Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The allocation of resources plays an important role in the completion of system objectives and tasks, especially in the presence of strategic adversaries. Optimal allocation strategies are becoming increasingly more complex, given that multiple heterogeneous types of resources are at a system planner's disposal. In this paper, we focus on deriving optimal strategies for the allocation of heterogeneous resources in a well-known competitive resource allocation model known as the General Lotto game. In standard formulations, outcomes are determined solely by the players' allocation strategies of a common, single type of resource across multiple contests. In particular, a player wins a contest if it sends more resources than the opponent. Here, we propose a multi-resource extension where the winner of a contest is now determined not only by the amount of resources allocated, but also by the composition of resource types that are allocated. We completely characterize the equilibrium payoffs and strategies for two distinct formulations. The first consists of a weakest-link/best-shot winning rule, and the second considers a winning rule based on a weighted linear combination of the allocated resources. We then consider a scenario where the resource types are costly to purchase, and derive the players' equilibrium investments in each of the resource types.</description>

      <title>Smooth Quadratic Prediction Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When agents trade in a Duality-based Cost Function prediction market, they collectively implement the learning algorithm Follow-The-Regularized-Leader. We ask whether other learning algorithms could be used to inspire the design of prediction markets. By decomposing and modifying the Duality-based Cost Function Market Maker's (DCFMM) pricing mechanism, we propose a new prediction market, called the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market, the incentivizes agents to collectively implement general steepest gradient descent. Relative to the DCFMM, the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market has a better worst-case monetary loss for AD securities while preserving axiom guarantees such as the existence of instantaneous price, information incorporation, expressiveness, no arbitrage, and a form of incentive compatibility. To motivate the application of the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market, we independently examine agents' trading behavior under two realistic constraints: bounded budgets and buy-only securities. Finally, we provide an introductory analysis of an approach to facilitate adaptive liquidity using the Smooth Quadratic AD Prediction Market. Our results suggest future designs where the price update rule is separate from the fee structure, yet guarantees are preserved.</description>

      <title>Single-Sample and Robust Online Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Resource Allocation problem is a central problem in many areas of Computer Science, Operations Research, and Economics. In this problem, we sequentially receive $n$ stochastic requests for $m$ kinds of shared resources, where each request can be satisfied in multiple ways, consuming different amounts of resources and generating different values. The goal is to achieve a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation to the hindsight optimum, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a small constant, assuming each resource has a large budget.
  In this paper, we investigate the learnability and robustness of online resource allocation. Our primary contribution is a novel Exponential Pricing algorithm with the following properties: 1. It requires only a \emph{single sample} from each of the $n$ request distributions to achieve a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation for online resource allocation with large budgets. Such an algorithm was previously unknown, even with access to polynomially many samples, as prior work either assumed full distributional knowledge or was limited to i.i.d.\,or random-order arrivals. 2. It is robust to corruptions in the outliers model and the value augmentation model. Specifically, it maintains its $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation guarantee under both these robustness models, resolving the open question posed in Argue, Gupta, Molinaro, and Singla (SODA'22). 3. It operates as a simple item-pricing algorithm that ensures incentive compatibility.
  The intuition behind our Exponential Pricing algorithm is that the price of a resource should adjust exponentially as it is overused or underused. It differs from conventional approaches that use an online learning algorithm for item pricing. This departure guarantees that the algorithm will never run out of any resource, but loses the usual no-regret properties of online learning algorithms, necessitating a new analytical approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Market Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous All-Pay Auctions with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The all-pay auction, a classic competitive model, is widely applied in scenarios such as political elections, sports competitions, and research and development, where all participants pay their bids regardless of winning or losing. However, in the traditional all-pay auction, players have no budget constraints, whereas in real-world scenarios, players typically face budget constraints. This paper studies the Nash equilibrium of two players with budget constraints across multiple heterogeneous items in a complete-information framework. The main contributions are as follows: (1) a comprehensive characterization of the Nash equilibrium in single-item auctions with asymmetric budgets and valuations; (2) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the two-item scenario; and (3) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the three-item scenario. Unlike the unconstrained all-pay auction, which always has a Nash equilibrium, a Nash equilibrium may not exist when players have budget constraints. Our findings highlight the intricate effects of budget constraints on bidding strategies, providing new perspectives and methodologies for theoretical analysis and practical applications of all-pay auctions.</description>

Abstract: We consider two games proposed by Erd\H{o}s, and one game by Bensmail and Mc Inerney, all with the same setup of two players alternately colouring one edge of a clique. We give observations and particular behaviour for each of these problems, and prove a first reduction towards confirming the conjecture by Bensmail and Mc Inerney. We state a conjecture for Erd\H{o}s' game on the largest induced maximum degree, and extensions to edge-transitive and, respectively, regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fair division of indivisible goods is not only a subject of theoretical research, but also an important problem in practice, with solutions being offered on several online platforms. Little is known, however, about the characteristics of real-world allocation instances and how they compare to synthetic instances. Using dimensionality reduction, we compute a map of allocation instances: a 2-dimensional embedding such that an instance's location on the map is predictive of the instance's origin and other key instance features. Because the axes of this map closely align with the utility matrix's two largest singular values, we define a second, explicit map, which we theoretically characterize.</description>

      <title>The Weihrauch degree of finding Nash equilibria in multiplayer games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there an algorithm that takes a game in normal form as input, and outputs a Nash equilibrium? If the payoffs are integers, the answer is yes, and lot of work has been done in its computational complexity. If the payoffs are permitted to be real numbers, the answer is no, for continuity reasons. It is worthwhile to investigate the precise degree of non-computability (the Weihrauch degree), since knowing the degree entails what other approaches are available (eg, is there a randomized algorithm with positive success change?). The two player case has already been fully classified, but the multiplayer case remains open and is addressed here. Our approach involves classifying the degree of finding roots of polynomials, and lifting this to systems of polynomial inequalities via cylindrical algebraic decomposition.</description>
