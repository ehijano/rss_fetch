      <title>BNSR-Invariants of Surface Houghton Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface Houghton groups $\mathcal{H}_{n}$ are a family of groups generalizing Houghton groups $H_n$, which are constructed as asymptotically rigid mapping class groups. We give a complete computation of the BNSR-invariants $\Sigma^{m}(P\mathcal{H}_{n})$ of their intersection with the pure mapping class group. To do so, we prove that the associated Stein--Farley cube complex is CAT(0), and we adapt Zaremsky's method for computing the BNSR-invariants of the Houghton groups. As a consequence, we give a criterion for when subgroups of $H_n$ and $P\mathcal{H}_{n}$ having the same finiteness length as their parent group are finite index. We also discuss the failure of some of these groups to be co-Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Crossing number of curves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systems of simple closed curves on surfaces and their total number of intersection points, their so-called crossing number. For a fixed number of curves, we aim to minimise the crossing number. We determine the minimal crossing number of up to 12 curves on a surface of genus 2 and prove that minimising systems are unique up to homeomorphisms of the surface and isotopies of curves.</description>

      <title>Infinite Translation Surfaces in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book explores infinite-type translation surfaces and is intended as an introductory text for graduate and PhD students, as well as a reference for more advanced researchers.
  Chapter 1 introduces the three definitions of translation surfaces and meticulously proves their equivalence. It is enriched with numerous examples that are revisited throughout the book.
  Chapter 2 provides a detailed examination of the topological classification of infinite-type surfaces, the construction of infinite coverings of finite-type translation surfaces, and the structure of points within the metric completion.
  Chapter 3 investigates the affine symmetries of infinite-type translation surfaces, with special emphasis on infinite coverings of finite-type surfaces, the Hooper-Thurston-Veech construction, and affine homeomorphisms of finite-area infinite-type translation surfaces.
  Chapter 4 introduces infinite interval exchange transformations and employs them to demonstrate that the dynamics of translation flows are significantly more complex in the infinite-type context.
  The two appendices address hyperbolic geometry and the spectra of infinite graphs, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Wrappingness and Trunkenness of Volume-Preserving Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link invariants of long pieces of orbits of a volume-preserving flow can be used to define diffeomorphism invariants of the flow. In this paper, we extend the notions of wrapping number and trunk and define invariants of links with respect to a fibration on a 3-manifold. Extending work of Dehornoy and Rechtman, we apply this to define diffeomorphism invariants wrappingness and trunkenness of volume-preserving flows on 3-manifolds and interpret these invariants as obstructions to the existence of a global surface of section for the flow. Finally, we construct flows and show that wrappingness and trunkenness are not functions of the helicity of a flow.</description>

      <title>Constructions of symplectic forms on 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a symplectic 4-manifold $(X,\omega)$ with rational symplectic form, Auroux constructed branched coverings to $(CP^2,\omega_{FS})$. By modifying a previous construction of Lambert-Cole--Meier--Starkston, we prove that the branch locus in $CP^2$ can be assumed holomorphic in a neighborhood of the spine of the standard trisection of $CP^2$. Consequently, the symplectic 4-manifold $(X,\omega)$ admits a cohomologous symplectic form that is K\"ahler in a neighborhood of the 2-skeleton of $X$. We define the Picard group of holomorphic line bundles over the holomorphic 2-skeleton. We then investigate Hodge theory and apply harmonic spinors to construct holomorphic sections over the K\"ahler subset.</description>

      <title>Multiple correlations of spectra for higher rank Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe multiple correlations of Jordan and Cartan spectra for any finite number of Anosov representations of a finitely generated group. This extends our previous work on correlations of length and displacement spectra for rank one convex cocompact representations. Examples include correlations of the Hilbert length spectra for convex projective structures on a closed surface as well as correlations of eigenvalue gaps and singular value gaps for Hitchin representations. We relate the correlation problem to the counting problem for Jordan and Cartan projections of an Anosov subgroup with respect to a family of carefully chosen truncated {\it hypertubes}, rather than in tubes as in our previous work. Hypertubes go to infinity in a linear subspace of directions, while tubes go to infinity in a single direction and this feature presents a novel difficulty in this higher rank correlation problem.</description>

      <title>Symplectic forms on trisected 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously work of the author with Meier and Starkston showed that every closed symplectic manifold $(X,\omega)$ with a rational symplectic form admits a trisection compatible with the symplectic topology. In this paper, we describe the converse direction and give explicit criteria on a trisection of a closed, smooth 4-manifold $X$ that allows one to construct a symplectic structure on $X$. Combined, these give a new characterization of 4-manifolds that admit symplectic structures. This construction motivates several problems on taut foliations, the Thurston norm and contact geometry in 3-dimensions by connecting them to questions about the existence, classification and uniqueness of symplectic structures on 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Augmentations, annuli, and Alexander polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.09733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The augmentation variety of a knot is the locus, in the 3-dimensional coefficient space of the knot contact homology dg-algebra, where the algebra admits a unital chain map to the complex numbers. We explain how to express the Alexander polynomial of a knot in terms of the augmentation variety: it is the exponential of the integral of a ratio of two partial derivatives. The expression is derived from a description of the Alexander polynomial as a count of Floer strips and holomorphic annuli, in the cotangent bundle of Euclidean 3-space, stretching between a Lagrangian with the topology of the knot complement and the zero-section, and from a description of the boundary of the moduli space of such annuli with one positive puncture.</description>
