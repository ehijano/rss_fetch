      <title>Shedding Infrared Light on QCD Axion and ALP Dark Matter with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new chapter in infrared astronomy. Besides the discovery and a deeper understanding of various astrophysical sources, JWST can also uncover the non-gravitational nature of dark matter (DM). If DM is QCD axion or an eV-scale Axion-like particle (ALP), it can decay into two photons in the infrared band. This will produce a distinct line signature in the spectroscopic observations made by JWST. Using the latest NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations from JWST, we put the strongest bound on the photon coupling for QCD axion/ ALP DM in the mass range between 0.47 and 2.55 eV. In particular, we are able to probe a new mass range for ALP DM between $\sim$ 0.47 eV to 0.78 eV beyond what can be probed by globular cluster observations. We constrain well-motivated and UV complete models of QCD axion and ALP DM, including predictions from some models derived from string theory and/ or various Grand Unification scenarios. Future JWST observations of DM-rich systems with a better understanding of the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds can thus enable us to potentially discover QCD axion and ALP DM.

      <title>Impacts of Primordial Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work presented in this thesis draws back the curtain on the physics of the primordial universe by leveraging Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as cosmological probes. The violent deaths of ultralight PBHs are shown to severely inhibit leptogenesis, alter the sphaleron freeze-out temperature and provide an opportunity to rule out models of leptogenesis which would otherwise evade direct detection experiments for effective eternity. Turning to the extreme temperature gradients of hot spots, the evolution and formation of hot spots was considered in an expanding background for the first time, and a formalism treating the propagation of Hawking radiation was introduced. Upon addressing the previously unexplored effects of hot spots on Hawking radiation, it was discovered that hot spots can support successful leptogenesis after sphaleron freeze-out, and efficiently absorb radiated Dark Matter. These examples hint at an intricate, rich tapestry of physics in hot spots.</description>

      <title>Quantum contextuality of spin-1 massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. Contrary to entanglement, which can only exist in composite systems, contextuality is also present for single entities. The case of a three-level system is of particular interest because--in agreement with the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem--it is the simplest in which quantum contextuality is necessarily present. We verify that the polarizations of spin-1 massive particles produced at collider experiments indeed exhibit contextuality. To this purpose we consider $W$ gauge bosons produced in top-quark decays, $J/\psi$ and $K^{*}(892)^0$ mesons created in $B$-meson decays and $\phi$ mesons resulting from $\chi^0_c$ charmonium decays, making use of the data collected and analyzed by the ATLAS, LHCb and BESIII collaborations, respectively. The polarizations of all these four particles show contextuality with a significance of more than $5\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Modular $S_{3}$ flavoured Pati-Salam model with two family seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified model of quarks and leptons with modular $S_3$ flavour symmetry, where the two lightest family masses are naturally suppressed via a Pati-Salam version of the type I seesaw mechanism, mediated through heavier vector-like fermions. Majorana neutrino masses are further suppressed through a double seesaw mechanism. The viable parameter space has a preferred range of the modulus field with Im$(\tau) \sim 2 $, leading to successful fermion masses and mixing.
  The prediction for neutrinoless double beta decay is partly within the reach of the nEXO experiment. In particular, the Dirac CP violating neutrino oscillation phase is predicted to lie in the range
  $\delta_{\rm CP}^{\nu}\sim 260^o-360^o$.</description>

      <title>Advances in Local Analytic Sector Subtraction: massive NLO and elements of NNLO automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present a number of developments within the scheme of Local Analytic Sector Subtraction for infrared divergences in QCD. First, we extend the scheme to deal with next-to-leading-order (NLO) singularities related to massive QCD particles in the final state. Then, we document a new implementation of the NLO subtraction scheme in the MADNKLO automated numerical framework, which is constructed to host higher-order subtraction algorithms. In particular, we discuss improvements in its performances with respect to the original implementation. Finally we describe the MADNKLO implementation of the first elements relevant to Local Analytic Sector Subtraction at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), in the case of massless QCD partons in the final state.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gravitational particle production: Starobinsky vs Bogolyubov, uncertainties, and issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study production of free and feebly interacting scalars during inflation using the Bogolyubov coefficient and Starobinsky stochastic approaches. While the two methods agree in the limit of infinitely long inflation, the Starobinsky approach is more suitable for studying realistic situations, where the duration of inflation is finite and the scalar field has non-trivial initial conditions. We find that the abundance of produced particles is sensitive to pre-inflationary initial conditions, resulting in the uncertainty of many orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, a lower bound on the particle abundance can be obtained. High scale inflation is very efficient in particle production, which leads to strong constraints on the existence of stable scalars with masses below the inflationary Hubble rate. For example, free stable scalars are allowed only if they have masses below an eV or the reheating temperature is in the GeV range or below. We find universal scaling behavior of the particle abundance, which covers free and feebly interacting scalars as well as those with a small non-minimal coupling to gravity. These considerations are important in the context of non-thermal dark matter since inflationary particle production provides an irreducible background for other production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Meson Mixing Bounds on $Z^{\prime}$ Mass in the Alignment Limit: Establishing the Phenomenological Viability of the 331 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the 331 model with right-handed neutrinos (331RHNs), analyzing constraints on the $Z^\prime$ boson mass from $K$-, $D$-, $B_d$-, and $B_s$-meson oscillations. By explicitly incorporating scalar sector dynamics and quark rotation ambiguities ($V_L^{u,d}$), we demonstrate that $Z^\prime$ mass limits depend critically on the parametrization of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix factors. Three scenarios are explored: (i) $V_L^u = V_\text{CKM}^\dagger$ (FCNCs restricted to $D$-mesons), (ii) $V_L^d = V_\text{CKM}$ (dominant $B_s$ constraints), and (iii) a hybrid mixing pattern. Strikingly, scenario (i) reduces the $Z^\prime$ mass bound to $M_{Z^\prime} \gtrsim 600\;\text{GeV}$-two orders of magnitude below literature values-by leveraging large experimental uncertainties in $D$-$\bar{D}$ oscillations. Conversely, scenario (ii) requires $M_{Z^\prime} \gtrsim 165\;\text{TeV}$ due to stringent $B_s$ data. We further establish the alignment limit $\cos(\phi+\varphi) = 0$ for the SM-like Higgs, showing its viability depends on $V_L^{u,d}$ configurations, with $B_s$ systems enforcing $|\cos(\phi+\varphi)| &lt; 0.01$ in down-sector FCNC scenarios. Our analysis reveals that strategic choices of quark mixing matrices can suppress FCNC visibility, reconciling the 331 framework with flavor data without ultra-heavy $Z^\prime$ bosons. This work provides the first unified treatment of SM-like Higgs- and $Z^\prime$-mediated FCNCs in 331 models, identifying viable parameter spaces for collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Strong CWoLa: Binary Classification Without Background Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have been successful in the field of high energy physics, and the trend within the field is to move away from high level reconstructed variables to lower level, higher dimensional features. Supervised methods require labelled data, which is typically provided by a simulator. As the number of features increases, simulation accuracy decreases, leading to greater domain shift between training and testing data when using lower-level features. This work demonstrates that the classification without labels paradigm can be used to remove the need for background simulation when training supervised classifiers. This can result in classifiers with higher performance on real data than those trained on simulated data.</description>

      <title>Systematics of doubly heavy tetraquarks: nonstrange and strange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masses, magnetic moments and color-spin structures of nonstrange and strange tetraquarks with two heavy quarks are systematically studied in QCD string picture with chromomagnetic interaction. Our mass computations combined with weak and radiative decays indicate that there are two doubly-heavy tetraquarks, the bottom-charmed tetraquark $T_{cb}(7173,01^+)^0$ and the doubly-bottom tetraquark $T_{bb}(10406,01^+)^-$, to be stable against the strong decay, having the lifetimes of $0.069$ fs and $326$ fs, respectively. Magnetic moments are also computed and found to be sensitive to chromomagnetic mixing of the color-spin configurations of these tetraquarks, being valuable probe to experimentally detect the nontrivial color configuration $6_{c}\otimes\bar{6}_{c}$.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Violation of Z Gauge Boson Decays in Supersymmetric Type-III Seesaw Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the lepton flavor violation (LFV) of Z gauge boson decaying into two different flavor charged leptons $Z\longrightarrow l_i l_j$ ($Z\longrightarrow \tau \mu$, $Z\longrightarrow \tau e$ and $Z\longrightarrow \mu e$). This work is performed in the framework of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) which is extended by the type-III seesaw mechanism. By considering constraints from the current experimental bounds on neutrino and supersymmetric particle masses, we calculate the branching ratios of the LFV of Z boson decays. The numerical results are found to be $1.30 \times {10}^{-9}$ for both the $\tau \mu$ and $\tau e$ decay channels and $6.40 \times {10}^{-10}$ for the $\mu e$ channel. After applying the constraints from the experimental bounds on the radiative two body decays $l_{i}\rightarrow l_{j} \gamma$, the branching ratios of the LFV of Z boson decays get an additional suppression of $10^{-3}$ for the $\tau \mu$ and $\tau e$ decay channels and $10^{-8}$ for the $\mu e$ channel. The prediction of the branching ratios is found to be several orders of magnitude below the current experimental bounds for both scenarios. Thus the LFV of Z boson decays could be observed with low likelihood in the future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Suppression of elliptic anisotropy inside jets: A new perspective for jet quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle azimuthal anisotropies inside jets, defined within the momentum plane perpendicular to the jet axis, carry the information of the QCD cascade process for jet formation. In this work, we propose to measure the medium-induced modifications of the elliptic anisotropy inside jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to provide novel insight into the jet quenching phenomenon. By simulating the jet propagation in the hot and dense nuclear medium with a Linear Boltzmann Transport model, we observe a de-correlation in the two-particle azimuthal angular distribution for inclusive jet production in AA collisions relative to that in pp collisions, which results in significant suppression of the in-jet elliptic anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. This phenomenon arises from the stochastic and strong interactions with the thermal QGP medium undergone by the jet particles. Furthermore, the nuclear modifications of the in-jet $v_2$ are found to be sensitive to the medium properties in the model study, which provide a potential probe for the jet tomography of nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new, state-of-the-art predictions for the associated production of the SM Higgs boson with top quarks, computed in accordance with the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group. The NNLO QCD predictions, derived through suitable approximations of the two-loop virtual contribution, are supplemented with soft-gluon resummation up to NNLL accuracy. Two distinct resummation frameworks are employed - one based on direct QCD and the other on soft-collinear effective theory - and their features are compared in detail. These results are further combined with the complete-NLO corrections, yielding the most precise SM predictions for this process to date. The relevant sources of theoretical uncertainties are thoroughly estimated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Two- and Three-gluon Glueballs within the Helicity Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both positive and negative charge conjugation glueball spectra are computed with a constituent gluon approach. We first compute the spectrum of the Hamiltionian describing two-gluon bound states having $C=+$, before tackling the three-gluon bound states having $C=-$. We review the construction of two and three particle helicity states in order to build totally symmetric wave functions for our glueball states. In the literature, two different couplings schemes are used to build three particles states. We derive for the first time the relation between these two three-body state definitions. The glueball spectra are compared with those obtained from quantum chromodynamics simulations on a lattice. The two-gluon glueball spectra show a good agreement with the constituent approach and the numerical lattice simulations. The three-gluon spectrum is in overall agreement with the masses observed on the lattice but also predicts additional low-lying states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the thermal effects into the $e^{+}e^{-}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ scattering in a non-hermitian extension of QED. We compute the thermal contributions to this scattering cross-section within the Thermo Field Dynamics approach. In order to highlight the non-hermitian effects we have considered some limits of interest: i) zero-temperature limit and high-energy limit and ii) high-temperature regime. Since this type of scattering possesses accurate experimental data for the cross-section (for muon and tau at the final state) it can be used to set stringent bounds upon the non-hermitian parameters.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption in a Doubly Special Relativity Model with Undeformed Free Propagation and Total Momentum Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of a dynamical framework within doubly special relativity theories has impeded the development of a corresponding phenomenology of modified interactions. In this work we show that in a model based on the classical basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e and total momentum conservation, one has a well-defined cross section of the photon-photon annihilation process, once a prescription for the channel treatment is set. The modification of the interaction can lead to observable effects in the opacity of the Universe to very high-energy gamma rays when the gamma-ray energy approaches the energy scale of the deformation. The magnitude and observability of this deformation are examined as functions of the gamma-ray energy and source distance.</description>

      <title>Open Heavy flavour mesons in hot asymmetric strange hadronic matter -- a QCD sum rule approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-medium masses of the pseudoscalar open charm ($D$, $\bar D$, $D_s$ and $\bar {D_s}$) and open bottom ($B$, $\bar B$, $B_s$ and $\bar {B_s}$) mesons in hot asymmetric strange hadronic matter are studied within a QCD sum rule approach. These are computed using the medium modifications of the light quark condensates ($\langle{\bar{q_i}}{q_i}\rangle$, with $(q_i,i=1,2,3)\equiv(u,d,s)$), the scalar gluon condensate, $\left\langle \frac{\alpha_{s}}{\pi} G^a_{\mu\nu} {G^a}^{\mu\nu} \right\rangle$, the twist-2 tensorial gluon operator, $\left\langle \frac{\alpha_{s}}{\pi} \Big (G^a_{\mu\sigma} {{G^a}_\nu}^{\sigma} u^\mu u^\nu -\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\mu\sigma} {G^a}^{\mu \sigma}\Big) \right\rangle$ (where $u^\mu$ is the 4-velocity of the medium) and other operators in the operator product expansion upto mass dimension 5. Within a chiral SU(3) model, the quark condensates are obtained from the medium modifications of the non-strange and strange scalar-isoscalar fields ($\sigma$ and $\zeta$), and the scalar-isovector field, $\delta$, whereas, the gluon (scalar and twist-2) condensates are computed from the in-medium value of the dilaton field, $\chi$, which is incorporated within the chiral model to mimic the broken scale invariance of QCD. The mixed quark-gluon condensate $\langle \bar {q_i} g_s \sigma . G q_i \rangle$ is calculated from the in-medium quark condensate $\langle \bar {q_i} q_i \rangle$. The splittings of the masses of the $D-\bar D$ ($B-\bar B)$, as well as $D_s-\bar {D_s} (B_s-\bar {B_s})$ in the hadronic medium are due to the odd part of the spectral function. The effects of density, isospin asymmetry, strangeness and temperature on the masses of the open charm and open bottom mesons are observed to be appreciable.</description>

      <title>Towards a general subtraction formula for NNLO QCD corrections to processes at hadron colliders: final states with quarks and gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the calculation of integrated subtraction terms in the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme for hadron collider processes with quarks and gluons, thereby extending the results presented in Ref.$~$[1]. Although this extension eventually proves to be straightforward, it requires a more careful treatment of certain collinear limits to achieve a compact and physically-transparent final result. We also show that the cancellation of infrared divergences can be organized in such a way that, once soft contributions are removed, it occurs independently for each of the external partons. We consider these results to be important stepping stones on the way to deriving finite remainders of the integrated subtraction terms for fully-general hadron collider processes in the context of the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme.</description>

      <title>Study of hadron interactions and compositeness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plenty of hadrons have been established experimentally, yet the nonperturbative nature of the strong interaction complicates a comprehensive understanding of their internal structure, particularly for exotic hadrons that extend beyond conventional mesons and baryons. One prominent candidate for the internal structure of exotic hadrons is the hadronic molecule, a loosely bound system of hadrons analogous to atomic nuclei. Understanding such systems requires precise knowledge of hadron interactions, which traditional scattering experiments struggle to provide, especially in the low-energy region. Recent advances, including precise baryon-baryon interaction measurements, femtoscopy techniques that probe momentum correlations between particles, and first-principles lattice QCD calculations, have significantly improved our understanding of hadron interactions. Here, we review these recent developments, demonstrate the successful application of femtoscopy to antikaon-nucleon interactions, utilize the concept of compositeness to quantify the hadronic molecular component of the Lambda(1405), and discuss both experimental and theoretical prospects, including future studies at J-PARC.</description>

      <title>A spacetime model for the perturbative swing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of a new colour reconnection model in PYTHIA where the full spacetime separation between partons constrains the reconnection probability throughout the final-state radiative shower. Building upon previous ideas of a perturbative dipole-based model, our objective is to introduce realistic spatially-based colour reconnections within the Angantyr model for heavy-ion collisions. Previous models were limited to the use of a rudimentary separation measure in the transverse plane to control reconnections. We investigate the impact of this novel scheme on final states in $\text{e}^+\text{e}^-$, pp, and pPb collisions as well as in PbPb collision systems and our main goal in this paper is to achieve a reasonable description of basic multiplicities in systems of varying sizes.</description>

      <title>No Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky Upholds Lorentz Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) would upend the foundations of modern physics. Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector. We examine an understudied yet phenomenologically rich LIV signature: compass asymmetries, where neutrinos of different flavors propagate preferentially along different directions. Using the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the abundances of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$ across the sky, we find no evidence of LIV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events. Thus, we place upper limits on the values of hundreds of LIV parameters with operator dimensions 2-8, tightening existing limits by orders of magnitude and bounding hundreds of parameters for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^9 \, \text{g}$, which evaporated before the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, can induce significant isocurvature perturbations due to their biased clustering amplitude and the branching ratio of the Hawking radiation differing from the abundance ratio. By leveraging the upper bound on the isocurvature perturbations from the cosmic microwave background anisotropies reported by the Planck collaboration, we derive a new upper bound on the abundance of these light PBHs.</description>

      <title>Probing Benchmark Models of Hidden-Sector Dark Matter with DAMIC-M</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles interacting with electrons using the DAMIC-M prototype detector at the Modane Underground Laboratory. The data feature a significantly lower detector single $e^-$ rate (factor 50) compared to our previous search, while also accumulating a ten times larger exposure of $\sim$1.3 kg-day. DM interactions in the skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) are searched for as patterns of two or three consecutive pixels with a total charge between 2 and 4 $e^-$. We find 144 candidates of 2 $e^-$ and 1 candidate of 4 $e^-$, where 141.5 and 0.071, respectively, are expected from background. With no evidence of a DM signal, we place stringent constraints on DM particles with masses between 1 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$ interacting with electrons through an ultra-light or heavy mediator. For large ranges of DM masses below 1 GeV/c$^2$, we exclude theoretically-motivated benchmark scenarios where hidden-sector particles are produced as a major component of DM in the Universe through the freeze-in or freeze-out mechanisms.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Very-High-Energy Diffuse $\gamma$-Ray Emission: The Case for Galactic Source Cocoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The secondary/primary cosmic-ray ratios and the diffuse backgrounds of gamma rays and neutrinos provide us with complementary information about the transport of Galactic cosmic rays. We use the recent measurement of the diffuse gamma ray background in the $\sim \rm TeV -\rm PeV$ range by LHAASO and of the very high energy diffuse neutrino background from the Galactic disc by IceCube to show that CRs may be accumulating an approximately energy independent grammage $X\sim 0.4\, \rm g \, \rm cm^{-2}$, in regions where gamma rays and neutrinos are produced with a hard spectrum, resembling the source spectrum. We speculate that this grammage reflects the early stages of cosmic ray transport around sources, in so-called cocoons, where particles spend $\sim 0.3\, \rm Myr$ before starting their journey in the Galactic environment.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Improved Lattice QCD $B_c\to J/\psi$ Vector, Axial-Vector, and Tensor Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an update of HPQCD's lattice QCD determination of the $B_c\to J/\psi$ vector and axial-vector form factors, and provide new results for the tensor form factors. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action for all valence quarks, together with the second generation MILC $n_f=2+1+1$ HISQ gluon field configurations. This calculation includes two additional ensembles, one with physically light up and down quarks and $a\approx 0.06 \mathrm{fm}$ and one with $a\approx 0.03\mathrm{fm}$ on which we are able to reach the physical bottom quark mass. Our calculation uses nonperturbatively renormalised current operators and covers the full kinematical range of the decay. We use our recent results for the heavy-charm susceptibilities, as a function of $u=m_c/m_h$, in order to employ the full dispersive parameterisation for $B_c\to J/\psi$ in our physical-continuum extrapolation. We give updated SM predictions $R(J/\psi)=0.2597(27)$, $A_{\lambda_\tau}=0.5093(42)$, $F_L^{J/\psi}=0.4421(55)$, and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{FB}=-0.0567(61)$, reducing uncertainties by $29\%$, $45\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ respectively. Since our lattice form factors cover the full kinematic range we can use them to test extrapolations using data in a truncated range, at low-recoil. We investigate different physical continuum parameterisation schemes, with lattice results in the first $1/3$ of the kinematic range near $q^2_\mathrm{max}$. We find that unexpectedly large systematic uncertainties near $q^2=0$ can emerge when extrapolating synthetic data in the high-$q^2$ region if higher order kinematical terms are omitted from the physical continuum extrapolation. This suggests a potentially underestimated systematic uncerainty entering extrapolations of synthetic lattice QCD data for the related $B\to D^*\ell\bar{\nu}$ decay from the high-$q^2$ region into the low-$q^2$ region.</description>

We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>

      <title>Primordial correlators from multi-point propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key step in the comparison between inflationary predictions and cosmological observations is the computation of primordial correlators. Numerical methods have been developed that overcome some of the difficulties arising in analytical calculations when the models considered are complex. The PyTransport package, which implements the transport formalism, allows computation of the tree-level 2- and 3-point correlation functions for multi-field models with arbitrary potentials and a curved field space. In this work we investigate an alternative numerical implementation of the transport approach, based on the use of transfer ''matrices'' called multi-point propagators (MPP). We test the novel MPP method, and extensively compare it with the traditional implementation of the transport approach provided in PyTransport. We highlight advantages of the former, discussing its performance in terms of accuracy, precision and running time, as well as dependence on the number of e-folds of sub-horizon evolution and tolerance settings. For topical ultra-slow-roll models of inflation we show that MPPs (i) precisely track the decay of correlators even when PyTransport produces erroneous results, (ii) extend the computation of squeezed bispectra for squeezing values at least one decade beyond those attainable with PyTransport.</description>

      <title>ILC sensitivity for leptophilic scalar dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the viability of detecting a leptophilic scalar dark matter at the ILC in a simplified model approach. We present the constraints on the couplings of scalar dark matter with the standard model fermions ensuing from the relic density bounds deduced from the 2018 Planck data. We, then, present the reach of the ILC in terms of $\Lambda$, the scale of the effective theory, by performing a detailed analysis for the $Z$ associated DM pair production (i.e., $ e^+ e^- \rightarrow 2 $ jets + $\not \!\! E_T$, $ e^+ e^- \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ + $\not \!\! E_T$ and $ e^+ e^- \rightarrow e^+ e^-$ + $\not \!\! E_T$). We present the results for various run scenarios as 3-$\sigma$ contours in the $m_{\phi}-\Lambda$ plane. We also analyze the effect of beam polarization on the sensitivity of this search. We find that for the process with two hadronic jets in the final state, ILC can probe $\Lambda$ up to 1.76 TeV for $\sqrt{s}= 1$ TeV that can further enhance to 1.99 TeV, after the inclusion of polarization effects.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme: NNLO QCD corrections to $N$-gluon final states in $q\bar{q}$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme [1] can be used to compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the production of an arbitrary number of gluonic jets in hadron collisions. We show that the infrared subtraction terms can be combined into recurring structures that in many cases are simple iterations of those terms known from next-to-leading order. The way that these recurring structures are identified and computed is fairly general, and can be applied to any partonic process. As an example, we explicitly demonstrate the cancellation of all singularities in the fully-differential cross section for the $q\bar{q} \to X + N g $ process at NNLO in QCD. The finite remainder of the NNLO QCD contribution, which arises upon cancellation of all $\epsilon$-poles, is expressed via relatively simple formulas, which can be implemented in a numerical code in a straightforward way. Our approach can be extended to describe arbitrary processes at NNLO in QCD; the largest remaining challenge at this point is the combinatorics of quark and gluon collinear limits.</description>

Abstract: We discuss an extra-dimensional braneworld with a 5th dimension compactified on a circle. As a characteristic feature, the warp factor is hyperbolic and separates the hidden and visible branes by a bulk horizon without a singularity. The two most widely separated scales of 4D physics - the 4D Planck mass and 4D cosmological constant - are determined by two physical scales in the extra dimension, namely: $(i)$ the proper size of the extra dimension, $R$, and, $(ii)$ the distance between the visible brane and the horizon, $R_0$. A realistic scale hierarchy between 4D Planck mass and 4D cosmological constant is obtained for $R/R_0\sim2.34$. The usual fine tuning is not reduced but promoted to a fine tuning of two separate brane energy densities that must approach the fundamental scale of the model with very high precision. Our scenario is based on an exact solution to the 5D Einstein equations with a strictly empty bulk and Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric on the 4D branes. This requires positive 4D brane energy densities and describes an adiabatic runaway solution in agreement with the de Sitter swampland conjecture. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton states are solutions of a modified P\"oschl-Teller potential which permits a discrete graviton spectrum of exactly two modes. In addition to the usual massless graviton, our scenario predicts an extra massive spin-2 graviton with a mass gap of $m_1=\sqrt{2}H_0\approx2\times10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$ which might be detectable in the foreseeable future. A KK tower of gravitons, or a possible continuum of massive graviton states, is prohibited by unitarity with respect to the horizon. We discuss hurdles in turning this model into a realistic cosmology at all times, which points us towards 4D brane tensions that that must be raising towards the fundamental scale of the model, while the observable 4D expansion rate is decreasing.</description>

      <title>NSI effects on tripartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of new physics on different measures of tripartite entanglement within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. These measures encompass concurrence, entanglement of formation, and negativity. We analyze the influence of new physics on these measures across a range of experimental setups involving both reactors and accelerators. Reactor experiments under consideration include Daya Bay, JUNO, and KamLAND setups, while accelerator experiments encompass T2K, MINOS, and DUNE. Our analysis reveals that accelerator experiments demonstrate greater sensitivity to NSI, with the most pronounced impact observed in the DUNE experiment. Negativity, while a weaker metric compared to EOF and concurrence, exhibits maximal sensitivity to NSI effects, particularly evident when neutrinos possess moderate to high energies. Conversely, reactor experiments demonstrate less sensitivity to NSI, with concurrence and EOF displaying more prominent effects.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of dark matter absorption in the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nuclear absorption of dark matter as an alternative to the typical indirect detection search channels of dark matter decay or annihilation. In this scenario, an atomic nucleus transitions to an excited state by absorbing a pseudoscalar dark matter particle and promptly emits a photon as it transitions back to its ground state. The nuclear excitation of carbon and oxygen in the Galactic Center would produce a discrete photon spectrum in the $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV range that could be detected by gamma-ray telescopes. Using the \texttt{BIGSTICK} large-scale shell-model code, we calculate the excitation energies of carbon and oxygen. We constrain the dark matter-nucleus coupling for current COMPTEL data, and provide projections for future experiments AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, and GRAMS for dark matter masses from $\sim$ 10 to 30 MeV. We find the excitation process to be very sensitive to the dark matter mass and find that the future experiments considered would improve constraints on the dark matter-nucleus coupling within an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) Higgs potential is likely to be metastable, in which case Higgs Inflation requires an extension of the SM to sufficiently stabilise the Higgs potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$. We consider isosinglet $T$ and $B$ vector quarks. Requiring stability of the finite temperature effective potential, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The upper bounds are generally smaller for $B$ vector quarks and are sensitive to the $t$-quark mass. The inflation predictions depend upon the conformal frame in which the model is renormalised. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger upper bound on $m_{Q}$ in Prescription II than the requirement of stability. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Resonant leptogenesis in minimal $U(1)_X$ extensions of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a general $U(1)_X$ scenario where we introduce three generations of Standard Model (SM) singlet Right Handed Neutrinos (RHNs) to generate the light neutrino mass through the seesaw mechanism after the breaking of $U(1)_X$ and electroweak symmetries. In addition to that, a general $U(1)_X$ scenario involves an SM-singlet scalar field and due to the $U(1)_X$ symmetry breaking the mass of a neutral beyond the SM (BSM) gauge boson $Z^\prime$ is evolved. The RHNs, being charged under $U(1)_X$ scenario, can explain the origin of observed baryon asymmetry through the resonant leptogenesis process. Applying observed neutrino oscillation data we study $Z^\prime$ and BSM scalar induced processes to reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry. Hence we estimate bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and the mass of the $Z^\prime$ $(M_{Z^\prime})$ for different $U(1)_X$ charges and benchmark masses of RHN and SM-singlet scalar. Finally we compare our results with limits obtained from the existing limits from LEP-II and LHC. We find that depending on the $U(1)_X$ charges, the masses of RHNs and SM-singlet scalar resonant leptogenesis could provide stronger limit on $g_X$ for $M_{Z^\prime} &gt; 5.8$ TeV which could be probed by high energy scattering experiment in future.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Study of Lepton Flavor Violation in Z Boson Decays with Constrained MSSM Extended by Type-II Seesaw Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the lepton flavor violation (LFV) of Z boson decays in the framework of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) extended by the type-II seesaw model. The branching ratios of $Z\longrightarrow l_i l_j$ decays are calculated in this model. Here, $l_i$ and $l_j$ are different flavor charged leptons. After fitting to the experimental mass limits of the neutrino and supersymmetric particles, we have found that the branching ratios for LFV decays of Z boson are in the order of $6 \times {10}^{-10}$ for $e \mu$ channel and of $1 \times {10}^{-9}$ for both $\tau \mu$ and $\tau e$ decay channels. Considering recent experimental constraints on $l_{i}\rightarrow l_{j} \gamma$ decays, the branching ratios for LFV decays of Z boson get an additional suppression of $10^{-8}$ for $e \mu$ channel and of $10^{-3}$ for both $\tau \mu$ and $\tau e$ decay channels. The branching ratios theoretical predictions are several orders below the recent experimental limits for both scenarios, which give a very low probability to observe the LFV decays of Z boson in the future experiments.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm-bottom structures $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Axial-vector case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass and width of a hidden charm-bottom axial-vector structure $T$ containing $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ quarks are calculated in QCD sum rule framework. It is treated as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and axial-vector antidiquark components. The mass of $T$ is computed using the two-point sum rule method. The width of this particle is evaluated by considering eight decay modes: The decays to $\eta _{b}J/\psi $, $\eta _{c}\Upsilon (1S)$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast +}$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ are dissociation processes, in which all initial quarks are distributed between the final-state particles. The decays to $DD$ and $BB$ mesons with appropriate charges and spin-parities are channels generated due to the annihilations of $b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ quarks from $T$. Partial widths for all of these processes are obtained by employing the three-point sum rule approach necessary to find the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our results for the mass $ m=(12715\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T] =(140 \pm 13)~ \mathrm{MeV }$ of the tetraquark $T$, as well as its numerous decay channels explored in this article are useful for ongoing and future experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Double strangeness pentaquarks and other exotic hadrons in the $\Xi_b \to \Xi\ J/\Psi\ \phi$ decay</title>

Abstract: We study the possibility that four $\Xi$ resonances $(\Xi(1620)$, $\Xi(1690)$, $\Xi(1820)$, $\Xi(1950))$ could correspond to pentaquark states, in the form of meson-baryon bound systems. We also explore the possible existence of doubly strange pentaquarks with hidden charm $(P_{css})$ and find two candidates structured in a similar form, at energies of $4493~{\rm MeV}$ and $4630~{\rm MeV}$. The meson-baryon interaction is built from t-channel meson exchange processes which are evaluated using effective Lagrangians. Moreover we analyse the $\Xi_b\to\Xi~J/\psi~\phi$ decay process, which permits exploring the existence of the heavy double strange pentaquark, as well as other exotic hadrons, in the three different two-body invariant mass spectra of the emitted particles. In the $J/\psi\phi$ mass spectrum, we analyse the nature of the $X(4140)$ and $X(4160)$ resonances. In the $J/\psi\Xi$ invariant mass spectrum, we study the signal produced by the doubly strange pentaquark, where we conclude that it has a good chance to be detected in this reaction if its mass is around $4580-4680~{\rm MeV}$. Finally, in the $\phi\Xi$ spectrum we study the likelihood to detect the $\Xi(2500)$ state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton's parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions that has been experimentally confirmed. In this letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider and find good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of the quantum entanglement framework in the experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.</description>

      <title>Relativistic effects in the strong and electromagnetic decays of ${D^*}$ meson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the complete Salpeter equation and use the obtained relativistic wave function to calculate the strong and radiative electromagnetic decays of the ${D^*}$ meson. { We obtain the results $\Gamma(D^{*}(2007)^{0}\to D^{0}\pi^{0})=34.6~\rm{keV}$ and $\Gamma(D^{*}(2007)^{0}\rightarrow D^{0}\gamma)=19.4~\rm{keV}$, and the estimated full width is $\Gamma(D^{*}(2007)^{0})=54.0~\rm{keV}$.} The focus of this study is on the relativistic corrections. In our method, the wave function of the $D$ meson is not a pure $S$-wave, but includes both a non-relativistic $S$-wave and a relativistic $P$-wave, while the wave function of the $D^*$ meson includes a non-relativistic $S$-wave as well as both relativistic $P$-wave and $D$-wave. Therefore, in this case, the decay ${D^{*}\rightarrow{D}\gamma}$ is not a non-relativistic $M1$ transition, but rather an $M1+E2+M3+E4$ decay. We find that in a strong decay $D^{*}\rightarrow{D}{\pi}$, the non-relativistic contribution is dominant, while in an electromagnetic decay ${D^{*}\rightarrow{D}\gamma}$, the relativistic correction is dominant.</description>

      <title>Implications of Higgs mass for hidden sector SUSY breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hidden sector SUSY breaking where charged hidden sector fields obtain SUSY breaking vevs once seemed common in dynamical SUSY breaking (DSB). In such a case, scalars can obtain large masses but gauginos and A-terms gain loop-suppressed anomaly-mediated contributions which may be smaller by factors of 1/16\pi^2 ~1/160. This situation leads to models such as PeV or mini-split supersymmetry with m(scalars)~ 160 m(gauginos). In order to generate a light Higgs mass m_h~ 125 GeV, the scalar mass terms are required in the 10-100 TeV range, leading to large, unnatural contributions to the weak scale. Alternatively, in gravity mediation with singlet hidden sector fields, then m(scalars)~ m(gauginos)~ A-terms and the large A-terms lift m_h -&gt;125 GeV even for natural values of m(stop1)~ 1-3 TeV. Requiring naturalness, which is probabilistically preferred by the string landscape, then the measured Higgs mass seems to favor singlets in the hidden sector, which can be common in metastable and retrofitted DSB models.</description>

Abstract: We study the $P$-wave bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor antitriplet and systematically calculate their strong decay properties, including their $D$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light pseudoscalar mesons and $S$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light vector mesons. Together with Refs.~\cite{Tan:2023opd,Yang:2019cvw,Yang:2020zrh,Luo:2024jov}, a rather complete investigation has been performed to study their mass spectra and strong/radiative decay properties, through the methods of QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. Among various possibilities, we identify four $\Lambda_b$ and four $\Xi_b$ baryons, with limited decay widths and so capable of being observed in experiments. Their masses, mass splittings within the same multiplets, and strong/radiative decay widths are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:decayb3f} for future experimental searching.</description>

      <title>Impact of New Physics on Momentum-Dependent Particle Widths and Propagators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of momentum-dependent particle widths and propagators on gauge and Higgs bosons and the top quark within the Standard Model (SM) and its SMEFT extensions near thresholds. By incorporating self-energy corrections via Dyson resummation, we quantify deviations from the fixed-width approximation and assess their implications for collider observables. While effects on the Higgs boson are negligible and the $W$ boson shows percent-level deviations in reconstructed transverse mass distributions, the top quark exhibits significant sensitivity near its mass threshold. Future lepton colliders, e.g., electron-positron machines or muon colliders, can offer sensitivity to these effects, enabling constraints on SMEFT Wilson coefficients. We perform a representative case study for the precision frontier available with a staged future muon collider. Our results highlight that momentum dependencies can provide additional sensitivity at precision-era experiments, enhancing the potential for discovering new physics there.</description>

      <title>Optical gravitational waves as signals of Gravitationally-Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-lived heavy particles present during the big bang could have a decay channel opened by gravitons. Such decays can produce gravitational waves with large enough abundance to be detectable, and a peculiar narrow spectrum peaked today around optical frequencies. We identify which particles can decay in one or two gravitons. The maximal gravitational wave abundance arises from theories with extra hidden strong gauge dynamics, such as a confining pure-glue group. An interesting abundance also arises in theories with perturbative couplings. Future observation might shed light on early cosmology and allow some spectroscopy of sub-Planckian gravitationally-decaying particles, plausibly present in a variety of theories such as gauge unification, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, strings.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold states in coupled $DD^{\ast}-D^{\ast}D^{\ast}$ scattering from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first determination of doubly-charmed isospin-0 coupled-channel $DD^\ast-D^\ast D^\ast$ scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD is presented. The finite-volume spectrum is computed for three lattice volumes with a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV and is used to extract the scattering amplitudes in $J^P = 1^+$ via the L\"{u}scher quantization condition. By analytically continuing the scattering amplitudes to complex energies, a $T_{cc}$ pole corresponding to a virtual bound state is found below $DD^\ast$ threshold. We also find a second pole, $T_{cc}^\prime$, corresponding to a resonance pole below the kinematically closed $D^\ast D^\ast$ channel, to which it has a strong coupling. A non-zero coupling is robustly found between the $S$-wave $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ channels producing a clear cusp in the $D D^\ast$ amplitude at the $D^\ast D^\ast$ threshold energy. This suggests that the experimental $T_{cc}^\prime$ should be observable in $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ final states at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-precision black hole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the radiation-reacted impulse, scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a classical black hole (or neutron star) scattering event at fifth post-Minkowskian and sub-leading self-force orders (5PM-1SF). This state-of-the-art four-loop computation employs advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology, and is considerably more challenging than the conservative 5PM-1SF counterpart. As compared with the conservative 5PM-1SF, in the radiation sector Calabi-Yau three-fold periods appear and contribute to the radiated energy and recoil observables. We give an extensive exposition of the canonicalization of the differential equations and provide details on boundary integrations, Feynman rules, and integration-by-parts strategies. Comparisons to numerical relativity are also performed.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity may govern the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $% SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result -- while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$ -- only the vector submultiplet and singlet tensor field may manifest in an observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order mass. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin magnitudes, some $% SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-1/2 quarks and leptons. However, applying $% SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $% SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>Neutron emission from the photon-induced reactions in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultraperipheral collisions are the source of various interesting phenomena based on photon-induced reactions. We calculate cross sections for single and any number of n, p, $\alpha$, $\gamma$-rays in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision for LHC energies. We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02~TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which only part of photon energy $E_\gamma$ is changed into the excitation energy of the nucleus ($E_{exc} \neq E_{\gamma}$) and compare its results with outcomes of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. The role of high photon energies for small neutron multiplicities is discussed. Emission of a small number of neutrons at high photon energies seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section of four- and five-neutron emission cross sections from first principles is rather demanding. The estimated emission of charged particles such as protons, deuterons and $\alpha$ is shortly discussed and confronted with very recent ALICE data, obtained with the proton Zero Degree Calorimeter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles non-perturbative determination of the mass of the lightest gluino-gluon bound state (gluino-glue) in large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ Supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, and exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. Our large-$N$ determination is consistent with naive extrapolation of previously-known $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ results.</description>

      <title>Classification of $T^2/Z_m$ orbifold boundary conditions in $SO(N)$ gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generally classify the equivalence classes of the $T^2/Z_m$ $(m=2,3,4,6)$ orbifold boundary conditions (BCs) for the $SO(N)$ gauge group. Higher-dimensional gauge theories are defined by gauge groups, matter field contents, and the BCs. The numerous patterns of the BCs are classified into the finite equivalence classes, each of which consists of the physically equivalent BCs. In this paper, we reconstruct the canonical forms of the BCs for the $SO(N)$ gauge group through the ``re-orthogonalization method." All the possible equivalent relations between the canonical forms are examined by using the trace conservation laws. The number of the equivalence classes in each orbifold model is obtained.</description>

      <title>Two- versus three-body approach to femtoscopic hadron-deuteron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body approach to hadron-deuteron correlations is shown to turn into a two-body approach if the three-particle hadron-deuteron wave function factorizes into the deuteron wave-function and the wave function of a hadron motion relative to the deuteron. Then, the hadron-deuteron correlation function is as in the two-body approach only the source radius somewhat changes. For this reason, as we argue, the two-body approach works well for kaon-deuteron correlations but it fails for proton-deuteron ones in case of small sources. Applying the three-body approach generalized to the case where the radius of the hadron source is different from the nucleon source radius, we derive the source radius formula which used in the two-body approach gives the correlation function as in the `factorized' three-body one. The formula is discussed in the context of existing and future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the polydeterminant in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the determinant appears in particle physics in effective Lagrangian interaction terms that model the chiral anomaly in Quantum Chromodynamics (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connection to mesons. This \textit{polydeterminant function}, known in the mathematical literature as a mixed discriminant, associates $N$ distinct $N\times N$ complex matrices into a complex number and reduces to the usual determinant when all matrices are taken as equal. Here, we explore the main properties of the polydeterminant applied to (quantum) fields by using a formalism and a language close to high-energy physics approaches. We discuss its use as a tool to write down novel Lagrangian terms and present an explicit illustrative model for mesons. Finally, the extension of the polydeterminant as a function of tensors is shown.</description>

      <title>Measuring $A_\text{FB}^b$ and $R_b$ with exclusive $b$-hadron decays at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel tagging technique to measure the beauty-quark partial decay-width ratio $R_b$ and its forward-backward asymmetry $A_\text{FB}^b$ at the FCC-ee, using $\mathcal{O}(10^{12})$ $Z$-boson decays. The method is based on the exclusive reconstruction of a selected list of $b$-hadron decay modes in $Z\to b\bar{b}$ events at the $Z$ pole, which can provide the flavour and possibly the charge of the hemisphere. This approach effectively eliminates the contamination from light-quark physics events and reduces the leading systematic uncertainties arising from background contamination, tagging-efficiency correlations, and gluon-radiation corrections by exploiting the geometric and kinematic properties of beauty hadrons. This results in a total relative uncertainty of the order of $0.01\,\%$ for both observables. Furthermore, this precision allows to obtain a commensurate precision on the weak mixing angle $\sin^2(\theta_W^\text{eff})$ compared to the muon forward-backward asymmetry on the order of $0.002\,\%$.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This renormalizable model admits very large solitons, making the perturbative scattering equations highly sensitive to boundary conditions and requiring a relaxation method for their solution. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the two scalars, and solitons with lower internal frequencies lead to more peaks in the spectra of the amplification factors. Additionally, we derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap.</description>

      <title>$bb\bar u\bar d$ and $bs\bar u\bar d$ tetraquarks from lattice QCD using two-meson and diquark-antidiquark variational basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of isoscalar tetraquark systems involving bottom quarks with explicit flavor content $bb\bar{u}\bar{d}$ and $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$. In the doubly bottom sector, the study focuses on axialvector $J^P=1^+$ quantum numbers, whereas in the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel both axial vector $J^P=1^+$ and scalar $J^P=0^+$ quantum numbers are investigated in search of signatures for possible tetraquark bound states. The calculations are performed on four ensembles with dynamical quark fields up to the charm quark generated by the MILC Collaboration, with lattice spacings ranging from approximately 0.058 fm to 0.12 fm, and at different values of the valence light quark mass $m_{u/d}$, corresponding to pseudoscalar meson masses, $M_{ps}=0.5$, 0.6 and 0.7 GeV. The energy eigenvalues in the finite volume are determined by applying a variational procedure to correlation matrices constructed from two-meson interpolating operators and diquark-antidiquark operators. Continuum extrapolated elastic $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of $BB^*$, $KB^*$ and $KB$ are extracted from the ground state eigenenergies following a finite-volume analysis \'a la L\"uscher. The chiral and continuum extrapolated binding energy estimates for the isoscalar axialvector doubly bottom tetraquark $T_{bb}$ from the extracted elastic $BB^*$ $S$-wave scattering amplitudes is found to be $\Delta E_{T_{bb}}(1^+)=-116(^{+30}_{-36})$ MeV. In the $bs\bar{u}\bar{d}$, no statistically significant deviations were observed in the ground state energies from the respective elastic threshold energies, leading to no conclusive evidence for any bound states.</description>

      <title>Propagation Times and Energy Losses of Cosmic Protons and Antiprotons in Interplanetary Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the heliospheric modulation of cosmic rays in interplanetary space, focusing on their propagation times and energy losses over the solar cycle. To perform the calculations, we employed a data-driven model based on the stochastic method. Our model was calibrated using time-resolved and energy-resolved data from several missions including AMS-02, PAMELA, EPHIN/SOHO, BESS, and data from Voyager-1. This approach allows us to calculate probability density functions for the propagation time and energy losses of cosmic protons and antiprotons in the heliosphere. Furthermore, we explore the temporal evolution of these probabilities spanning from 1993 to 2018, covering a full 22-year cycle of magnetic polarity, which includes two solar minima and two magnetic reversals. Our calculations were carried out for cosmic protons and antiprotons, enabling us to investigate the role of charge-sign dependent effects in cosmic ray transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical processes of cosmic-ray propagation in the heliosphere and contribute to a deeper understanding of the solar modulation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration released the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been a speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without fixed LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>
