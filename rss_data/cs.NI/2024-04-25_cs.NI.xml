      <title>Characterizing the Age of Information with Multiple Coexisting Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the distribution of the Age of Information (AoI) of a tagged data stream sharing a processor with a set of other data streams. We do so in the highly general setting in which the interarrival times pertaining to the tagged stream can have any distribution, and also the service times of both the tagged stream and the background stream are generally distributed. The packet arrival times of the background process are assumed to constitute a Poisson process, which is justified by the fact that it typically is a superposition of many relatively homogeneous streams. The first major contribution is that we derive an expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the AoI in the resulting GI+M/GI+GI/1 model. Second, we use stochastic ordering techniques to identify tight stochastic bounds on the AoI. In addition, when approximating the tagged stream's inter-generation times through a phase-type distribution (which can be done at any precision), we present a computational algorithm for the mean AoI. As illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments, the analysis enables us to assess the impact of background traffic on the AoI of the tagged stream.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) for Optimization of Wi-Fi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs), have made significant strides in modeling complex data distributions across diverse domains. Meanwhile, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated substantial improvements in optimizing Wi-Fi network performance. Wi-Fi optimization problems are highly challenging to model mathematically, and DRL methods can bypass complex mathematical modeling, while GDMs excel in handling complex data modeling. Therefore, combining DRL with GDMs can mutually enhance their capabilities. The current MAC layer access mechanism in Wi-Fi networks is the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which dramatically declines in performance with a high number of terminals. In this paper, we apply diffusion models to deep deterministic policy gradient, namely the Deep Diffusion Deterministic Policy (D3PG) algorithm to optimize the Wi-Fi performance. Although such integrations have been explored previously, we are the first to apply it to Wi-Fi network performance optimization. We propose an access mechanism that jointly adjusts the contention window and frame length based on the D3PG algorithm. Through simulations, we have demonstrated that this mechanism significantly outperforms existing Wi-Fi standards in dense Wi-Fi scenarios, maintaining performance even as the number of users sharply increases.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy Efficiency of 5G RedCap Beam Management for Smart Agriculture Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam management in 5G NR involves the transmission and reception of control signals such as Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), crucial for tasks like initial access and/or channel estimation. However, this procedure consumes energy, which is particularly challenging to handle for battery-constrained nodes such as RedCap devices. Specifically, in this work we study a mid-market Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Agriculture (SmA) deployment where an Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV) acts as a base station "from the sky" (UAV-gNB) to monitor and control ground User Equipments (UEs) in the field. Then, we formalize a multi-variate optimization problem to determine the optimal beam management design for RedCap SmA devices in order to reduce the energy consumption at the UAV-gNB. Specifically, we jointly optimize the transmission power and the beamwidth at the UAV-gNB. Based on the analysis, we derive the so-called "regions of feasibility," i.e., the upper limit(s) of the beam management parameters for which RedCap Quality of Service (QoS) and energy constraints are met. We study the impact of factors like the total transmission power at the gNB, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) threshold for successful packet decoding, the number of UEs in the region, and the misdetection probability. Simulation results demonstrate that there exists an optimal configuration for beam management to promote energy efficiency, which depends on the speed of the UEs, the beamwidth, and other network parameters.</description>

      <title>Semantic Routing for Enhanced Performance of LLM-Assisted Intent-Based 5G Core Network Management and Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly emerging in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, especially in the fields of natural language processing and generative AI. Not limited to text generation applications, these models inherently possess the opportunity to leverage prompt engineering, where the inputs of such models can be appropriately structured to articulate a model's purpose explicitly. A prominent example of this is intent-based networking, an emerging approach for automating and maintaining network operations and management. This paper presents semantic routing to achieve enhanced performance in LLM-assisted intent-based management and orchestration of 5G core networks. This work establishes an end-to-end intent extraction framework and presents a diverse dataset of sample user intents accompanied by a thorough analysis of the effects of encoders and quantization on overall system performance. The results show that using a semantic router improves the accuracy and efficiency of the LLM deployment compared to stand-alone LLMs with prompting architectures.</description>

      <title>Security-Sensitive Task Offloading in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of sixth-generation (6G) communication technology, global communication networks are moving towards the goal of comprehensive and seamless coverage. In particular, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have become a critical component of satellite communication networks. The emergence of LEO satellites has brought about new computational resources known as the \textit{LEO satellite edge}, enabling ground users (GU) to offload computing tasks to the resource-rich LEO satellite edge. However, existing LEO satellite computational offloading solutions primarily focus on optimizing system performance, neglecting the potential issue of malicious satellite attacks during task offloading. In this paper, we propose the deployment of LEO satellite edge in an integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN) structure to support \textit{security-sensitive computing task offloading}. We model the task allocation and offloading order problem as a joint optimization problem to minimize task offloading delay, energy consumption, and the number of attacks while satisfying reliability constraints. To achieve this objective, we model the task offloading process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a security-sensitive task offloading strategy optimization algorithm based on proximal policy optimization (PPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>RSSI Estimation for Constrained Indoor Wireless Networks using ANN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the expanding field of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless channel estimation is a significant challenge. This is specifically true for low-power IoT (LP-IoT) communication, where efficiency and accuracy are extremely important. This research establishes two distinct LP-IoT wireless channel estimation models using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): a Feature-based ANN model and a Sequence-based ANN model. Both models have been constructed to enhance LP-IoT communication by lowering the estimation error in the LP-IoT wireless channel. The Feature-based model aims to capture complex patterns of measured Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data using environmental characteristics. The Sequence-based approach utilises predetermined categorisation techniques to estimate the RSSI sequence of specifically selected environment characteristics. The findings demonstrate that our suggested approaches attain remarkable precision in channel estimation, with an improvement in MSE of $88.29\%$ of the Feature-based model and $97.46\%$ of the Sequence-based model over existing research. Additionally, the comparative analysis of these techniques with traditional and other Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques also highlights the superior performance of our developed models and their potential in real-world IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for User Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have shown remarkable accuracy in localization tasks, but their dependency on vast amounts of labeled data, particularly Channel State Information (CSI) and corresponding coordinates, remains a bottleneck. Self-supervised learning techniques alleviate the need for labeled data, a potential that remains largely untapped and underexplored in existing research. Addressing this gap, we propose a pioneering approach that leverages self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled data to boost the performance of supervised learning for user localization based on CSI. We introduce two pretraining Auto Encoder (AE) models employing Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to glean representations from unlabeled data via self-supervised learning. Following this, we utilize the encoder portion of the AE models to extract relevant features from labeled data, and finetune an MLP-based Position Estimation Model to accurately deduce user locations. Our experimentation on the CTW-2020 dataset, which features a substantial volume of unlabeled data but limited labeled samples, demonstrates the viability of our approach. Notably, the dataset covers a vast area spanning over 646x943x41 meters, and our approach demonstrates promising results even for such expansive localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Feature Distribution Shift Mitigation with Contrastive Pretraining for Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Learning (DL) to solve Network Intrusion Detection (NID) problems. However, the feature distribution shift problem remains a difficulty, because the change in features' distributions over time negatively impacts the model's performance. As one promising solution, model pretraining has emerged as a novel training paradigm, which brings robustness against feature distribution shift and has proven to be successful in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). To verify whether this paradigm is beneficial for NID problem, we propose SwapCon, a ML model in the context of NID, which compresses shift-invariant feature information during the pretraining stage and refines during the finetuning stage. We exemplify the evidence of feature distribution shift using the Kyoto2006+ dataset. We demonstrate how pretraining a model with the proper size can increase robustness against feature distribution shifts by over 8%. Moreover, we show how an adequate numerical embedding strategy also enhances the performance of pretrained models. Further experiments show that the proposed SwapCon model also outperforms eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based models by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Coded Poisson Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for convolutional coded Poisson receivers (CCPRs) that incorporates spatially coupled methods into the architecture of coded Poisson receivers (CPRs). We use density evolution equations to track the packet decoding process with the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique. We derive outer bounds for the stability region of CPRs when the underlying channel can be modeled by a $\phi$-ALOHA receiver. The stability region is the set of loads that every packet can be successfully received with a probability of 1. Our outer bounds extend those of the spatially-coupled Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol and apply to channel models with multiple traffic classes. For CCPRs with a single class of users, the stability region is reduced to an interval. Therefore, it can be characterized by a percolation threshold. We study the potential threshold by the potential function of the base CPR used for constructing a CCPR. In addition, we prove that the CCPR is stable under a technical condition for the window size. For the multiclass scenario, we recursively evaluate the density evolution equations to determine the boundaries of the stability region. Numerical results demonstrate that the stability region of CCPRs can be enlarged compared to that of CPRs by leveraging the spatially-coupled method. Moreover, the stability region of CCPRs is close to our outer bounds when the window size is large.</description>

Abstract: Covert channel networks are a well-known method for circumventing the security measures organizations put in place to protect their networks from adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel method based on bit-rate modulation for implementing covert channels between devices connected over a wide area network. This attack can be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive information from a machine (i.e., covert sender) and stealthily transfer it to a covert receiver while evading network security measures and detection systems. We explain how to implement this threat, focusing specifically on covert channel networks and their potential security risks to network information transmission. The proposed method leverages bit-rate modulation, where a high bit rate represents a '1' and a low bit rate represents a '0', enabling covert communication. We analyze the key metrics associated with covert channels, including robustness in the presence of legitimate traffic and other interference, bit-rate capacity, and bit error rate. Experiments demonstrate the good performance of this attack, which achieved 5 bps with excellent robustness and a channel capacity of up to 0.9239 bps/Hz under different noise sources. Therefore, we show that bit-rate modulation effectively violates network security and compromises sensitive data.</description>

      <title>How to Make Money From Fresh Data: Subscription Strategies in Age-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a communication system consisting of a server that tracks and publishes updates about a time-varying data source or event, and a gossip network of users interested in closely tracking the event. The timeliness of the information is measured through the version age of information. The users wish to have their expected version ages remain below a threshold, and have the option to either rely on gossip from their neighbors or subscribe to the server directly to follow updates about the event if the former option does not meet the timeliness requirements. The server wishes to maximize its profit by increasing the number of subscribers and reducing costs associated with the frequent sampling of the event. We model the problem setup as a Stackelberg game between the server and the users, where the server commits to a frequency of sampling the event, and the users make decisions on whether to subscribe or not. As an initial work, we focus on directed networks with unidirectional flow of information and obtain the optimal equilibrium strategies for all the players. We provide simulation results to confirm the theoretical findings and provide additional insights.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication is the most secure technique of transmitting data available today. Fiber communication lines and satellite-to-ground links have served as the basis for the most successful quantum networks that have been developed so far. Using a UAV, satellite or both for free-space quantum communication reduces the need for permanent ground connections and takes advantage of the lower loss limit in space, which makes it more efficient. This work surveys the recent development in Quantum Satellites and Quantum UAVs-based networks. Here, the importance of the latest technologies, including quantum artificial intelligence, blockchain quantum machine learning, quantum satellites and quantum UAVs, are explored from network perspectives. Further, this work discussed the role of satellite-based images and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Cloudy with a Chance of Green: Measuring the Predictability of 18,009 Traffic Lights in Hamburg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Informing drivers about the predicted state of upcoming traffic lights is considered a key solution to reduce unneeded energy expenditure and dilemma zones at intersections. However, newer traffic lights can react to traffic demand, resulting in spontaneous switching behavior and poor predictability. To assess whether future traffic light assistance services are viable, it is crucial to understand how strongly predictability is affected by such spontaneous switching behavior. Previous studies have so far only reported percentages of adaptivity-capable traffic lights, but the actual switching behavior has not been measured. Addressing this research gap, we conduct a large-scale predictability evaluation based on 424 million recorded switching cycles over four weeks for 18,009 individual traffic lights in Hamburg. Two characteristics of predictability are studied: cycle discrepancy and wait time diversity. Results indicate that fewer traffic lights exhibit hard-to-predict switching behavior than suggested by previous work, considering a reported number of 90.7% adaptive traffic lights in Hamburg. Contrasting previous work, we find that not all traffic lights capable of adaptiveness may necessarily exhibit low predictability. We critically review these results and derive avenues for future research.</description>

Abstract: This study explores implementing a digital twin network (DTN) for efficient 6G wireless network management, aligning with the fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) model. The DTN architecture comprises the Physical Twin Layer, implemented using NS-3, and the Service Layer, featuring machine learning and reinforcement learning for optimizing carrier sensitivity threshold and transmit power control in wireless networks. We introduce a robust "What-if Analysis" module, utilizing conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) for synthetic data generation to mimic various network scenarios. These scenarios assess four network performance metrics: throughput, latency, packet loss, and coverage. Our findings demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed what-if analysis framework in managing complex network conditions, highlighting the importance of the scenario-maker step and the impact of twinning intervals on network performance.</description>

Abstract: Near-field propagation, particularly that enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), has emerged as a promising research topic in recent years. However, a comprehensive literature review on RIS-based near-field technologies is still lacking. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a brief overview of near-field concepts and a systematic survey of the state-of-the-art RIS-based near-field technologies. The focus is on three key aspects: the construction of ubiquitous near-field wireless propagation environments using RIS, the enabling of new near-field paradigms for 6G networks through RIS, and the challenges faced by RIS-based near-field technologies. This technical review intends to facilitate the development and innovation of RIS-based near-field technologies.</description>

Abstract: Virtual network embedding (VNE) is an essential resource allocation task in network virtualization, aiming to map virtual network requests (VNRs) onto physical infrastructure. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution to this problem. However, existing RL-based VNE methods are limited by the unidirectional action design and one-size-fits-all training strategy, resulting in restricted searchability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a FLexible And Generalizable RL framework for VNE, named FlagVNE. Specifically, we design a bidirectional action-based Markov decision process model that enables the joint selection of virtual and physical nodes, thus improving the exploration flexibility of solution space. To tackle the expansive and dynamic action space, we design a hierarchical decoder to generate adaptive action probability distributions and ensure high training efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome the generalization issue for varying VNR sizes, we propose a meta-RL-based training method with a curriculum scheduling strategy, facilitating specialized policy training for each VNR size. Finally, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of FlagVNE across multiple key metrics. Our code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/GeminiLight/flag-vne).</description>
