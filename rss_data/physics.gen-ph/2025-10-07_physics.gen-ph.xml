      <title>The width of a black hole atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes, as classical solutions of General Relativity, are expected to exhibit quantum properties near their horizons. In this paper, we examine the behavior of quantum particles near the Schwarzschild horizon by solving the Klein-Gordon equation in the quasi-classical approximation. Our analysis shows that, rather than the periodic-in-time solutions typically associated with black hole exteriors or interiors, particles near the horizon exhibit exponentially decaying (or growing) time-dependent solutions with a complex phase. This suggests that particles are unlikely to cross the Schwarzschild horizon; instead, they are either absorbed by the black hole or reflected back, forming a thin atmospheric layer around the horizon. Using geodesic equations derived from the Klein-Gordon equation, we estimate the width of this atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Signs of Possible High-Temperature Superconductivity in Graphite Intercalated with Lithium-Based Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental results indicating possible high-temperature superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds synthesized with lithium-based alloys. Temperature-dependent measurements of magnetization, trapped magnetic flux, and electrical resistance reveal transitions with critical temperatures (Tc) in the range of 240-350 K at ambient pressure, depending on intercalation metals and conditions. The highest Tc values and largest high-Tc fractions (&lt; 0.1 %) were observed in graphite samples intercalated with ternary Sr-Ca-Li alloy. Our results and analyses suggest that the observed transitions originate from local superconductivity rather than intrinsic magnetic properties of the intercalated graphite, which may be an alternative explanation. Accordingly, we propose and intend to pursue further investigations to test and confirm the nature of the observed high-Tc transitions, and to obtain larger high-Tc fractions by optimizing the intercalation materials and methods.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the new group LB1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5636</link>
      <description>arXiv:1312.5636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new local group LB1 introduced previously will be studied and reviewed in detail, depicting its unique nature that makes it a new group in fundamental physics. It will be made clear that even though most of its elements are Lorentz transformations, one unique discrete transformation not present in the Lorentz groups, is making this group into a new group because it is a reflection. In addition there will be four particular transformations onto the local light cone. It is these discrete transformations that allow for an isomorphism between the group U(1) and LB1. This result will have profound resonations in all of particle physics, general relativity, relativistic astrophysics, Riemannian geometry and group theory. These new group will be associated to a whole set of new experiments put forward.</description>

      <title>A derivation of the first generation particle masses from internal spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal spacetime geometry was recently introduced to model certain quantum phenomena using spacetime metrics that are degenerate. We use the Ricci tensors of these metrics to derive a ratio of the bare up and down quark masses, obtaining $m_u/m_d = 9604/19683 \approx .4879$. This value is within the lattice QCD value $.473 \pm .023$, obtained at $2 \operatorname{GeV}$ in the minimal subtraction scheme using supercomputers. Moreover, using the Levi-Cevita Poisson equation, we derive ratios of the dressed electron mass and bare quark masses. For a dressed electron mass of $.511 \operatorname{MeV}$, these ratios yield the bare quark masses $m_u \approx 2.2440 \operatorname{MeV}$ and $m_d \approx 4.599 \operatorname{MeV}$, which are within/near the lattice QCD values $m^{\overline{\operatorname{MS}}}_u = (2.20\pm .10) \operatorname{MeV}$ and $m^{\overline{\operatorname{MS}}}_d = (4.69 \pm .07) \operatorname{MeV}$. Finally, using $4$-accelerations, we derive the ratio $\tilde{m}_u/\tilde{m}_d = 48/49 \approx .98$ of the constituent up and down quark masses. This value is within the $.97 \sim 1$ range of constituent quark models. All of the ratios we obtain are from first principles alone, with no free or ad hoc parameters. Furthermore, and rather curiously, our derivations do not use quantum field theory, but only tools from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Taking quantisation seriously: a farewell to waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dual wave-particle nature of quantum objects is a notoriously unintuitive feature of quantum theories. However, it is often deemed essential, due to otherwise discrete particles exhibiting diffraction and interference. Troublingly, Land\'{e} and L\'{e}vy-Leblond have shown that de Broglie wavelengths are not relativistically covariant as simultaneous spatial structures, making any such wave properties physically inconsistent. In this work, we explore whether modern experiments vindicate an alternative view: that apparent waviness in diffraction and interference scenarios emerges as a consequence of quantised interactions between particles. Such a view has historically received very little attention, despite being the exact modern explanation of both the Kapitza-Dirac effect and ultrafast electron diffraction. We then study a photon orbital angular momentum realisation of the double slit to prove this explanation capable of unifying barrier and phase-grating diffraction phenomena. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum formalism demands that particle momentum is determined at the point of scattering, contravening wave accounts of quantum interference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the distinct lack of clear examples of time-travellers and proposes an explanation for their absence without assuming technical barriers to constructing time machines. Instead, it develops and then analyses a model of the consequences of time-travellers; finding that time travel is self-suppressing.</description>
