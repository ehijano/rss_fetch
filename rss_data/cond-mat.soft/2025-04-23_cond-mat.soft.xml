      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of disordered fractal spring network with active forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of active bead-spring critical percolation clusters under the action of monopolar and dipolar forces. Previously, Langevin dynamics simulations of Rouse-type dynamics were performed on a deterministic fractal -- the Sierpinski gasket -- and combined with analytical theory [Chaos {\bf 34}, 113107 (2024)]. To study disordered fractals, we use here the critical (bond) percolation infinite cluster of square and triangular lattices, where beads (occupying nodes) are connected by harmonic springs. Two types of active stochastic forces, modeled as random telegraph processes, are considered: force monopoles, acting on individual nodes in random directions, and force dipoles, where extensile or contractile forces act between pairs of nodes, forming dipole links. A dynamical steady state is reached where the network is dynamically swelled for force monopoles. The time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior at intermediate times longer than the force correlation time, whose anomalous exponent is solely controlled by the spectral dimension $(d_s)$ of the fractal network yielding MSD $\sim t^{\nu}$, with $\nu=1-\frac{d_s}{2}$, similar to the thermal system and in accord with the general analytic theory. In contrast, dipolar forces require a diverging time to reach a steady state, depending on the fraction of dipoles, and lead to network shrinkage. Within a quasi-steady-state assumption, we find a saturation behavior at the same temporal regime. Thereafter, a second ballistic-like rise is observed for networks with a low fraction of dipole forces, followed by a linear, diffusive increase. The second ballistic rise is, however, absent in networks fully occupied with force dipoles. These two behaviors are argued to result from local rotations of nodes, which are either persistent or fluctuating.</description>

      <title>Temperature switchable self-propulsion activity of liquid crystalline microdroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a switchable emulsion droplet microswimmer by utilizing a temperature-dependent transition of the droplet phase. The droplets, made from a liquid crystalline (LC) smectic phase material ($T =$ 25 $^{\circ}$C), self-propel only in their nematic and isotropic phases at elevated temperatures ($T\ge$ 33.5 $^{\circ}$C). This transition between motile and non-motile states is fully reversible - in the motile state, the droplets exhibit persistent motion and directional memory over multiple heating-cooling cycles. Further, we distinguish the state of rest from the state of motion by characterizing the chemical and hydrodynamic fields of the droplets. Next, we map the motility behaviour of the droplets across varying surfactant concentrations and temperatures, observing that swimming occurs only at sufficiently high surfactant concentrations above and temperatures above the smectic-nematic phase transition temperature $\textit{i.e.}$ $T\ge$ 33.5 $^{\circ}$C. Our work envisions the potential of LC emulsion droplets as switchable microswimmers.</description>

Abstract: On the basis of the application of the (Onsager) second-virial density functional theory to an artificial system that is so designed as to be the best promoter of a ``splay(-bend)'' nematic phase, it is argued that this ``modulated'' nematic phase cannot exist.</description>

      <title>Geometry of T1 transitions in epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flows of tissues of epithelial cells often involve T1 transitions. These neighbour exchanges are irreversible rearrangements crossing an energy barrier. Here, by an exact geometric construction, I determine this energy barrier for general, isolated T1 transitions dominated by line tensions. I show how deviations from regular cell packing reduce this energy barrier, but find that line tension fluctuations increase it on average. By another exact construction, I show how nonlinear tensions in vertex models of epithelial tissues also resist T1 transitions. My results thus form the basis for coarse-grained descriptions of cell neighbour exchanges in continuum models of epithelia.</description>

      <title>Polarity from the Bottom Up: A Computational Framework for Predicting Spontaneous Polar Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So-called polar liquid crystals possess spontaneous long-range mutual orientation of their electric dipole moments, conferring bulk polarity to fluid phases of matter. The combination of polarity and fluidity leads to complex phase behaviour, and rich new physics, yet the limited understanding around how specific molecular features generate long-range polar ordering in a fluid is a hindrance to development of new materials. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that probes the bimolecular potential energy landscape of candidate molecules, enabling us to dissect the role of directional intermolecular interactions in establishing polar order. In closely related families of materials we find conflicting preferences for (anti)parallel ordering which can be accounted for by specific interactions between molecules. Thus, our results allow us to argue that the presence (or absence) of polar order is a product of specific molecular features and strong directional intermolecular interactions rather than being simply a product of dipole-dipole forces. The design principles established can be leveraged to developing new polar liquid crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Ultradense Sphere Packings Derived From Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings are an emerging class of exotic amorphous two-phase materials endowed with novel physical properties. Such packings of identical spheres have been created from SHU point patterns via a modified collective-coordinate optimization scheme that includes a soft-core repulsion, besides the standard `stealthy' pair potential. Using the distributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find that when the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal values of $\phi$, denoted by $\phi_{\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the particle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By contrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large $\phi_{\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$ in the zero-$\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at $\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for $\phi_{\max}$ as functions of $\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our soft-core SHU packings for small $\chi$ become configurationally very close to the jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as measured by the pair statistics. As $\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the packings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting structure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that soft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range correlations in the SHU ground states. We also compute the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$, which can be used to estimate various physical properties (e.g., electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean survival time) of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for discovering novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with unprecedentedly high density.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Methodology for Reinstating the Superhydrophilicity of Ambient-Contaminant Compromised Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degradation of the hemi-wicking property of superhydrophilic high-energy surfaces due to contaminant adsorption from the ambient atmosphere is well documented. This degradation compromises the performance of such surfaces, thus affecting their efficacy in real-world applications where hemi-wicking is critical. In this work, the role of surface micro/nanostructure morphology of laser-textured metallic surfaces on superhydrophilicity degradation is studied. We explore intrinsic contact angle variations of superhydrophilic surfaces via adsorption of organics from the surroundings, which brings about the associated changes in surface chemistry. Furthermore, we explore condensation from humid air as a scalable and environment friendly methodology that can reinstate surface superhydrophilicity to a considerable extent (64% recovery of intrinsic wettability after three hours of condensation) due to the efficient removal of physisorbed contaminants from the surface texture features. The present results strengthen the argument that contact-line movement at fine scales can be used for de-pinning and removal of adsorbed organic molecules from contaminated surfaces.</description>

      <title>Mumott -- a Python package for the analysis of multi-modal tensor tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small and wide angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography are powerful methods for studying anisotropic nanostructures in a volume-resolved manner, and are becoming increasingly available to users of synchrotron facilities. The analysis of such experiments requires, however, advanced procedures and algorithms, which creates a barrier for the wider adoption of these techniques. Here, in response to this challenge, we introduce the mumott package. It is written in Python with computationally demanding tasks handled via just-in-time compilation using both CPU and GPU resources. The package is being developed with a focus on usability and extensibility, while achieving a high computational efficiency. Following a short introduction to the common workflow, we review key features, outline the underlying object-oriented framework, and demonstrate the computational performance. By developing the mumott package and making it generally available, we hope to lower the threshold for the adoption of tensor tomography and to make these techniques accessible to a larger research community.</description>

      <title>A strategy for the enhancement of barocaloric performance in plastic crystal solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The drive for solid-state heating and cooling technologies is fuelled by their potential for enhanced sustainability and environmental impact compared to traditional vapour compression devices. The recent discovery of colossal barocaloric (BC) effects in the plastic crystal (PC) neopentyl glycol (NPG) has highlighted PCs as promising candidates for future solid-state thermal management. However, achieving optimal operational temperatures, low-pressure requirements, and substantial entropy changes in a single material remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to address these constraints by forming a ternary solid solution of neopentyl PCs: NPG, pentaglycerine (PG) and pentaerythritol (PE). Notably, by including only a small quantity (2%) of the third component, we observe a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|{\Delta}Sit,rev| = 13.4 J kg-1 K-1) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ({\Delta}Tspan = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar, compared to pure NPG. The origin of these enhancements is revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. We find a reduction in the activation energies of the rotational modes associated with the main entropic component of the BC effect, linked to a weakening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond network. This is proposed to improve the phase transition reversibility and operational temperature span by facilitating a broadened first-order phase transition, characterised by a significant phase co-existence region. These findings suggest an effective strategy for practicable molecular BCs, which is to design solid solutions that exploit the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Self-organized fractal architectures driven by motility-dependent chemotactic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spatial patterns in biological systems often arise through self-organization without a central coordination, guided by local interactions and chemical signaling. In this study, we explore how motility-dependent chemical deposition and concentration-sensitive feedback can give rise to fractal-like networks, using a minimal agent-based model. Agents deposit chemicals only while moving, and their future motion is biased by local chemical gradients. This interaction generates a rich variety of self-organized structures resembling those seen in processes like early vasculogenesis and epithelial cell dispersal. We identify a diverse phase diagram governed by the rates of chemical deposition and decay, revealing transitions from uniform distributions to sparse and dense networks, and ultimately to full phase separation. At low chemical decay rates, agents form stable, system-spanning networks; further reduction leads to re-entry into a uniform state. A continuum model capturing the co-evolution of agent density and chemical fields confirms these transitions and reveals how linear stability criteria determine the observed phases. At low chemical concentrations, diffusion dominates and promotes fractal growth, while higher concentrations favor nucleation and compact clustering. These findings unify a range of biological phenomena - such as chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, and self-generated gradient navigation - within a simple, physically grounded framework. Our results also offer insights into designing artificial systems with emergent collective behavior, including robotic swarms or synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>A simple and accurate method to determine fluid-crystal phase boundaries from direct coexistence simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One method for computationally determining phase boundaries is to explicitly simulate a direct coexistence between the two phases of interest. Although this approach works very well for fluid-fluid coexistences, it is often considered to be less useful for fluid-crystal transitions, as additional care must be taken to prevent the simulation boundaries from imposing unwanted strains on the crystal phase. Here, we present a simple adaptation to the direct coexistence method that nonetheless allows us to obtain highly accurate predictions of fluid-crystal coexistence conditions, assuming a fluid-crystal interface can be readily simulated. We test our approach on hard spheres, the screened Coulomb potential, and a 2D patchy-particle model. In all cases, we find excellent agreement between the direct coexistence approach and (much more cumbersome) free-energy calculation methods. Moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to resolve the (tiny) free-energy difference between the face-centered cubic and hexagonally close-packed crystal of hard spheres in the thermodynamic limit. The simplicity of this method also ensures that it can be trivially implemented in essentially any simulation method or package. Hence, this approach provides an excellent alternative to free-energy based methods for the precise determination of phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Hindered stokesian settling of discs and rods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of the mean settling velocities for suspensions of discs and rods in the stokes regime for a number of particle aspect ratios. All these shapes display ''hindered settling'', namely, a decrease in settling speed as the solid volume fraction is increased. A comparison of our data to spheres reveals that discs and rods show less hindering than spheres at the same relative interparticle separation. The data for all six of our particle shapes may be scaled to collapse on that of spheres, with a scaling factor that depends only on the volume of the particle relative to a sphere. Despite the orientational degrees of freedom available with nonspherical particles, it thus appears that the dominant contribution to the hindered settling emerges from terms that are simply proportional to the volume of the sedimenting particles, enabling prediction of hindered settling of other nonpolar axisymmetric shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that activity and broken fore-aft shape symmetry enable microswimmers to cross streamlines in nonuniform shear, a key yet overlooked factor in active cross-stream migration. Using a model of flagellated microswimmers in microchannel flow, we find that hydrodynamic coupling and flagellar flexibility significantly impact migration. A simplified theory identifies key factors driving the underlying rich nonlinear dynamics. Our findings apply to dynamics and control of both living and artificial microswimmers, while the hydrodynamic framework extends to diverse shear flow scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Free-Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on its origins, due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of pre-critical nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been successfully compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>

Abstract: Polymeric nano- and micro-scale particles have critical roles in tackling critical healthcare and energy challenges with their miniature characteristics. However, tailoring their synthesis process to meet specific design targets has traditionally depended on domain expertise and costly trial-and-errors. Recently, modeling strategies, particularly Bayesian optimization (BO), have been proposed to aid materials discovery for maximized/minimized properties. Coming from practical demands, this study for the first time integrates constrained and composite Bayesian optimization (CCBO) to perform efficient target value optimization under black-box feasibility constraints and limited data for laboratory experimentation. Using a synthetic problem that simulates electrospraying, a model nanomanufacturing process, CCBO strategically avoided infeasible conditions and efficiently optimized particle production towards predefined size targets, surpassing standard BO pipelines and providing decisions comparable to human experts. Further laboratory experiments validated CCBO capability to guide the rational synthesis of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles with diameters of 300 nm and 3.0 $\mu$m via electrospraying. With minimal initial data and unknown experiment constraints, CCBO reached the design targets within 4 iterations. Overall, the CCBO approach presents a versatile and holistic optimization paradigm for next-generation target-driven particle synthesis empowered by artificial intelligence (AI).</description>
