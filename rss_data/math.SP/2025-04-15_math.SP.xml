      <title>Zero-energy Edge States of Tight-Binding Models for Generalized Honeycomb-Structured Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized honeycomb-structured materials have received increasing attention due to their novel topological properties.
  In this article, we investigate zero-energy edge states in tight-binding models for such materials with two different interface configurations: type-I and type-II, which are analog to zigzag and armchair interfaces for the honeycomb structure. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such edge states and rigorously prove the existence of spin-like zero-energy edge states. More specifically, type-II interfaces support two zero-energy states exclusively between topologically distinct materials. For type-I interfaces, zero-energy edge states exist between both topologically distinct and identical materials when hopping coefficients satisfy specific constraints. We further prove that the two energy curves for edge states exhibit strict crossing. We numerically simulate the dynamics of edge state wave packets along bending interfaces, which agree with the topologically protected motion of spin-like edge states in physics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Irreducibility of Nonnegative Biquadratic Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the adjacency tensor of a bipartite 2-graph is a nonnegative biquadratic tensor, it is inherently reducible. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of quasi-irreducibility in this paper. The adjacency tensor of a bipartite 2-graph is quasi-irreducible if that bipartite 2-graph is not bi-separable. This new concept reveals important spectral properties: although all M$^+$-eigenvalues are M$^{++}$-eigenvalues for irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensors, the M$^+$-eigenvalues of a quasi-irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensor can be either M$^0$-eigenvalues or M$^{++}$-eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a max-min theorem for the M-spectral radius of a nonnegative biquadratic tensor.</description>

      <title>Row completion of polynomial and rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the existence of a polynomial (rational) matrix when its eigenstructure (complete structural data) and some of its rows are prescribed. For polynomial matrices, this problem was solved in a previous work when the polynomial matrix has the same degree as the prescribed submatrix. In that paper, the following row completion problems were also solved arising when the eigenstructure was partially prescribed, keeping the restriction on the degree: the eigenstructure but the row (column) minimal indices, and the finite and/or infinite structures. Here we remove the restriction on the degree, allowing it to be greater than or equal to that of the submatrix. We also generalize the results to rational matrices. Obviously, the results obtained hold for the corresponding column completion problems.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of uniformly random permutation representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least two. Consider the composition of a uniformly random element of $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,S_n)$ with the $(n-1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_n$. We prove the strong convergence in probability as $n\to\infty$ of this sequence of random representations to the regular representation of $\Gamma$.
  As a consequence, for any closed hyperbolic surface $X$, with probability tending to one as $n\to\infty$, a uniformly random degree-$n$ covering space of $X$ has near optimal relative spectral gap -- ignoring the eigenvalues that arise from the base surface $X$.
  To do so, we show that the polynomial method of proving strong convergence can be extended beyond rational settings.
  To meet the requirements of this extension we prove two new kinds of results. First, we show there are effective polynomial approximations of expected values of traces of elements of $\Gamma$ under random homomorphisms to $S_n$. Secondly, we estimate the growth rates of probabilities that a finitely supported random walk on $\Gamma$ is a proper power after a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>A remark on the absence of eigenvalues in continuous spectra for discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operators on periodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Rellich-Vekua type theorem for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with exponentially decreasing potentials on a class of lattices including square, triangular, hexagonal lattices and their ladders. We also discuss the unique continuation theorem and the non-existence of eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Spectrally distinguishing symmetric spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The action of the subgroup $\operatorname{G}_2$ of $\operatorname{SO}(7)$ (resp.\ $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$ of $\operatorname{SO}(8)$) on the Grassmannian space $M=\frac{\operatorname{SO}(7)}{\operatorname{SO}(5)\times\operatorname{SO}(2)}$ (resp.\ $M=\frac{\operatorname{SO}(8)}{\operatorname{SO}(5)\times\operatorname{SO}(3)}$) is still transitive. We prove that the spectrum (i.e.\ the collection of eigenvalues of its Laplace-Beltrami operator) of a symmetric metric $g_0$ on $M$ coincides with the spectrum of a $\operatorname{G}_2$-invariant (resp.\ $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$-invariant) metric $g$ on $M$ only if $g_0$ and $g$ are isometric. As a consequence, each non-flat compact irreducible symmetric space of non-group type is spectrally unique among the family of all currently known homogeneous metrics on its underlying differentiable manifold.</description>

      <title>Lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on unbounded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces, and, in particular, on all convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces. In order to do this, we also obtain log-scale lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on manifolds of uniformly bounded geometry with nonpositive and negative sectional curvatures, extending the recent works of the first two authors for compact manifolds. We are able to use these along with known $L^2$-local smoothing and new $L^2 \to L^q$ half-localized resolvent estimates to obtain our lossless bounds.</description>
