      <title>Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.</description>

      <title>Computing roadmaps in unbounded smooth real algebraic sets II: algorithm and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A roadmap for an algebraic set $V$ defined by polynomials with coefficients in the field $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is an algebraic curve contained in $V$ whose intersection with all connected components of $V\cap\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is connected. These objects, introduced by Canny, can be used to answer connectivity queries over $V\cap \mathbb{R}^{n}$ provided that they are required to contain the finite set of query points $\mathcal{P}\subset V$; in this case, we say that the roadmap is associated to $(V, \mathcal{P})$.
  In this paper, we make effective a connectivity result we previously proved, to design a Monte Carlo algorithm which, on input (i) a finite sequence of polynomials defining $V$ (and satisfying some regularity assumptions) and (ii) an algebraic representation of finitely many query points $\mathcal{P}$ in $V$, computes a roadmap for $(V, \mathcal{P})$. This algorithm generalizes the nearly optimal one introduced by the last two authors by dropping a boundedness assumption on the real trace of $V$.
  The output size and running times of our algorithm are both polynomial in $(nD)^{n\log d}$, where $D$ is the maximal degree of the input equations and $d$ is the dimension of $V$. As far as we know, the best previously known algorithm dealing with such sets has an output size and running time respectively polynomial in $(n^{\log{n}}D)^{n\log n}$ and $(n^{\log{n}}D)^{n\log^2 n}$.</description>

      <title>VeriFlow: Modeling Distributions for Neural Network Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formal verification has emerged as a promising method to ensure the safety and reliability of neural networks. However, many relevant properties, such as fairness or global robustness, pertain to the entire input space. If one applies verification techniques naively, the neural network is checked even on inputs that do not occur in the real world and have no meaning. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose the VeriFlow architecture as a flow-based density model tailored to allow any verification approach to restrict its search to some data distribution of interest. We argue that our architecture is particularly well suited for this purpose because of two major properties. First, we show that the transformation that is defined by our model is piecewise affine. Therefore, the model allows the usage of verifiers based on constraint solving with linear arithmetic. Second, upper density level sets (UDL) of the data distribution are definable via linear constraints in the latent space. As a consequence, representations of UDLs specified by a given probability are effectively computable in the latent space. This property allows for effective verification with a fine-grained, probabilistically interpretable control of how a-typical the inputs subject to verification are.</description>

      <title>Additive and Multiplicative Coinvariant Spaces of Weyl Groups in the Light of Harmonics and Graded Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The action of a Weyl group on the associated weight lattice induces an additive action on the symmetric algebra and a multiplicative action on the group algebra of the lattice. We show that the coinvariant space of the multiplicative action affords the regular representation and is isomorphic to a space of multiplicative harmonics, which corresponds to existing results for additive coinvariants of reflection groups. We then design an algorithm to compute a multiplicative coinvariant basis from an additive one. The algorithm preserves isotypic decomposition and graded structure and enables the study of multiplicative coinvariants by integrating combinatorial knowledge from the additive setting. We investigate the Weyl groups of type A and C to find new explicit equivariant maps and combinatorial structure.</description>
