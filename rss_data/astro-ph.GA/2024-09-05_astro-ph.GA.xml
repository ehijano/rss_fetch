      <title>How DREAMS are made: Emulating Satellite Galaxy and Subhalo Populations with Diffusion Models and Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between galaxies and their host dark matter (DM) halos is critical to our understanding of cosmology, galaxy formation, and DM physics. To maximize the return of upcoming cosmological surveys, we need an accurate way to model this complex relationship. Many techniques have been developed to model this connection, from Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) to empirical and semi-analytic models to hydrodynamic. Hydrodynamic simulations can incorporate more detailed astrophysical processes but are computationally expensive; HODs, on the other hand, are computationally cheap but have limited accuracy. In this work, we present NeHOD, a generative framework based on variational diffusion model and Transformer, for painting galaxies/subhalos on top of DM with an accuracy of hydrodynamic simulations but at a computational cost similar to HOD. By modeling galaxies/subhalos as point clouds, instead of binning or voxelization, we can resolve small spatial scales down to the resolution of the simulations. For each halo, NeHOD predicts the positions, velocities, masses, and concentrations of its central and satellite galaxies. We train NeHOD on the TNG-Warm DM suite of the DREAMS project, which consists of 1024 high-resolution zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-mass halos with varying warm DM mass and astrophysical parameters. We show that our model captures the complex relationships between subhalo properties as a function of the simulation parameters, including the mass functions, stellar-halo mass relations, concentration-mass relations, and spatial clustering. Our method can be used for a large variety of downstream applications, from galaxy clustering to strong lensing studies.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Analytical Model for Stellar Evolution in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disks of gas accreting onto supermassive black holes may host numerous stellar-mass objects, formed within the disk or captured from a nuclear star cluster. We present a simplified model of stellar evolution applicable to these dense environments; our model exhibits exquisite agreement with full stellar evolution calculations at a minuscule fraction of the cost. Although the model presented here is limited to stars burning hydrogen in their cores, it is sufficient to determine the evolutionary fate of disk-embedded stars: whether they proceed to later stages of nuclear burning and leave behind a compact remnant, reach a quasi-steady state where mass loss and accretion balance one another, or whether accretion proceeds faster than stellar structure can adjust, causing a runaway. We provide numerous examples, highlighting how various disk parameters, and effects such as gap opening, affect stellar evolution outcomes. We also highlight how our model can accommodate time-varying conditions, such as those experienced by a star on an eccentric orbit, and can couple to N-body integrations. This model will enable more detailed studies of stellar populations and their interaction with accretion disks than have previously been possible.</description>

      <title>Central molecular zones in galaxies: 13CO(6-5) and molecular gas conditions in bright nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize all available 13CO and accompanying 12CO measurements of local galaxy centers in transitions of J=5-4 and higher, including new APEX 13CO(6-5) and 12CO(6-5) observations of 11 galaxies. The observed integrated temperature ratios of 12CO(6-5) to 12CO(1-0) range from 0.10 to 0.45. Multi-aperture data indicate that 13CO(6-5) is more centrally concentrated than 12CO(6-5). The emission of 12CO(6-5) and HCO+ but not HCN may be correlated. The new data are essential to constrain the physical properties of the galaxy center molecular gas even in a simple two-phase model approximating the more complex multi-phase structure. In all galaxies, except the Seyfert AGN galaxy NGC 1068, high J emission from the center is dominated by a dense (n = 100 000) and relatively cool (T = 20 to 60 K) high-pressure gas. In contrast, the low-J lines are dominated in most galaxies by low-pressure gas of a moderate density (n = 1000) and more elevated temperature (T = 60 to 150 K). The three exceptions with significant high-pressure gas contributions to the low J emission are all associated with active central star formation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of high-redshift galactic outflows in the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropies of the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect serve as a powerful probe of the thermal history of the universe. At high redshift, hot galactic outflows driven by supernovae (SNe) can inject a significant amount of thermal energy into the intergalactic medium, causing a strong $y$-type distortion of the CMB spectrum through inverse Compton scattering. The resulting anisotropies of the $y$-type distortion are sensitive to key physical properties of high-$z$ galaxies pertaining to the launch of energetic SNe-driven outflows, such as the efficiency and the spatio-temporal clustering of star formation. We develop a simple analytic framework to calculate anisotropies of $y$-type distortion associated with SNe-powered outflows of galaxies at $z&gt;6$. We show that galactic outflows are likely the dominant source of thermal energy injection, compared to contributions from reionized bubbles and gravitational heating. We further show that next-generation CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD can detect the contribution to $y$ anisotropies from high-$z$ galactic outflows through the cross-correlation with surveys of Lyman-break galaxies by e.g. the Roman Space Telescope. Our analysis and forecasts demonstrate that thermal SZ anisotropies are a promising probe of SNe feedback in early star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced AGN Activity in Overdense Galactic Environments at $2 &lt; z &lt; 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a study on the relationship between galaxy environments and their active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity at high redshifts ($2.0&lt;z&lt;4.0$). Specifically, we study the AGN fraction in galaxies residing in a range of environments at these redshifts, from field galaxies to highly overdense peaks in the GOODS-S extragalactic field. Utilizing the extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations in this field, we measure local- and global-overdensities over a large a range of environments, including in several massive (M$_{tot}\geq10^{14.8}$M$_\odot$) protostructures. We employ a multi-wavelength AGN catalog consisting of AGN in nine different categories. Our analysis shows a higher AGN fraction (10.9$^{+3.6}_{-2.3}$%) for galaxies in the highest local-overdensity regions compared to the AGN fraction (1.9$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$%) of coeval field galaxies (a ~4$\sigma$ difference). This trend of increasing AGN fraction in denser environments relative to the field is present in all redshift bins. We also find this trend consistently present in all five AGN categories that have a sufficient number of AGN to make a meaningful comparison: mid-IR SED, mid-IR color, X-ray luminosity, X-ray-luminosity-to-radio-luminosity-ratio, and optical-spectroscopy. Our results also demonstrate a clear trend of higher (~4x) AGN fractions in denser environments for a given stellar mass. Additionally, we observe the same trend (though at a lower significance) with the global environment of galaxies, measured using a metric based on the projected distance of galaxies from their nearest massive ($M_{tot}&gt;10^{12.8}M_\odot$) overdense ($\sigma_\delta&gt;5.0$) peak, normalized with respect to the size of the peak. These findings indicate that the prevalence of AGN activity is highly dependent on the environment in which a host galaxy resides, even at early times in the formation history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Galaxy assembly bias in the stellar-to-halo mass relation for red central galaxies from SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report evidence of galaxy assembly bias - the correlation between galaxy properties and biased secondary halo properties at fixed halo mass (M$_H$) - in the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) for red central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In the M$_H = 10^{11.5}-10^{13.5} h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ range, central galaxy stellar mass (M$_*$) is correlated with the number density of galaxies within $10 h^{-1}$ Mpc ($\delta_{10}$), a common proxy for halo formation time. This galaxy assembly bias signal is also present when M$_H$, M$_*$, and $\delta_{10}$ are substituted with group luminosity, galaxy luminosity, and metrics of the large-scale density field. To associate differences in $\delta_{10}$ with variations in halo formation time, we fitted a model that accounts for (1) errors in the M$_H$ measured by the Tinker 2021, 2022 group catalog and (2) the level of correlation between halo formation time and M$_*$ at fixed M$_H$. Fitting of this model yields that (1) errors in M$_H$ are 0.15 dex and (2) halo formation time and M$_*$ are strongly correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ~0.85). At fixed M$_H$, variations of ~0.4 dex in M$_*$ are associated with ~1-3 Gyr variations in halo formation time and in galaxy formation time (from stellar population fitting; Oyarz\'un et al. 2022). These results are indicative that halo properties other than M$_H$ can impact central galaxy assembly.</description>

      <title>The HI reservoir in central spiral galaxies and the implied star formation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cold interstellar medium (ISM) as the raw material for star formation is critical to understanding galaxy evolution. It is generally understood that galaxies stop making stars when, in one way or another, they run out of gas. However, here we provide evidence that central spiral galaxies remain rich in atomic gas even if their star formation rate and molecular gas fraction have dropped significantly compared to "normal" star-forming galaxies of the same mass. Since HI is sensitive to external processes, here we investigate central spiral galaxies using a combined sample from SDSS, ALFALFA, and xGASS surveys. After proper incompleteness corrections, we find that the key HI scaling relations for central spirals show significant but regular systematic dependence on stellar mass. At any given stellar mass, the HI gas mass fraction is about constant with changing specific star formation rate (sSFR), which suggests that HI reservoir is ubiquitous in central spirals with any star formation status down to M* ~ 10^9 Msun. Together with the tight correlation between the molecular gas mass fraction and sSFR for galaxies across a wide range of different properties, it suggests that the decline of SFR of all central spirals in the local universe is due to the halt of H2 supply, though there is plenty of HI gas around. These hence provide critical observations of the dramatically different behavior of the cold multi-phase ISM, and a key to understand the star formation process and quenching mechanism.</description>

      <title>Active Galactic Nuclei in the Green Valley at z$\sim$0.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NIR spectroscopy using MMT/MMIRS for a sample of twenty-nine massive galaxies ($\mathrm{log\ M_* / M_{\odot} \gtrsim10}$) at $\mathrm{z\sim0.7}$ with optical spectroscopy from the LEGA-C survey. Having both optical and NIR spectroscopy at this redshift allows us to measure the full suite of rest-optical strong emission lines, enabling the study of ionization sources and the rest-optical selection of active galactic nuclei (AGN), as well as the measurement of dust-corrected $\mathrm{H\alpha}$-based SFRs. We find that eleven out of twenty-nine galaxies host AGN. We infer the nonparametric star formation histories with the SED fitting code \texttt{Prospector} and classify galaxies as star-forming, green valley, or quiescent based on their most recent sSFRs. We explore the connection between AGN activity and suppressed star formation and find that $89\pm15\%$ of galaxies in the green valley or below host AGN, while only $15\%\pm8\%$ of galaxies above the green valley host AGN. We construct the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and find that the AGN host galaxies are 0.37 dex below the SFMS while galaxies without detectable AGN are consistent with being on the SFMS. However, when compared to a bootstrapped mass-matched sample, the SFRs of our sample of AGN host galaxies are consistent with the full LEGA-C sample. Based on this mass-matched analysis, we cannot rule out that this suppression of star formation is driven by other processes associated with the higher mass of the AGN sample. We therefore cannot link the presence of AGN activity to the quenching of star formation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Turbulent Equilibrium Spheres with Power-Law Linewidth-Size Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense cores inherit turbulent motions from the interstellar medium in which they form. As a tool for comparison to both simulations and observations, it is valuable to construct theoretical core models that can relate their internal density and velocity structure while predicting their stability to gravitational collapse. To this end, we solve the angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics under two assumptions: 1) the system is in a quasi-steady equilibrium; 2) the velocity field consists of radial bulk motion plus isotropic turbulence, with turbulent dispersion increasing as a power-law in the radius. The resulting turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES) solutions form a two-parameter family, characterized by the sonic radius $r_s$ and the power-law index $p$. The TES is equivalent to the Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere when $r_s\to \infty$. The density profile in outer regions of the TES is slightly shallower than the BE sphere, but is steeper than the logotropic model. Stability analysis shows that the TESs with size exceeding a certain critical radius are unstable to radial perturbations. The center-to-edge density contrast, mass, and radius of the marginally stable TES all increase with increasing average velocity dispersion. The FWHM of the column density profile is always smaller than the critical radius, by a larger factor at higher velocity dispersion, suggesting that observations need to probe beyond the FWHM to capture the full extent of turbulent cores. When applied to the highly turbulent regime typical of cluster-forming clumps, the critical mass and radius of the TES intriguingly resembles the typical mass and radius of observed star clusters.</description>

      <title>The star formation histories, star formation efficiencies and ionizing sources of ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1226 ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions were matched with radio sources in the CORNISH-North/South surveys, and 392 of them have corresponding radio sources. We determined the stellar luminosity according to the Lyman continuum flux. When the bolometric luminosity of HII-clumps is less than $\approx$ 10$^{3.7}$ L$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a clump mass $\approx$ 10$^{2.55}$ M$_{\odot}$, the stellar luminosities derived from the Lyman continuum flux overestimate the actual stellar luminosities, because the accretion onto the protostars contributes significantly to the radio emission. After subtracting the accretion luminosity, we obtained reasonable estimates of the stellar luminosity. Using the 0.5 Myr isochrone, we calculated the stellar masses according to the stellar luminosities, and found that they roughly follow the $m_{\rm max}-M_{\rm ecl}$ relation of embedded clusters, consistent with the ionizing sources representing the most massive stars in the embedded clusters of HII-clumps. We also studied the contribution of the possible flaring activity to the observed stellar luminosity and found that they can be neglected. We further studied the change of SFE with the clump mass. According to the derived mass of the most massive star in each HII-clump, using the theoretical $m_{\rm max}-M_{\rm ecl}$ relation, we calculated the mass of the corresponding embedded cluster and then the SFE of the clump. The SFE decreases with increasing clump mass, with a median value of $\approx$0.3. We also independently derived the SFE for each HII-clump based on the model developed in our previous work. The SFEs of HII-clumps derived from the observation and the model are in good agreement. Concerning the star formation histories of the ATLASGAL clumps, low-mass clumps may reach the peak of star formation earlier than high-mass clumps, consistent with the shorter free-fall time of low-mass clumps.</description>

      <title>A Potential Dynamical Origin of The Galactic Disk Warp: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus Major Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have revealed that the Galactic warp is a long-lived, nonsteady, and asymmetric structure. There is a need for a model that accounts for the warp's long-term evolution. Given that this structure has persisted for over 5 Gyrs, its timeline may coincide with the completion of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Recent studies indicate that the GSE, the significant merger of our Galaxy, was likely a gas-rich merger and the large amount of gas introduced could have created a profound impact on the Galactic morphology. This study utilizes GIZMO simulation code to construct a gas-rich GSE merger. By reconstructing the observed characteristics of the GSE, we successfully reproduce the disk warp and capture nearly all of its documented features that aligns closely with observational data from both stellar and gas disks. This simulation demonstrates the possibility that the single major merger could generate the Galactic warp amplitude and precession. Furthermore, the analysis of the warp's long-term evolution may offer more clues into the formation history of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Ageing and dynamics of the tailed radio galaxies in Abell 2142</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Tailed radio galaxies are shaped by ram pressure owing to the high-velocity motion of their host through the intracluster medium (ICM). Recent works have reported on the increasing complexity of the phenomenology of tailed galaxies, with departures from theoretical ageing models and evidence of re-energising mechanisms, which are yet unclear. Aims. The nearby (z = 0.0894) galaxy cluster Abell 2142 hosts two tailed galaxies, namely T1 and T2, which exhibit peculiar morphological features. We aim to investigate the properties of T1 and T2 and constrain their spectral evolution, dynamics, and interactions with the ICM. Methods. We combined LOw Frequency Array (LOFAR), upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), Very Large Array (VLA), and MeerKAT data (from 30 MHz to 6.5 GHz) to carry out a detailed spectral analysis of T1 and T2. We analysed surface brightness profiles, measured integrated and spatially-resolved spectral indices, and performed a comparison with single injection ageing models. Chandra X-ray data were used to search for discontinuities in the ICM properties in the direction of the targets. Results. The spectral properties of T1 at low frequencies are predicted by ageing models, and provide constraints on the 3D dynamics of the host by assuming a constant velocity. However, sharp transitions along sub-regions of the tail, local surface brightness enhancements, and a spectral shape at high frequencies that is not predicted by models suggest a more complex scenario, possibly involving hydrodynamical instabilities and particle mixing. T2 exhibits unusual morphological and surface brightness features, and its spectral behaviour is not predicted by standard models. Two AGN outburst events during the infall of T2 towards the cluster centre could explain its properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Alignment Relative to Multiple Tracers in the High-mass Star-forming Region RCW 36</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use polarization data from SOFIA HAWC+ to investigate the interplay between magnetic fields and stellar feedback in altering gas dynamics within the high-mass star-forming region RCW 36, located in Vela C. This region is of particular interest as it has a bipolar HII region powered by a massive star cluster which may be impacting the surrounding magnetic field. To determine if this is the case, we apply the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method to quantify the relative alignment between the inferred magnetic field and elongated structures observed in several datasets such as dust emission, column density, temperature, and spectral line intensity maps. The HRO results indicate a bimodal alignment trend, where structures observed with dense gas tracers show a statistically significant preference for perpendicular alignment relative to the magnetic field, while structures probed by photo-dissociation region (PDR) tracers tend to align preferentially parallel relative to the magnetic field. Moreover, the dense gas and PDR associated structures are found to be kinematically distinct such that a bimodal alignment trend is also observed as a function of line-of-sight velocity. This suggests that the magnetic field may have been dynamically important and set a preferred direction of gas flow at the time that RCW 36 formed, resulting in a dense ridge developing perpendicular to the magnetic field. However on filament-scales near the PDR region, feedback may be energetically dominating the magnetic field, warping its geometry and the associated flux-frozen gas structures, causing the observed the preference for parallel relative alignment.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Stellar Tidal Streams: Observations meet Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the well established hierarchical framework for galaxy evolution, galaxies grow through mergers with other galaxies and the LambdaCDM cosmological model predicts that the stellar halos of galaxies are rich in remnants from minor mergers. The Stellar Streams Legacy Survey has provided a first release of a catalogue with a statistically significant sample of stellar streams in the Local Universe that can be used to study minor mergers and test the cosmological models. The main objective is to compare the results of the observations of stellar tidal streams with the predictions of state-of-the-art cosmological simulations regarding the formation of stellar streams up to a redshift z &lt; 0.02, according to the LambdaCDM model. We use the predictions of the cosmological simulations Copernicus Complexio, TNG50 of the IllustrisTNG project and Auriga to generate 225 mock-images of nearby halos at a distance of 70 Mpc, and search for stellar streams. We compare the obtained stream frequency and characteristics with those obtained from the Stellar Streams Legacy Survey. We find good agreement between the results of analysing real images from the Dark Energy Survey and mock-images from cosmological simulations. We obtained predictions for the detection rate of stellar streams to a surface brightness limit of 35 mag arcsec^-2. The cosmological simulations predict that for a surface brightness limit of 32 mag arcsec^-2 a frequency of almost 70% in the detection of streams around galaxies can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Molecular clouds as hubs in spiral galaxies : gas inflow and evolutionary sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We decomposed the molecular gas in the spiral galaxy NGC 628 (M74) into multi-scale hub-filament structures using the CO (2-1) line by the dendrogram algorithm. All leaf structures as potential hubs were classified into three categories, i.e. leaf-HFs-A, leaf-HFs-B and leaf-HFs-C. leaf-HFs-A exhibit the best hub-filament morphology, which also have the highest density contrast, the largest mass and the lowest virial ratio. We employed the FILFINDER algorithm to identify and characterize filaments within 185 leaf-HFs-A structures, and fitted the velocity gradients around the intensity peaks. Measurements of velocity gradients provide evidence for gas inflow within these structures. The numbers of the associated 21 $\mu$m and H$_{\alpha}$ structures and the peak intensities of 7.7 $\mu$m, 21 $\mu$m and H$_{\alpha}$ emissions decrease from leaf-HFs-A to leaf-HFs-C. The spatial separations between the intensity peaks of CO and 21 $\mu$m structures of leaf-HFs-A are larger than those of leaf-HFs-C. These evidence indicate that leaf-HFs-A are more evolved than leaf-HFs-C. There may be an evolutionary sequence from leaf-HFs-C to leaf-HFs-A. Currently, leaf-HFs-C lack a distinct gravitational collapse process that would result in a significant density contrast. The density contrast can effectively measure the extent of the gravitational collapse and the depth of the gravitational potential of the structure which, in turn, shapes the hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic analysis presented in previous studies, a picture emerges that molecular gas in spiral galaxies is organized into network structures through the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. Molecular clouds, acting as knots within these networks, serve as hubs, which are local gravitational centers and the main sites of star formation.</description>

      <title>Orbital Support and Evolution of CX/OX Structures in Boxy/Peanut Bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barred galaxies exhibit boxy/peanut or X-shapes (BP/X) protruding from their disks in edge-on views. Two types of BP/X morphologies exist depending on whether the X-wings meet at the center (CX) or are off-centered (OX). Orbital studies indicate that various orbital types can generate X-shaped structures. Here, we provide a classification approach that identifies the specific orbit families responsible for generating OX and CX-shaped structures. Applying this approach to three different N-body bar models, we show that both OX and CX structures are associated with the x1 orbit family, but OX-supporting orbits possess higher angular momentum (closer to x1 orbits) than orbits in CX structures. Consequently, as the bar slows down the contribution of higher angular momentum OX-supporting orbits decreases and that of lower angular momentum orbits increases resulting in an evolution of the morphology from OX to CX. If the bar does not slow down, the shape of the BP/X structure and the fractions of OX/CX supporting orbits remain substantially unchanged. Bars that do not undergo buckling but that do slow down initially show the OX structure and are dominated by high angular momentum orbits, transitioning to a CX morphology. Bars that buckle exhibit a combination of both OX and CX supporting orbits immediately after the buckling, but become more CX dominated as their pattern speed decreases. This study demonstrates that the evolution of BP/X morphology and orbit populations strongly depends on the evolution of the bar angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects on Cosmic Scales as an Alternative to Dark Matter and Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-torsion theory is a gauge theory approach to gravity that expands upon Einstein's general relativity (GR) by incorporating the spin of microparticles. In this study, we further develop the spin-torsion theory to examine spherically symmetric and static gravitational systems that involve free-falling macroscopic particles. We posit that the quantum spin of macroscopic matter becomes noteworthy at cosmic scales. We further assume that the Dirac spinor and Dirac equation adequately capture all essential physical characteristics of the particles and their associated processes. A crucial aspect of our approach involves substituting the constant mass in the Dirac equation with a scale function, allowing us to establish a connection between quantum effects and the scale of gravitational systems. This mechanism ensures that the quantum effect of macroscopic matter is scale-dependent and diminishes locally, a phenomenon not observed in microparticles. For any given matter density distribution, our theory predicts an additional quantum term, the quantum potential energy (QPE), within the mass expression. The QPE induces time dilation and distance contraction, and thus mimics a gravitational well. When applied to cosmology, the QPE serves as a counterpart to the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein to balance gravity in his static cosmological model. The QPE also offers a plausible explanation for the origin of Hubble redshift (traditionally attributed to the universe's expansion). The predicted luminosity distance--redshift relation aligns remarkably well with SNe Ia data from the cosmological sample of SNe Ia. In the context of galaxies, the QPE functions as the equivalent of dark matter. The predicted circular velocities align well with rotation curve data from the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves database) sample.</description>

      <title>A Study of thin relativistic viscose accretion disk around a distorted kerr black hole (DKB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the distorted Kerr black hole (DKB) within the framework of general relativity using an axisymmetric solution of the Einstein equations. We consider the Kerr black hole in an external gravitational field up to the quadrupole moment and discuss the key aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. Our findings indicate that the presence of a quadrupole moment significantly influences the radiation emitted from the accretion disk. While the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) remains largely unchanged, the magnitude of the radiation flux, as well as the shape, orientation, and energy distribution of the accretion disk, are affected. The direction of distortion of the event horizon determines whether the disk becomes more oblate or prolate, impacting observed variations in maximum height, position, and temperature. Furthermore, the quadrupole moment alters the geometry of the black hole's spacetime, which can influence the efficiency of energy extraction from the black hole's spin. an important factor in powering emissions from accretion disks. Additionally, we investigated the effects of varying the viscosity coefficient on the behavior of the DKB. We also examined how rotation influences the dynamics of the DKB.</description>

      <title>Chasing the beginning of reionization in the JWST era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations at $z &gt; 6$ may imply galactic ionizing photon production in excess of prior expectations. Under observationally motivated assumptions about escape fractions, these suggest a $z \sim 8-9$ end to reionization, in strong tension with the $z &lt; 6$ end required by the Ly$\alpha$ forest. In this work, we use radiative transfer simulations to understand what different observations tell us about when reionization ended and when it started. We consider a model that ends too early (at $z \approx 8$) alongside two more realistic scenarios that end late at $z \approx 5$: one that starts late ($z \sim 9$) and another that starts early ($z \sim 13$). We find that the latter requires up to an order-of-magnitude evolution in galaxy ionizing properties at $6 &lt; z &lt; 12$, perhaps in tension with recent measurements of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ by JWST, which indicate little evolution. We also study how these models compare to recent measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity, mean free path, IGM thermal history, visibility of $z &gt; 8$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters, and the patchy kSZ signal from the CMB. We find that neither of the late-ending scenarios is conclusively disfavored by any single data set. However, a majority of these observables, spanning several distinct types of observations, prefer a late start. Not all probes agree with this conclusion, hinting at a possible lack of concordance between observables. Observations by multiple experiments (including JWST, Roman, and CMB-S4) in the coming years will either establish a concordance picture of reionization's early stages or reveal systematics in data and/or theoretical modeling.</description>

      <title>Resolving Twin Jets and Twin Disks with JWST and ALMA: The Young WL 20 Multiple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of jets emanating from pre-main-sequence objects exclusively at mid-infrared wavelengths, enabled by the superb sensitivity of JWST's Mid-InfraRed Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI MRS) instrument. These jets are observed only in lines of [NiII], [FeII], [ArII], and [NeII]. The H$_2$ emission, imaged in eight distinct transitions, has a completely different morphology, exhibiting a wide-angled, biconical shape, symmetrically distributed about the jet axes. Synergistic high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations resolve a pair of side-by-side edge-on accretion disks lying at the origin of the twin mid-infrared jets. Assuming coevality of the components of the young multiple system under investigation, the system age is at least (2 $-$ 2.5) $\times$ 10$^6$ yr, despite the discrepantly younger age inferred from the spectral energy distribution of the combined edge-on disk sources. The later system evolutionary stage is corroborated by ALMA observations of CO(2$-$1), $^{13}$CO(2$-1$), and C$^{18}$O(2$-$1), which show no traces of molecular outflows or remnant cavity walls. Consequently, the observed H$_2$ structures must have their origins in wide-angled disk winds, in the absence of any ambient, swept-up gas. In the context of recent studies of protostars, we propose an outflow evolutionary scenario in which the molecular gas component dominates in the youngest sources, whereas the fast, ionized jets dominate in the oldest sources, as is the case for the twin jets discovered in the WL 20 system.</description>

      <title>BASILISK II. Improved Constraints on the Galaxy-Halo Connection from Satellite Kinematics in SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Basilisk is a novel Bayesian hierarchical method for inferring the galaxy-halo connection, including its scatter, using the kinematics of satellite galaxies extracted from a redshift survey. In this paper, we introduce crucial improvements, such as updated central and satellite selection, advanced modelling of impurities and interlopers, extending the kinematic modelling to fourth order by including the kurtosis of the line-of-sight velocity distribution, and utilizing satellite abundance as additional constraint. This drastically enhances Basilisk's performance, resulting in an unbiased recovery of the full conditional luminosity function (central and satellite) and with unprecedented precision. After validating Basilisk's performance using realistic mock data, we apply it to the SDSS-DR7 data. The resulting inferences on the galaxy-halo connection are consistent with, but significantly tighter than, previous constraints from galaxy group catalogues, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing. Using full projected phase-space information, Basilisk breaks the mass-anisotropy degeneracy, thus providing precise global constraint on the average orbital velocity anisotropy of satellite galaxies across a wide range of halo masses. Satellite orbits are found to be mildly radially anisotropic, in good agreement with the mean anisotropy for subhaloes in dark matter-only simulations. Thus, we establish Basilisk as a powerful tool that is not only more constraining than other methods on similar volumes of data, but crucially, is also insensitive to halo assembly bias which plagues the commonly used techniques like galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing.</description>

      <title>Relative evolution of eclipsing binaries: A tool to measure globular cluster ages and He abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest objects in the Universe for which an age can be directly measured, thus playing an important cosmological role. This age, on the other hand, depends sensitively on the He abundance, which cannot be reliably measured from spectroscopy in GC stars. Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) near the turnoff (TO) point may play an important role in this regard. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility that, by working with differential measurements of stars that comprise a TO binary system, and assuming both stars have the same age and He abundance, one can achieve tighter, more robust, and less model-dependent constraints on the latter two quantities than otherwise possible by working with the absolute parameters of the stars. We compare both absolute and differential parameters of the stars in V69, a TO DEB pair in the GC 47 Tuc, with two different sets of stellar evolutionary tracks, making use of a Monte Carlo technique to estimate its He abundance and age, along with their uncertainties. We find that the relative approach can produce age and He abundance estimates that are in good agreement with those from the literature. We show that our estimates are also less model-dependent, less sensitive to [Fe/H], and more robust to inherent model systematics than those obtained with an absolute approach. On the other hand, the relative analysis finds larger statistical uncertainties than does its absolute counterpart, at least in the case of V69, where both stars have very similar properties. For binary pairs in which one of the components is less evolved than the other, the statistical uncertainty can be reduced. Our study suggests that the method proposed in this work may be useful to robustly constrain the He abundance and ages of GCs.</description>

      <title>Trajectory of the stellar flyby that shaped the outer solar system</title>

Abstract: Unlike the Solar System planets, thousands of smaller bodies beyond Neptune orbit the Sun on eccentric ($e &gt;$ 0.1) and ($i&gt;$ 3$^\circ$) orbits. While migration of the giant planets during the early stages of Solar System evolution can induce substantial scattering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNO), this process cannot account for the small number of distant TNOs ($r_p &gt;$ 60 au) outside the planets' reach. The alternative scenario of the close flyby of another star can instead produce all these TNO features simultaneously, but the possible parameter space for such an encounter is vast. Here, we compare observed TNO properties with thousands of flyby simulations to determine the specific properties of a flyby that reproduces all the different dynamical TNO populations, their location and their relative abundance and find that a 0.8$^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ $M_{\odot}$ star passing at a distance of $ r_p =$ 110 $\mathbf{\pm}$ 10 au, inclined by $i$ = 70$^\circ$ $^{+5}_{-10}$ gives a near-perfect match. This flyby also replicates the retrograde TNO population, which has proved difficult to explain. Such a flyby is reasonably frequent; at least 140 million solar-type stars in the Milky Way are likely to have experienced a similar one. In light of these results, we predict that the upcoming Vera Rubin telescope will reveal that distant and retrograde TNOs are relatively common.</description>

Abstract: Gaia/DR3 has provided a large sample of new g-mode pulsators, among which~11,600 are Gam Dor stars. This work present the spectroscopic parameters of these Gam Dor pulsators estimated by the GSP-spec module that analysed millions of Gaia spectra. The Galactic positions, kinematics, and orbital properties of these new Gaia pulsators were examined in order to define a sub-sample belonging to the Milky Way thin disc, in which these young stars should preferentially be found. The stellar luminosities, radii, and astrometric surface gravities were estimated without adopting any priors from uncertain stellar evolution models. These parameters, combined with the GSP-spec effective temperatures, spectroscopic gravities, and metallicities were then validated by comparison with recent literature studies. Most stars are found to belong to the Galactic thin disc, as expected. It is also found that the derived luminosities, radii, and astrometric surface gravities are of high quality and have values typical of genuine Gam Dor pulsators. Moreover, we have shown that Teff and [M/H] of pulsators with high enough SNR spectra or slow to moderate rotation rates are robust. This allowed to define a sub-sample of genuine slow-rotating Gaia Gam Dor pulsators. Their Teff are found between ~6500 and ~7800K, log(g) around 4.2 and luminosities and stellar radii peak at ~5Lsun and ~1.7Rsun. [M/H] is close to the Solar value, although 0.5dex more metal-poor and metal-rich Gam Dor are identified. The [alpha/Fe] content is fully consistent with the chemical properties of the Galactic disc. Gaia/DR3 spectroscopic properties of Gam Dor stars therefore confirm the nature of these pulsators and allow to chemo-physically parametrise a new large sample of such stars. Moreover, future Gaia DR should drastically increase the number of Gam Dor stars with good-precision spectroscopically derived parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we will cover how stars form from the stellar nurseries that are giant molecular clouds. We will first review the physical processes that compete to regulate star formation. We then review star formation in turbulent, magnetized molecular clouds and the associated statistics giving rise to the star formation rate and the initial mass function of stars. We then present the protostellar stages in detail from an observational perspective. We will primarily discuss low-mass ($&lt;1.5\msun$) stars. Finally, we examine how multiplicity complicates the single-star formation picture. This chapter will focus on star formation at redshift~0</description>

      <title>Irregular moons possibly injected from the outer solar system by a stellar flyby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The irregular moons orbit the giant planets on distant, inclined, and eccentric trajectories, in sharp contrast with the coplanar and quasicircular orbits of the regular moons. The origin of these irregular moons is still an open question, but these moons have a lot in common with the objects beyond Neptune (trans-Neptunian objects -- TNOs), suggestive of a common origin. Here, we show that the close flyby of a star may be the connecting element. A stellar flyby can simultaneously reproduce the complex TNO dynamics quantitatively while explaining the origin of the irregular moons and the colour distributions of both populations. This flyby would have catapulted 7.2% of the original TNO population into the region of the planets, many on retrograde orbits. Most injected TNOs would have been subsequently ejected from the solar system (85%). However, a considerable fraction would have had the potential to be captured by the planets. The exclusively distant origin of the injected TNOs may also explain the lack of very red irregular moons.</description>

      <title>A simple model of dust extinction in gamma-ray burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are powerful probes for studying the different properties of their host galaxies (e.g., the interstellar dust) at all redshifts. By fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) over a large range of wavelengths, we can gain direct insights into the properties of the interstellar dust by studying the extinction curves. Unlike the dust extinction templates, such as the average Milky Way (MW) or the Small and Large Magellanic Cloud (SMC and LMC), the extinction curves of galaxies outside the Local Group exhibit deviation from these laws. Altogether, X-ray and gamma-ray satellites as well as ground-based telescopes, such as Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and Gamma-Ray Optical and Near-Infrared Detector (GROND), provide measurements of the afterglows from the X-ray to the NIR, which can be used to extract information on dust extinction curves along their lines of sight. The study presented in this paper undertakes such a photometric study, comprising a preparatory work for the SVOM mission and its ground-based follow-up telescope COLIBRI. We propose a simple parameterization of the dust extinction curve of GRB host galaxies. Our model is based on a power law form with the addition of a Loretzian-like Drude profile with two parameters: the extinction slope, $\gamma$, and the 2175 $\AA$ bump amplitude, $E_\rm{b}$. Using the seven GROND filter bands, we tested our dust extinction model and explored the parameter space in extinction and redshift by fitting SEDs of simplified simulations of GRB afterglow spectra based on different extinction curve templates. From a final sample of 10 real Swift/GROND extinguished GRBs, we determined the quantities of the dust extinction in their host and measured their extinction curves. The measured average extinction curve is equivalent to a quasi-featureless in-between SMC-LMC template.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- IV. GTC/OSIRIS optical spectra of Gaia late-M and L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.</description>

Abstract: Most of a galaxy's mass is located out to hundreds of kiloparsecs beyond its stellar component. This diffuse reservoir of gas, the circumgalactic medium (CGM), acts as the interface between a galaxy and the cosmic web that connects galaxies. We present kiloparsec-scale resolution integral field spectroscopy of emission lines that trace cool ionized gas from the center of a nearby galaxy to 30 kpc into its CGM. We find a smooth surface brightness profile with a break in slope at twice the 90% stellar radius. The gas also transitions from being photoionized by HII star-forming regions in the disk to being ionized by shocks or the extragalactic UV background at larger distances. These changes represent the boundary between the interstellar medium (ISM) and the CGM, revealing how the dominant reservoir of baryonic matter directly connects to its galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Young Super Star Cluster Powering a Nebula of Retained Massive Star Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest that "Godzilla" of the lensed Sunburst galaxy ($z=2.37$) is a young super star cluster powering a nebula of gravitationally trapped stellar ejecta. Employing HST photometry and spectroscopy from VLT/MUSE and VLT/X-Shooter, we infer physical and chemical properties of the cluster and nebula, finding Godzilla is young $4$-$6$Myr, massive $2 \times 10^{6} M_\odot (1000/\mu)$, a stellar metallicity $Z \simeq 0.25 Z_\odot$, and has a compact FUV component $\lesssim 1{\rm pc}(1000/\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the flux magnification factor. The gas is significantly enriched with N and He, indicating stellar wind material, and has highly elevated O relative to the stellar metallicity, indicating entrainment of CCSNe ejecta. The high density $n_{\rm e} \simeq 10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ implies a highly pressurized intracluster environment. We propose the pressure results from CCSN-driven supersonic turbulence in warm, self-shielding gas, which has accumulated in the cluster center after runaway radiative cooling and is dense enough to resist removal by CCSNe. The nebula gas shows sub-solar C/O, Ne/O and Si/O, which may reflect the CCSN element yields for initial stellar masses $&gt;40 M_\odot$. A comparison to element yield synthesis models for young star clusters shows the gas abundances are consistent with complete retention and mixture of stellar winds and CCSNe ejecta until the inferred cluster age. The inferred O and He enhancement may have implications for the formation of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, as stars formed from this gas would contradict the observed abundances of second-population stars.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: Too much, too young, too fast? Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report ultra-deep, medium-resolution spectroscopic observations for 4 quiescent galaxies with log$_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})&gt;11$ at $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$. These data were obtained with JWST NIRSpec as part of the Early eXtragalactic Continuum and Emission Line Science (EXCELS) survey, which we introduce in this work. The first two galaxies are newly selected from PRIMER UDS imaging, both at $z=4.62$ and separated by $860$ pkpc on the sky, within a larger structure for which we confirm several other members. Both formed at $z\simeq8-10$. These systems could plausibly merge by the present day to produce a local massive elliptical galaxy. The other two ultra-massive quiescent galaxies are previously known at $z=3.99$ and $3.19$, with the latter (ZF-UDS-7329) having been the subject of debate as potentially too old and too massive to be accommodated by the $\Lambda$-CDM halo-mass function. Both exhibit high stellar metallicities, and for ZF-UDS-7329 we are able to measure the $\alpha-$enhancement, obtaining [Mg/Fe] = $0.42^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. We finally evaluate whether these 4 galaxies are consistent with the $\Lambda$-CDM halo-mass function using an extreme value statistics approach. We find that the $z=4.62$ objects and the $z=3.19$ object are unlikely within our area under the assumption of standard stellar fractions ($f_*\simeq0.1-0.2$). However, these objects roughly align with the most massive galaxies expected under the assumption of 100 per cent conversion of baryons to stars ($f_*$=1). Our results suggest extreme galaxy formation physics during the first billion years, but no conflict with $\Lambda$-CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluated the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A hide-and-seek game: Looking for Population III stars during the Epoch of Reionization through the HeII$\lambda$1640 line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gas surrounding first-generation (Pop III) stars is expected to emit a distinct signature in the form of the HeII recombination line at 1640 \r{A} (HeII$\lambda$1640). Here we explore the challenges and opportunities in identifying this elusive stellar population via the HeII$\lambda$1640 in $M_\star &gt; 10^{7.5} ~ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, $z \simeq 6 - 10$), using JWST/NIRSpec. With this aim in mind, we combine cosmological dustyGadget simulations with analytical modeling of the intrinsic HeII emission. While tentative candidates with bright HeII emission like GN-z11 have been proposed in the literature, the prevalence of such bright systems remains unclear due to significant uncertainties involved in the prediction of the HeII luminosity. In fact, similar Pop III clumps might be almost two orders of magnitude fainter, primarily depending on the assumed Pop III-formation efficiency and initial mass function in star-forming clouds, while the effect of stellar mass loss is responsible for a factor of order unity. Moreover, up to $\sim 90 \%$ of these clumps might be missed with NIRSpec/MOS due to the limited FoV, while this problem appears to be less severe with NIRSpec/IFU. We investigate the potential of deep spectroscopy targeting peripheral Pop III clumps around bright, massive galaxies to achieve a clear detection of the first stars.</description>

Abstract: Molecular clouds are regions of dense gas and dust in space where new stars and planets are born. There is a strong correlation between the distribution of dust and molecular gas in molecular clouds. The present work focuses on the three-dimensional morphological comparisons between dust and gas within 567 molecular clouds identified in previously published catalog. We confirm a sample of 112 molecular clouds, where the cloud morphology based on CO observations and dust observations displays good overall consistency. There are up to 334 molecular clouds whose dust distribution might be related to the distribution of gas. We are unable to find gas structures that correlate with the shape of the dust distribution in 24 molecular clouds. For the 112 molecular clouds where the dust distribution correlates very well with the distribution of gas, we use CO observational data to measure the physical properties of these molecular clouds and compare them with the results derived from dust, exploring the correlation between gas and dust in the molecular clouds. We found that the gas and dust in the molecular clouds have a fairly good linear relationship, with a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) of $\mathrm{GDR}=(2.80_{-0.34}^{+0.37})\times10^{21}\mathrm{\,cm^{-2}\, mag^{-1}}$. The ratio varies considerably among different molecular clouds. We measured the scale height of dust-CO clouds exhibiting strong correlations, finding $h_{Z} = 43.3_{-3.5}^{+4.0}\mathrm{\,pc}$.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on the gravitational law from $Gaia$ DR3 wide binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test Milgromian dynamics (MOND) using wide binary stars (WBs) with separations of $2-30$ kAU. Locally, the WB orbital velocity in MOND should exceed the Newtonian prediction by $\approx 20\%$ at asymptotically large separations given the Galactic external field effect (EFE). We investigate this with a detailed statistical analysis of $Gaia$ DR3 data on 8611 WBs within 250 pc of the Sun. Orbits are integrated in a rigorously calculated gravitational field that directly includes the EFE. We also allow line of sight contamination and undetected close binary companions to the stars in each WB. We interpolate between the Newtonian and Milgromian predictions using the parameter $\alpha_{\rm{grav}}$, with 0 indicating Newtonian gravity and 1 indicating MOND. Directly comparing the best Newtonian and Milgromian models reveals that Newtonian dynamics is preferred at $19\sigma$ confidence. Using a complementary Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we find that $\alpha_{\rm{grav}} = -0.021^{+0.065}_{-0.045}$, which is fully consistent with Newtonian gravity but excludes MOND at $16\sigma$ confidence. This is in line with the similar result of Pittordis and Sutherland using a somewhat different sample selection and less thoroughly explored population model. We show that although our best-fitting model does not fully reproduce the observations, an overwhelmingly strong preference for Newtonian gravity remains in a considerable range of variations to our analysis. Adapting the MOND interpolating function to explain this result would cause tension with rotation curve constraints. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of other works, concluding that MOND must be substantially modified on small scales to account for local WBs.</description>

      <title>Reionization after JWST: a photon budget crisis?</title>

Abstract: New James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations are revealing the first galaxies to be prolific producers of ionizing photons, which we argue gives rise to a tension between different probes of reionization. Over the last two decades a consensus has emerged where star-forming galaxies are able to generate enough photons to drive reionization, given reasonable values for their number densities, ionizing efficiencies $\xi_{\rm ion}$ (per unit UV luminosity), and escape fractions $f_{\rm esc}$. However, some new JWST observations infer high values of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ during reionization and an enhanced abundance of earlier ($z\gtrsim 9$) galaxies, dramatically increasing the number of ionizing photons produced at high $z$. Simultaneously, recent low-$z$ studies predict significant escape fractions for faint reionization-era galaxies. Put together, we show that the galaxies we have directly observed ($M_{\rm UV} &lt; -15$) not only can drive reionization, but would end it too early. That is, our current galaxy observations, taken at face value, imply an excess of ionizing photons and thus a process of reionization in tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Considering galaxies down to $M_{\rm UV}\approx -11$, below current observational limits, only worsens this tension. We discuss possible avenues to resolve this photon budget crisis, including systematics in either theory or observations.</description>

      <title>Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fifth forces are ubiquitous in modified gravity theories, and must be screened to evade stringent local tests. This can introduce unusual behaviour in galaxy phenomenology by affecting galaxies' components differently. Here we use the SDSS-IV-MaNGA dataset to search for a systematic excess of gas circular velocity over stellar circular velocity, expected in thin-shell-screened theories in the partially screened regime. Accounting for asymmetric drift and calibrating our model on screened subsamples, we find no significant evidence for a screened fifth force. We bound the fifth-force strength to $\Delta G/G_\text{N} &lt; 0.1$ for all astrophysical ranges, strengthening to $\sim$0.01 at Compton wavelength of 3 Mpc for the Hu-Sawicki model, for instance. This implies a stringent constraint on scalar-tensor theories, for example $f_{\mathcal{R}0} \lesssim 10^{-8}$ in Hu-Sawicki $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity.</description>
