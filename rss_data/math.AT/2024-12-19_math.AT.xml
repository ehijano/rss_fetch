      <title>The Equivariant L-Class of Pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an equivariant L-class for orientation preserving actions of a compact Lie group on a Whitney stratified compact oriented pseudomanifold that satisfies the Witt condition, for example on a compact pure-dimensional complex algebraic variety. The class lies in equivariant rational homology and its restriction to the trivial group is the Goresky-MacPherson L-class. For a smooth action on a manifold, the class is equivariantly Poincar\'e dual to the Hirzebruch L-class of the Borel homotopy quotient of the tangent bundle. We also provide a product formula under the equivariant K\"unneth isomorphism. If the group acts freely, then the equivariant L-class identifies with the Goresky-MacPherson L-class of the orbit space. The construction method rests on establishing Whitney (B)-regularity for finite-dimensional compact pseudomanifold approximations to the Borel construction, and on the author's Verdier-Riemann-Roch type formulae for the Goresky-MacPherson L-class.</description>

      <title>Graded Frobenius Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a PROP which encodes 2D-TQFTs with a grading. This defines a graded Frobenius algebra as algebras over this PROP. We also give a description of graded Frobenius algebras in terms of maps and relations. This structure naturally arises as the cohomology of manifolds, loop homology and Hochschild homology of Frobenius algebras. In addition, we give a comprehensive description of the signs that arise in suspending algebras over PROPs.</description>

      <title>Gyration Stability for Projective Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrations are operations on manifolds that arise in geometric topology, where a manifold $M$ may exhibit distinct gyrations depending on the chosen twisting. For a given $M$, we ask a natural question: do all gyrations of $M$ share the same homotopy type regardless of the twisting? A manifold with this property is said to have gyration stability. Inspired by recent work by Duan, which demonstrated that the quaternionic projective plane is not gyration stable with respect to diffeomorphism, we explore this question for projective planes in general. We obtain a complete description of gyration stability for the complex, quaternionic, and octonionic projective planes up to homotopy.</description>

      <title>A Type-Theoretic Definition of Lax $(\infty,\infty)$-Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a purely syntactic notion of lax cones and $(\infty,\infty)$-limits on finite computads in \texttt{CaTT}, a type theory for $(\infty,\infty)$-categories due to Finster and Mimram. Conveniently, finite computads are precisely the contexts in \texttt{CaTT}. We define a cone over a context to be a context, which is obtained by induction over the list of variables of the underlying context. In the case where the underlying context is globular we give an explicit description of the cone and conjecture that an analogous description continues to hold also for general contexts. We use the cone to control the types of the term constructors for the universal cone. The implementation of the universal property follows a similar line of ideas. Starting with a cone as a context, a set of context extension rules produce a context with the shape of a transfor between cones, i.e.~a higher morphism between cones. As in the case of cones, we use this context as a template to control the types of the term constructor required for universal property.</description>

      <title>Homological stratification and descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of stratification for big tensor-triangulated categories relative to the homological spectrum and develop the fundamental features of this theory. In particular, we demonstrate that it exhibits excellent descent properties. In conjunction with Balmer's Nerves of Steel conjecture, we conclude that stratification admits a general form of descent. This gives a uniform treatment of several recent stratification results and provides a complete answer to the question: When does stratification descend? As a new application, we extend earlier work on the tensor triangular geometry of equivariant module spectra from finite groups to compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Relative De Rham cohomology in diffeological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define two different versions of the relative De Rham cohomology groups of a diffeological space. Additionally, we study a variant of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence and discuss the existence of a relative cup product. Our approach is categorical, replacing open coverings with generating families and unions and intersections with pull-back and join constructions.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type of spaces of locally convex curves in the sphere S^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally convex (or nondegenerate) curves in the sphere $S^n$ have been studied for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations of order $n+1$. Taking Frenet frames allows us to obtain corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group $Spin_{n+1}$. Let $L_n(z_0;z_1)$ be the space of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed endpoints $\Gamma(0) = z_0$, $\Gamma(1) = z_1$. The aim of this paper is to determine the homotopy type of the spaces $L_3(z_0;z_1)$ for all $z_0, z_1 \in Spin_4$. As a corollary, we obtain the homotopy type of the space of closed locally convex curves in either $S^3$ or $P^3$.
  There are many previous papers addressing related questions. An early paper solves the corresponding problem for curves in $S^2$. Another previous result (with B. Shapiro) reduces the problem to $z_0 = 1$ and $z_1 \in Quat_4$ where $Quat_4 \subset Spin_4$ is a finite group of order $16$. A more recent paper shows that for $z_1 \in Quat_4 \smallsetminus Z(Quat_4)$ we have a homotopy equivalence $L_3(1;z_1) \approx \Omega Spin_4$. In this paper we compute the homotopy type of $L_3(1;z_1)$ for $z_1 \in Z(Quat_4)$: it is equivalent to the wedge of $\Omega Spin_4$ with an infinite countable family of spheres (as for the case $n = 2$).
  The structure of the proof can be compared to that of the case $n = 2$ but some of the steps require the creation of new theories, involving algebra and combinatorics. We construct explicit subsets $Y \subset L_n(z_0;z_1)$ for which the inclusion $Y \subset \Omega Spin_{n+1}(z_0;z_1)$ is a homotopy equivalence. For $n = 2$, there is a simple geometric description of $Y$; for $n = 3$, the far less natural construction is based on the theory of itineraries of such curves. The itinerary of a curve in $L_n(1;z_1)$ is a finite word in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \smallsetminus \{e\}$ of nontrivial permutations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Observables of Quantized Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization" laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of (flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian (non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the context of "Hypothesis H".</description>

      <title>Coarse cohomology of configuration space and coarse embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of equivariant coarse cohomology of the complement of a subspace in a metric space. We use this cohomology to define a notion of coarse cohomology of the configuration space of a metric space and develop tools to compute this cohomology under certain conditions. As an application of this theory, we show that certain classes in the coarse cohomology of configuration space obstruct coarse embedding between two metric spaces.</description>
