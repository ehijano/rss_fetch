      <title>Evidence for a hot galactic halo around the Andromeda Galaxy using fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients that serve as unique probes of extragalactic matter. We report on the discovery and localization of two FRBs piercing the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) by the realfast fast transient detection system at the Very Large Array. Their unique sightlines allow constraints on M31's electron density distribution. We localized FRB 20230903A to its host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.09$ and FRB 20230506C to a host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.39$. After accounting for the dispersion contribution from the Milky Way, the host galaxy and the intergalactic medium along the line of sight of the FRBs, we estimate that M31 alone will likely contribute between 21-217 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 43-338 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with a 90% confidence. We also modeled the M31 disk's contribution to the DM to determine the halo contribution. We find that the halo of M31 will contribute between 9-145 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 28-286 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with 90% confidence. The measured values of $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ are consistent with the predictions from the modified Navarro-Frenk-White profile of M31's halo for a given impact parameter. The ions of the cool halo alone cannot account for the calculated $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ and therefore this measurement presents indirect evidence of the hot halo of M31. We also suggest a possible intersection of the line of sight of FRB 20230506C with a hot baryon bridge between M31 and the Milky Way</description>

      <title>The Ejection of Transient Jets in Swift J1727.8-1613 Revealed by Time-Dependent Visibility Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High angular resolution radio observations of relativistic jets are necessary to understand the causal connection between accretion and jet ejection in low mass X-ray binaries. Images from these observations can be difficult to reconstruct due to the rapid intra-observational motion and variability of transient jets. We have developed a time-dependent visibility model fitting and self-calibration procedure and applied it to a single four-hour VLBA observation of the low-mass X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 during the bright flaring period of its 2023 outburst. This allowed us to detect and model a slightly resolved self-absorbed compact core, as well as three downstream transient jet knots. We were able to precisely measure the proper motion and flux density variability of these three jet knots, as well as (for the first time) their intra-observational expansion. Using simultaneous multi-frequency data, we were also able to measure the spectral index of the furthest downstream jet knot, and the core, as well as the frequency-dependent core shift between 2.3 and 8.3 GHz. Using these measurements, we inferred the ejection dates of the three jet knots, including one to within $\pm40$ minutes, which is one of the most precise ever measured. The ejection of the transient jet knots coincided with a bright X-ray flare and a drastic change in the X-ray spectral and timing properties as seen by HXMT, which is the clearest association ever seen between the launching of transient relativistic jets in an X-ray binary and a sudden change in the X-ray properties of the accretion inflow.</description>

      <title>A hidden quasi-periodic oscillation in Cygnus X-1 revealed by NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cygnus X-1 is a high-mass black hole binary extensively studied since its discovery in 1964. Its rapid X-ray variability provides insights into accretion physics. Unlike other black hole X-ray binaries, its power spectra are generally featureless and modeled with two broad Lorentzians, without requiring narrow quasi-periodic oscillations. We investigate the possibility that some undetected variability components in power spectra may appear in the imaginary part of the cross spectra and the coherence function. Using NICER observations up to Cycle 6, we study the power, cross, and lag spectra, along with the coherence function, searching for these "imaginary" components. We simultaneously fit the power spectra in two energy bands, 0.3-2 keV and 2-12 keV, and the real and imaginary parts of the cross-spectrum with a multi-Lorentzian model. Assuming each Lorentzian is coherent between the two bands but incoherent with others, we predict intrinsic coherence and phase lags. he intrinsic coherence shows a narrow dip at a frequency increasing from ~1 Hz to ~6 Hz as the power-law index of the Comptonized component increases from ~1.8 to ~2.4. Simultaneously, the phase lags exhibit a steep increase (the "cliff") at the same frequencies. These features vanish when using energy bands similar to RXTE (e.g., 3-5 keV and 5-12 keV). A narrow Lorentzian component with low fractional rms and large phase lag is required to reproduce the coherence drop. Its rms and phase-lag spectra evolve systematically in the hardness-intensity diagram. This "imaginary" QPO behaves like a type-C QPO despite being undetectable in power spectra alone. Similar features in MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 support this interpretation, suggesting this may be the first detection of a type-C QPO in Cygnus X-1.</description>

      <title>New insight into the hard X-ray emission influenced by the type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} bursts observed by Insight-HXMT during outburst of 4U 1636--536</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the data from Insight-HXMT and NICER, we can determine the evolution of the significance of the hard shortage in 4U 1636--536 with its spectral state, as well as the evolution of the fraction of deficit with energy. Additionally, we investigate the possible geometry and evolution of the corona in 4U 1636-536 by combining our findings with the results of spectral analysis. We find that during the soft state, the significance of possible hard X-ray shortage in bursts is almost zero. However, in the hard state, some bursts exhibit significant shortages (&gt;3 $\sigma$), while others do not. We attempt to establish a correlation between the significance of the hard X-ray shortage and the spectral parameters, but the data quality and the limited number of bursts prevent us from finding a strong correlation. For bursts with insignificant shortages in the soft state, their fraction of the deficit remains small. However, in the hard state, the fraction of deficit for all bursts increases with energy, regardless of the significance of the shortage of individual bursts. For bursts during the hard state, we investigate the evolution of the fraction of deficit during the bursts by stacking the peaks and decays of the bursts, respectively, and find that as the flux of the bursts decreases, the energy corresponding to the maximum of the fraction of deficit becomes progressively higher. We explore the possible geometry and evolution of the corona clued by the evolution of the fraction of deficit, which is obtained from the spectral and temporal analysis.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR views to the newly discovered black hole X-ray binary Swift J151857.0--572147</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic properties are largely unknown for the black hole X-ray binary Swift J151857.0--572147 newly discovered in the 2024 outburst. The nature of a black hole can be completely defined by specifying the mass and dimensionless spin parameter. Therefore, accurate measurement of the two fundamental parameters is important for understanding the nature of black holes. The joint spectral fitting of a reflection component with simultaneous observations from Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR reveals for the first time a black hole dimensionless spin of $0.84^{+0.17}_{-0.26}$ and an inclination angle of $21.1^{+4.5}_{-3.6}$ degree for this system. Monitoring of the soft state by NICER results in disk flux and temperature following $F_{\rm disk} \propto T_{\rm in}^{3.83\pm 0.17}$. For the standard thin disk, $L_{\rm disk}\approx 4\pi R_{\rm in}^{2}\sigma T_{\rm in}^{4}$, so the relationship between the flux and temperature of the disk we measured indicates that the inner radius of the disk is stable and the disk is in the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit. With an empirical relation built previously between the black hole outburst profile and the intrinsic power output, the source distance is estimated as $5.8\pm 2.5$ kpc according to the outburst profile and peak flux observed by Insight-HXMT and NICER. Finally, a black hole mass of $3.67\pm1.79-8.07\pm 4.20 M_\odot$ can be inferred from a joint diagnostic of the aforementioned parameters measured for this system. This system is also consistent with most black hole X-ray binaries with high spin and a mass in the range of 5--20 $M_\odot$</description>

      <title>The peculiar disk evolution of 4U 1630--472 observed by Insight-HXMT during the 2022 and 2023 outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary 4U 1630--472 during the 2022 and 2023 outbursts with Insight-HXMT observations. We find that the outbursts are in peculiar soft states. The effect of the hardening factor on the disk temperature is taken into account by kerrbb, and the flux and temperature of the disk are found to follow $F \propto T_{\rm eff}^{3.92\pm 0.13}$ and $F \propto T_{\rm eff}^{4.91\pm 1.00}$, for the two outbursts respectively. The flux-temperature relation is roughly consistent with holding a standard disk, By fitting with the p-free model, the p-value is found to have anti-correlation with disk temperature. Combined a joint diagnostic in a diagram of the relation between the non-thermal fraction and luminosity, by enclosing as well the previous outbursts, reveals a possible pattern for the disk evolution toward a slim one, and such an evolution may depend on the fraction of the non-thermal emission in the high soft state.</description>

      <title>Bilateral constraints on proton Lorentz violation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the early reports of events beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, the investigation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays has emerged as a fundamental method for testing Lorentz Invariance violation (LV) effects. Recent advances in observational capabilities have resulted in more stringent constraints on LV parameters. This study delves into the potentially anomalous phenomena arising from subluminal and superluminal LV effects, encompassing aspects such as proton decay and atypical threshold behavior of photo-pion production from protons within the GZK region. High-energy proton observations in cosmic rays have imposed stringent constraints on superluminal proton LV effects, while the confirmation of the GZK cutoff has established a robust boundary for the anomalous phenomena associated with subluminal proton LV effects. The research provides rigorously bilateral constraints on proton LV effects from both subluminal and superluminal standpoints.</description>

      <title>The GECAM Ground Search System for Gamma-ray Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of time-domain, multi-messenger astronomy, the detection of transient events on the high-energy electromagnetic sky has become more important than ever. The Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is a dedicated mission to monitor gamma-ray transients, launched in December, 2020. A real-time on-board trigger and location software, using the traditional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) method for blind search, is constrained to relatively bright signals due to the limitations in on-board computing resources and the need for real-time search. In this work, we developed a ground-based pipeline for GECAM to search for various transients, especially for weak bursts missed by on-board software. This pipeline includes both automatic and manual mode, offering options for blind search and targeted search. The targeted search is specifically designed to search for interesting weak bursts, such as gravitational wave-associated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). From the ground search of the data in the first year, GECAM has been triggered by 54 GRBs and other transients, including soft gamma-ray repeaters, X-ray binaries, solar flares, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. We report the properties of each type of triggers,such as trigger time and light curves. With this search pipeline and assuming a soft Band spectrum, the GRB detection sensitivity of GECAM is increased to about 1.1E-08 erg cm-2 s-1 (10 keV - 1000 keV, burst duration of 20 s). These results demonstrate that the GECAM ground search system (both blind search and targeted search) is a versatile pipeline to recover true astrophysical signals which were too weak to be found in the on-board search.</description>

      <title>The hot accretion flow evolution in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAXI J1348-630 as a low-mass black hole binary system in the Galaxy showed an X-ray outburst in 2019. We analyzed the Insight-HXMT spectral data in the low hard state (LHS) and intermediate state (IS) during the outburst from MJD 58510 to 58519 at the energy band from 2 keV to 100 keV. During the entire process, a thin disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) from a large truncated disk (truncated radius $&gt; 5$ ISCO) suggests the corona geometry evolution. There exist time lags between radio and hard X-ray flux peaks: the 30 - 100 keV flux about 5 days ahead of radio flux, 11-30 keV flux about 4 days ahead, and reflection fraction about 2 days ahead, the accretion disk approaching the ISCO about 1 day before radio peak. This disk-corona-jet coupling and evolution suggest the corona containing two phases of cold dense material and hot gas, with high temperature region of corona cooling fast. The strong radio emission accompanying with a thin accretion disk of a relatively high accretion rate favors magnetic tower jet mechanism.</description>

      <title>The relation between black hole spin, star formation rate, and black hole mass for supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both theoretical models and observational evidence indicate that jets and/or outflows driven by central active supermassive black holes exert a significant feedback effect on the overall properties of their host galaxies. Theoretical models suggest that the spin of supermassive black holes drives relativistic jets. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between black hole spin, star formation rate, and black hole mass using a sample of 48 low-redshift supermassive black holes. By performing multiband fitting of spectral energy distribution, we derive the star formation rates and stellar masses of the host galaxies harbouring these supermassive black holes. Our main results are as follows: (i) For black holes with masses \(M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_{\odot}\), the spin increases with increasing black hole mass, suggesting that black hole growth is primarily driven by gas accretion, particularly in the coherent gas accretion regime. Conversely, for black holes with masses \(M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7.5} M_{\odot}\), the spin decreases with increasing black hole mass, indicating that growth occurs mainly through mergers, inducing chaotic accretion. (ii) At low star formation rates, black hole spin increases with increasing star formation rates, consistent with gas accretion. However, at high star formation rates, black hole spin decreases with increasing star formation rates, suggesting black hole mergers. The value of the black hole spin may be used to diagnose the star formation rate of the host galaxies through active galactic nuclei activities. (iii) Our data and analysis confirm the well-known relation between stellar mass and black hole mass, with the fitting function $\log M_{\rm BH}=0.57\log M_{*}+1.94$.</description>

      <title>A Linear Decomposition Method to Analyze and Study Pulsar Mode Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03452v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the linear decomposition method (LDM), which we developed to detect and analyze pulsar profile variations and mode changing behaviour. We developed LDM utilizing the likelihood function approach assuming the Gaussian noise. The LDM projects pulse profiles onto significance-ordered orthonormal vector bases. We show that the method is similar to the principal component analysis (PCA), but LDM can handle more general situations. We use simulated dataset and data from the Kunming 40-m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of the LDM. We found that the LDM successfully identified mode changes for well-known mode-changing PSR B0329+54 and found a continuous pulse profile evolution for PSR B0355+54 . We also show that the LDM can be used to improve the timing precision for mode changing PSR B0329+54.</description>

      <title>Identifying multiplets of IceCube alert events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory publishes "alert events", i.e. detections of high-energy neutrinos with a moderate-to-high probability of being of astrophysical origin. While some events are produced in the atmosphere, a fraction of alert events should point back to their astrophysical sources. We aim to identify multiple alert events possibly related to a single astrophysical counterpart by searching for spatial and temporal clusterings in 13 years of alert data. We identify spatial clusters ("multiplets") by checking for events overlapping within their uncertainty regions. In order to reduce chance coincidences and to improve the signal purity of our sample, we apply different thresholds. We investigate the weighted mean position of these multiplets for an over-fluctuation of gamma-ray counterparts. As a final step, we apply expectation maximization to search for temporal clusters around the identified weighted mean positions. We find no statistically significant clustering of alert events around a specific origin direction or in time. This could be because the selections are still dominated by atmospheric background. Another possibility is that we are not yet sensitive enough and only detect single events from sources. In this case, we need more data in order to observe a clustering of events around their origin.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the observation-theory confrontation in high-frequency QPOs:a new QPO in NGC 5506, intermediate mass black holes, and the crucial role of accretion state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scale invariance of accretion processes (SIAP) is crucial for understanding the physical processes of black hole accretion systems at different scales. When applying this rule to high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs), there is an observation-theory confrontation in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By compiling an updated X-ray HFQPO catalog, we found that the ultraluminous X-ray sources support the HFQPO models, similar to black hole X-ray binaries. More importantly, we identified two supermassive black hole (SMBH) sources (Sgr A and NGC 1365) with possible advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) configurations that support existing HFQPO models, even though many AGNs still do not. Furthermore, we report a new HFQPO candidate in NGC 5506. This source exhibits an accretion state similar to that of Sgr A* and NGC 1365, and it also supports the HFQPO models. Our results are consistent with previous numerical simulations and suggest that the accretion state of HFQPOs in SMBHs may differ from that of stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). To reconcile the sources that do not support the models, either a global general-relativistic HFQPO model based on magnetohydrodynamics needs to be considered, or the HFQPOs in these sources may originate from entirely different physical processes. This discovery significantly extends the SIAP rule to a broader scale, confirming that the paradigm of accretion scale invariance remains consistent from SBHs to SMBHs.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos by Hydrogen-rich Supernovae interacting with low-massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hydrogen-rich (H-rich) Supernova (SN) events, the collision between the H-rich ejecta and the Circum-Stellar Medium (CSM) can accelerate particles and produce high-energy neutrinos (HE-$\nu$, TeV-PeV) through proton-proton inelastic scattering. Despite understanding the production mechanism of these neutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle acceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study focuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN 2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor and CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux at Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino emission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the spatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve of SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta, consisting of $9\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ (including $0.07\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\,\text{foe}$, collides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ distributed according to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through these parameters, we estimate that up to $4\pm1\times 10^{-2}$ muon (anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days post-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\lesssim 3\times 10^{-9}\,\text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$) is below current IceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could detect HE-$\nu$ from similar SN events.</description>

      <title>Peaky Finders: Characterizing Double-Peaked Type IIb Supernovae in Large-Scale Live-Stream Photometric Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first photometric population study of double-peaked Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). SNe IIb are produced from the core-collapse of massive stars whose outermost Hydrogen layer has been partially stripped prior to explosion. These double-peaked light curves, consisting of a shock-cooling emission peak (SCE) followed by the main nickel-powered peak, contain more crucial information about the progenitor system than the typical single-peaked light curves. We compiled and analyzed a sample of 14 spectroscopically confirmed SNe IIb -- including previously unpublished and re-classified -- with publicly available photometric observations, discovered between 2018--2022, from the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. We developed and fit a piecewise linear model, referred to as the ``lightning bolt model,'' to describe the early-time behavior of these objects to measure population statistics. Notably, we find the SCE peak lasts, on average, fewer than five days above half-maximum light with a mean rise time of $2.07\pm1.0$ and $1.1\pm0.8$ mags/day in the g- and r-band respectively. These SCE rise rates are over 10x faster than -- and last only a third the duration of -- the rise to the nickel-powered peak. These rise times are comparable to those of fast blue optical transient (FBOT) events and we discuss the implications in the text. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept alert filter, using the ANTARES broker, to demonstrate how to translate these population statistics into simple and effective filters to find potential double-peaked SNe IIb in large-scale survey alert streams, like the imminent Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin LSST).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are compact, relativistic bodies that host several extremes of modern physics. An exciting development in recent years has been the opportunity to probe this exotic physics by observing compact-binary coalescences using sensitive gravitational-wave and electromagnetic instruments. To maximise the science inferred from these measurements, we require models that accurately represent the physics. In this study, we consider the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity for the modelling of neutron-star dynamics, with a particular view to model dynamical tides at the late stages of binary inspiral. We develop the post-Newtonian perturbation equations for a non-rotating star and show that the perturbation problem is Hermitian and therefore derives from a fundamental Lagrangian. Establishing this Lagrangian system leads to a conserved symplectic product and canonical energy for the perturbations. We determine the orthogonality condition for the post-Newtonian oscillation modes, which in turn forms the foundation of a mode-sum representation often used for dynamical tides. Finally, we demonstrate that the perturbation formulation is unique.</description>

      <title>Constraints on asteroid-mass primordial black holes in dwarf galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass range remain a viable and until now unconstrained dark matter (DM) candidate. If such PBHs exist, they could be captured by stars in DM-dominated environments with low velocity dispersion such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). The capture probability increases with the stellar mass, and captured PBHs would rapidly destroy their host stars. As a result, the presence of PBHs in UFDs would alter their stellar mass functions. Using photometric observations of three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that it is unlikely that their mass functions have been significantly modified by PBHs, and we place constraints on the PBH abundance. In the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Triangulum II, PBHs around $10^{19}$g are excluded at the $2\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) level from constituting more than $\sim55\%$ ($\sim78\%$) of the dark matter, while the possibility that PBHs represent the entirety of the DM is excluded at the $3.7\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>A helical magnetic field in quasar NRAO150 revealed by Faraday rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the most luminous and extreme environments in the Universe. The central engines of AGN, believed to be super-massive black-holes, are fed by accretion discs threaded by magnetic fields within a dense magneto-ionic medium. We report our findings from polarimetric Very-long-baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar NRAO150 taken in October 2022 using a combined network of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope. These observations are the first co-temporal multi-frequency polarimetric VLBI observations of NRAO150 at frequencies above 15GHz. We use the new VLBI polarization calibration procedure, GPCAL, with polarization observations of frequencies of 12GHz, 15GHz, 24GHz, and 43GHz of NRAO150. From these observations, we measure Faraday rotation. Using our measurement of Faraday rotation, we also derive the intrinsic electric vector position angle (EVPA0) for the source. As a complementary measurement we determine the behavior of polarization as a function of observed frequency. The polarization from NRAO150 only comes from the core region, with a peak polarization intensity occurring at 24GHz. Across the core region of NRAO150 we see clear gradients in Faraday rotation and EVPA0 values that are aligned with the direction of the jet curving around the core region. We find that for the majority of the polarized region the polarization fraction is greater at higher frequencies, with intrinsic polarization fractions in the core 3%. The Faraday rotation gradients and circular patterns in EVPA0 are strong evidence for a helical/toroidal magnetic field, and the presence of low intrinsic polarization fractions indicate that the polarized emission and hence the helical/toroidal magnetic field, occur within the innermost jet.</description>

      <title>Evolution of human cognition required Einstein's gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an unexpected anthropic fine-tuning of gravity: human cognition arose on Earth only because the laws of gravity included gravitational waves. Their link is the heat from decays of the radioactive isotopes U-238 and Th-232, which were synthesized mainly in rare explosive mergers of binary neutron stars, brought about by the loss of orbital energy to gravitational radiation. This heat, released in Earth's interior, has (1) maintained plate tectonics and (2) likely helped keep Earth's iron core molten. The core's magnetic field has protected all life from annihilation by the solar wind. More surprisingly, relative brain size, a proxy for cognition, has seen two sharp increases, first for mammals and then for humans, both attributed by evolutionary biologists to adaptations to major climatic changes caused by specific tectonic events. After the second event, the joining of North and South America, human brain size grew from chimpanzee levels to modern ones. If the laws of gravity had not included gravitational waves, humans would not be capable of studying the laws of gravity.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray burst collimated fireballs: long vs short bursts by angular momentum and mass ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the gravitational collapses of rotating stellar systems accounting for Gamma-Ray Burst jet progenitors. Based on the virial theorem of hadron collisional relaxations and Newtonian slow-rotating approximation, we analyze the conversion of gravitational binding energy into kinetic energy of hadrons, whose collisions produce photons and electron-positron pairs forming fireballs. Our qualitative analysis implies that rotation effects collimate fireballs with nontrivial angular momenta along the propagating direction, thus possibly making ultra-relativistic jets. Results reveal the possible trends that the fireball becomes more collimated and the jet angle decreases as the total angular momentum and mass ratio $J/M$ of the slow-rotating collapsing core increases. Discussing the extrapolation of these trends to fast-rotating collapsing systems, we speculate that the ratio $J/M$ should be a key quantity for differentiating long bursts (massive core collapses) from short bursts (binary coalescence). We derive the intrinsic correlations of collimated fireball quantities that should be imprinted on a large sample of observed GRB data as empirical correlations.</description>

      <title>Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova (KN) detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new KNe. For this purpose, we simulate GW events assuming a data-driven, GW-motivated distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the optical light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. We use the simulated population of KNe to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of KN detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates: $\sim 1-9$ ($2-9$) yr$^{-1}$ in O4, and $13-110$ ($18-110$) yr$^{-1}$ in O5. Of these events, we expect to detect BNS (NSBH) KNe with DECam at a per year rate of: $0-2$ ($0$) in O4, and $2-28$ ($0-3$) in O5, conditional on the uncertainty on the equation of state (EOS) and volumetric rates of the mergers. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable KN to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release our GW simulations and the depths needed to detect a significant fraction of simulated KNe to enable the astronomical community to use them in their multimessenger campaigns and analyses.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Very-high-energy Diffuse Gamma-ray Emissions from the Galactic Plane with LHAASO-WCDA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission is a very important tool used to study the propagation and interaction of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. In this work, we report the measurements of the diffuse emission from the Galactic plane, covering Galactic longitudes from $15^{\circ}$ to $235^{\circ}$ and latitudes from $-5^{\circ}$ to $+5^{\circ}$, in an energy range of 1 TeV to 25 TeV, with the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). After masking the sky regions of known sources, the diffuse emission is detected with $24.6\sigma$ and $9.1\sigma$ significance in the inner Galactic plane and outer Galactic plane, respectively. The WCDA spectra in both regions can be well described by a power-law function, with spectral indices of $-2.67\pm0.05_{\rm stat}$ in the inner region and $-2.83\pm0.19_{\rm stat}$ in the outer region, respectively. Combined with the Square Kilometer Array (KM2A) measurements at higher energies, a clear softening of the spectrum is found in the inner region, with change of spectral indices by $\sim0.5$ at a break energy around $30$ TeV. The fluxes of the diffuse emission are higher by a factor of $1.5-2.7$ than the model prediction assuming local CR spectra and the gas column density, which are consistent with those measured by the KM2A. Along Galactic longitude, the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission shows deviation from that of the gas column density. The spectral shape of the diffuse emission are possibly variation in different longitude region. The WCDA measurements bridge the gap between the low-energy measurements by space detectors and the ultra-high-energy observations by LHAASO-KM2A and other experiments. These results suggest that improved modeling of the wide-band diffuse emission is required.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Population of Gamma-Ray Bursts from the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the discovery of gravitational waves (GWs), Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks have emerged as an interesting environment for hosting a fraction of their sources. AGN disks are conducive to forming both long and short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and their anticipated cosmological occurrence within these disks has potential to serve as an independent tool for probing and calibrating the population of stars and compact objects within them, and their contribution to the GW-detected population. In this study, we employ Monte Carlo methods in conjunction with models for GRB electromagnetic emission in extremely dense media to simulate the cosmological occurrence of both long and short GRBs within AGN disks, while also estimating their detectability across a range of wavelengths, from gamma-rays to radio. We investigate two extreme scenarios: ``undiffused", in which the radiation escapes without significant scattering (i.e. if the progenitor has excavated a funnel within the disk), and ``diffused", in which the radiation is propagated through the high-density medium, potentially scattered and absorbed. In the diffused case, we find that the majority of detectable GRBs, which are at most a few percent of the total, are likely to originate from lower redshifts, and from the outermost regions of large supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, $\gtrsim 10^{7.5} \rm M_{\odot}$. In the undiffused case, which has a GRB detection probability $\sim 40-50\%$, we expect a similar trend, but with a considerable contribution from the intermediate regions of lower SMBH masses. Detectable emission is generally expected to be dominant in prompt $\gamma$-rays if diffusion is not dominant, and X-ray afterglow if diffusion is important; however, the nature of the dominant observable signal highly depends on the specific AGN disk model, hence making GRBs in AGN disks also potential probes of the disk structures.</description>

      <title>TeV afterglow emission from a structured GRB jet using the kinetic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing sample of TeV emission detections in gamma-ray burst afterglows, as well as an increasing role for structured jets in afterglow modelling. Using a kinetic approach, we show that the structure of an afterglow jet impacts its TeV emission, with jets where the energy falls off more sharply with angle showing a decrease in Inverse Compton (IC) peak flux relative to synchrotron peak flux. We use a modified version of the code katu, to which we have added adiabatic expansion and a fully self-consistent treatment of IC cooling both for the electron and photon populations. We compare our results to the semi-analytical code afterglowpy, finding a good agreement with our model except at early times off axis where the effects of baryon loading are important. We compare electron cooling in the cases where there is no IC cooling, Thomson cooling and an inclusion of Klein-Nishina effects, finding that the spectra can only be distinguished if the Compton potential is significantly increased. We obtain a similar cooling rate compared to semi-analytical solutions, with some small difference at the transition from IC to synchrotron dominated cooling. Finally, we use best-fit parameters determined by afterglowpy and re-scaled for our model to reproduce the light curves of GRB 170817A. For our choice of parameters, we find that GRB 170817 would not have been detected in the TeV domain if seen on-axis, even by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Forward Shock Velocities of the Supernova Remnant N132D Based on the Thermal X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring shock velocities is crucial for understanding the energy transfer processes at the shock fronts of supernova remnants (SNRs), including acceleration of cosmic rays. Here we present shock velocity measurements on the SNR N132D, based on the thermal properties of the shock-heated interstellar medium. We apply a self-consistent model developed in our previous work to X-ray data from deep Chandra observations with an effective exposure of $\sim$ 900 ks. In our model, both temperature and ionization relaxation processes in post-shock plasmas are simultaneously calculated, so that we can trace back to the initial condition of the shock-heated plasma to constrain the shock velocity. We reveal that the shock velocity ranges from 800 to 1500 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ with moderate azimuthal dependence. Although our measurement is consistent with the velocity determined by independent proper motion measurements in the south rim regions, a large discrepancy between the two measurements (up to a factor of 4) is found in the north rim regions. This implies that a substantial amount of the kinetic energy has been transferred to the nonthermal component through highly efficient particle acceleration. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the $\gamma$-ray observations of this SNR.</description>

      <title>Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</description>

      <title>Impact of bulk viscosity on the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from merging neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the violent post-merger of binary neutron-star mergers strong oscillations are present that impact the emitted gravitational-wave (GW) signal. The frequencies, temperatures and densities involved in these oscillations allow for violations of the chemical equilibrium promoted by weak-interactions, thus leading to a nonzero bulk viscosity that can impact dynamics and GW signals. We present the first simulations of binary neutron-star mergers employing the self-consistent and second-order formulation of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for dissipative fluids proposed by M\"uller, Israel and Stewart. With the spirit of obtaining a first assessment of the impact of bulk viscosity on the structure and radiative efficiency of the merger remnant we adopt a simplified but realistic approach for the viscosity, which we assume to be determined by direct and modified Urca reactions and hence to vary within the stars. At the same time, to compensate for the lack of a precise knowledge about the strength of bulk viscosity, we explore the possible behaviours by considering three different scenarios of low, medium, and high bulk viscosity. In this way, we find that large values of the bulk viscosities damp the collision-and-bounce oscillations that characterize the dynamics of the stellar cores right after the merger. At the same time, large viscosities tend to preserve the $m=2$ deformations in the remnant, thus leading to a comparatively more efficient GW emission and to changes in the post-merger spectrum that can be up to $100\,{\rm Hz}$ in the case of the most extreme configurations. Overall, our self-consistent results indicate that bulk viscosity increases the energy radiated in GWs soon after the merger by $\lesssim 2\%$ in the (realistic) scenario of small viscosity, and by $\lesssim 30\%$ in the (unrealistic) scenario of large viscosity.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of bulk viscosity in neutron stars</title>

Abstract: The early post-merger phase of a binary neutron-star coalescence is shaped by characteristic rotational velocities as well as violent density oscillations and offers the possibility to constrain the properties of neutron star matter by observing the gravitational wave emission. One possibility to do so is the investigation of gravitational wave damping through the bulk viscosity which originates from violations of weak chemical equilibrium. Motivated by these prospects, we present a comprehensive report about the implementation of the self-consistent and second-order formulation of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics for dissipative fluids proposed by M\"uller, Israel and Stewart. Furthermore, we report on the results of two test problems, namely the viscous damping of linear density oscillations of isolated nonrotating neutron stars and the viscous migration test, both of which confirm our implementation and can be used for future code tests. Finally, we present fully general-relativistic simulations of viscous binary neutron-star mergers. We explore the structural and thermal properties of binary neutron-star mergers with a constant bulk-viscosity prescription and investigate the impact of bulk viscosity on dynamical mass ejection. We find that inverse Reynolds numbers $\sim 1\%$ can be achieved for the highest employed viscosity thereby suppressing the dynamically ejected mass by a factor of $\sim 5$ compared to the inviscid case.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unknown: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parameter Estimation (PE) for Gravitational Waves (GW) merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. This work presents a framework for accounting for uncertainties in waveform modeling. We introduce two parametrizations, relative and absolute errors in the phase of the waveform, to modify the base waveform model, which can account for uncertainties. When the waveform errors are known, those error budgets can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform error budgets. By conducting zero-noise injections and recoveries, we demonstrate through PE results that even 1-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By injecting a series of precessing waveform models and using the nonspinning model for recovery, we show that our method can account for the missing physics by making the posterior samples broad enough to account for bias. We also present a Python package that is easily integrated with the publicly available GW analysis tool PyCBC and can be used to do PE with the parametrization presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>
