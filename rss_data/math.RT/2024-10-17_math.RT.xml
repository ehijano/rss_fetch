      <title>Relative Fundamental Lemmas for Spherical Hecke Algebras and Multiplicative Hitchin Fibrations: the Jacquet--Rallis Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15155v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Jacquet--Rallis fundamental lemma for spherical Hecke algebras over local function fields using multiplicative Hitchin fibrations. Our work is inspired by the proof of [Yun11] in the Lie algebra case and builds upon the general framework of multiplicative Hitchin fibrations in [Wang24].</description>

      <title>A geometric realization of the chromatic symmetric function of a unit interval graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shareshian-Wachs, Brosnan-Chow, and Guay-Pacquet [Adv. Math.$ {\bf 295}$ (2016), ${\bf 329}$ (2018), arXiv:1601.05498] realized the chromatic (quasi-)symmetric function of a unit interval graph in terms of Hessenberg varieties. Here we exhibit another realization of these chromatic (quasi-)symmetric functions in terms of the Betti cohomology of the variety $\mathscr X_\Psi$ defined in [arXiv:2301.00862]. This yields a new inductive combinatorial expression of these chromatic symmetric functions. Based on these, we propose a geometric refinement of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture, whose validity would imply the Sharesian-Wachs conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the combinatorial model of $J$-folded alcove paths in an affine Weyl group and construct representations of affine Hecke algebras using this model. We study boundedness of these representations, and we state conjectures linking our combinatorial formulae to Kazhdan-Lusztig theory and Opdam's Plancherel Theorem.</description>

      <title>Generalized root systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of a root system by relaxing the conditions that ensure that it is invariant under reflections and study the resulting structures, which we call generalized root systems (GRSs for short). Since both Kostant root systems and root systems of Lie superalgebras are examples of GRSs, studying GRSs provides a uniform axiomatic approach to studying both of them. GRSs inherit many of the properties of root systems. In particular, every GRS defines a crystallographic hyperplane arrangement. We believe that GRSs provide an intrinsic counterpart to finite Weyl groupoids and crystallographic hyperplane arrangements, extending the relationship between finite Weyl groupoids and crystallographic hyperplane arrangements established by Cuntz. An important difference between GRSs and root systems is that GRSs may lack a (large enough) Weyl group. In order to compensate for this, we introduce the notion of a virtual reflection, building on a construction of Penkov and Serganova in the context of root systems of Lie superalgebras.
  The most significant new feature of GRSs is that, along with subsystems, one can define quotient GRSs. Both Kostant root systems and root systems of Lie superalgebras are equivalent to quotients of root systems and all root systems are isomorphic to quotients of simply-laced root systems. We classify all rank 2 GRSs and show that they are equivalent to quotients of root systems. Finally, we discuss in detail quotients of root systems. In particular we provide all isomorphisms and equivalences among them. Our results on quotient of root systems provide a different point of view on flag manifolds, reproving results of Alekseevsky and Graev.</description>

      <title>From quantum difference equation to Dubrovin connection of affine type A quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the continuation of the article \cite{Z23}. In this article we will give a detailed analysis of the quantum difference equation of the equivariant $K$-theory of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties. We will give a good representation of the quantum difference operator $\mathbf{M}_{\mathcal{L}}(z)$ such that the monodromy operator $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}(z)$in the formula can be written in the $U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-form or in the $U_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{gl}}_1)$-form. We also give the detailed analysis of the connection matrix for the quantum difference equation in the nodal limit $p\rightarrow0$. Using these two results, we prove that the degeneration limit of the quantum difference equation is the Dubrovin connection for the quantum cohomology of the affine type $A$ quiver varieties, and the monodromy representation for the Dubrovin connection is generated by the monodromy operators $\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$.</description>

      <title>Is the Wavefunction Already an Object on Space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the fact that the wavefunction is defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the $3$-dimensional space has seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\"odinger, Lorentz, and Einstein. Even today, this continues to be seen as a significant issue in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In this article, it will be shown that the wavefunction is, in fact, a genuine object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction does not possess qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in objects known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. The methodology used involves finding equivalent reinterpretations of the wavefunction exclusively in terms of objects from the geometry of space. The result is that we will find the wavefunction to be equivalent to geometric objects on space in the same way as was always the case in geometry and physics. This will be demonstrated to hold true from the perspective of Euclidean geometry, but also within Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, which naturally fits into the classification of quantum particles by the representations of spacetime isometries, as realized by Wigner and Bargmann, adding another layer of confirmation. These results lead to clarifications in the debates about the ontology of the wavefunction. From an empirical perspective, we already take for granted that all quantum experiments take place in space. I suggest that the reason why this works is that they can be interpreted naturally and consistently with the results presented here, showing that the wavefunction is an object on space.</description>

      <title>Fused K-operators and the $q$-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter, so-called K-operators, within a general framework of universal K-matrices - an extended version of the approach introduced by Appel-Vlaar. Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in "non-semisimple" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. Independently, we study K-operator solutions of the twisted intertwining relations associated with the comodule algebra ${\cal A}_q$, and expand them in the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis of ${\cal A}_q$. With a reasonably general ansatz, we found a unique solution for first few values of $j$ which agrees with the fused K-operators, as expected. We conjecture that in general such solutions are uniquely determined and match with the expressions of the fused K-operators.</description>

      <title>Shuffle algebras, lattice paths and Macdonald functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider partition functions on the $N\times N$ square lattice with the local Boltzmann weights given by the $R$-matrix of the $U_{t}(\widehat{sl}(n+1|m))$ quantum algebra. We identify boundary states such that the square lattice can be viewed on a conic surface. The partition function $Z_N$ on this lattice computes the weighted sum over all possible closed coloured lattice paths with $n+m$ different colours: $n$ ``bosonic'' colours and $m$ ``fermionic'' colours. Each bosonic (fermionic) path of colour $i$ contributes a factor of $z_i$ ($w_i$) to the weight of the configuration. We show the following. (i) $Z_N$ is a symmetric function in the spectral parameters $x_1\dots x_N$ and generates basis elements of the commutative trigonometric Feigin--Odesskii shuffle algebra. The generating function of $Z_N$ admits a shuffle-exponential formula analogous to the Macdonald Cauchy kernel. (ii) $Z_N$ is a symmetric function in two alphabets $(z_1\dots z_n)$ and $(w_1\dots w_m)$. When $x_1\dots x_N$ are set to be equal to the box content of a skew Young diagram $\mu/\nu$ with $N$ boxes the partition function $Z_N$ reproduces the skew Macdonald function $P_{\mu/\nu}\left[w-z\right]$.</description>
