      <title>The hereditariness problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the lifting problem for the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture: namely, whether the validity of the conjecture for a quotient automaton can always be transferred (or "lifted") to the original automaton. Although a complete solution remains open, we show that it is sufficient to verify the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture for three specific subclasses of reset automata: radical, simple, and quasi-simple. Our approach relies on establishing a Galois connection between the lattices of congruences and ideals of the transition monoid. This connection not only serves as the main tool in our proofs but also provides a systematic method for computing the radical ideal and for deriving structural insights about these classes. In particular, we show that for every simple or quasi-simple automaton $\mathcal{A}$, the transition monoid $\text{M}(\mathcal{A})$ possesses a unique ideal covering the minimal ideal of constant (reset) maps; a result of similar flavor holds for the class of radical automata.</description>

      <title>Stratifiable formulae are not context-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10291v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratified formulae were introduced by Quine as an alternative way to attack Russell's Paradox. Instead of limiting comprehension by size (as in $\mathsf{ZF}$ set theory, using its axiom scheme of separation), unlimited comprehension is given to formulae that are in some sense descended from formulae of typed set theory. By keeping variables in a stratified structure, the most common candidates for inconsistency such as $\{x\mid x\notin x\}$ are eliminated. Under the usual syntax of set theory, the set of stratified formulae form a formal language. We show that, unlike the full class of well-formed formulae of set theory, this language is not context-free, and extend the result to its complement. Therefore, much like the axioms of $\mathsf{PA}$ and $\mathsf{ZF}$ (under their usual axiomatizations), the theory $\mathsf{NF}$ as a formal language is not context-free. We then introduce a non-standard syntax of set theory and show that with this syntax there is a restricted class of formulae, the exo-stratified formulae, that is context-free and full (up to relabelling of variables).</description>

      <title>Intersection and Union Hierarchies of Deterministic Context-Free Languages and Pumping Lemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of finite intersections and finite unions of deterministic context-free (dcf) languages. Earlier, Wotschke [J. Comput. System Sci. 16 (1978) 456--461] demonstrated that intersections of $(d+1)$ dcf languages are in general more powerful than intersections of $d$ dcf languages for any positive integer $d$ based on the separation result of the intersection hierarchy of Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185--192]. The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke's result is not directly extendable to other non-bounded languages. To deal with a wide range of languages for the non-membership to the intersection hierarchy, we circumvent the specialization of their proof technics and devise a new and practical technical tool: two pumping lemmas for finite unions of dcf languages. Since the family of dcf languages is closed under complementation and also under intersection with regular languages, these pumping lemmas help us establish the non-membership relation of languages formed by finite intersections of target languages. We also concern ourselves with a relationship to deterministic limited automata of Hibbard [Inf. Control 11 (1967) 196--238] in this regard.</description>

      <title>Online Monitoring of Metric Temporal Logic using Sequential Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.00175v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a popular formalism to specify temporal patterns with timing constraints over the behavior of cyber-physical systems with application areas ranging in property-based testing, robotics, optimization, and learning. This paper focuses on the unified construction of sequential networks from MTL specifications over discrete and dense time behaviors to provide an efficient and scalable online monitoring framework. Our core technique, future temporal marking, utilizes interval-based symbolic representations of future discrete and dense timelines. Building upon this, we develop efficient update and output functions for sequential network nodes for timed temporal operations. Finally, we extensively test and compare our proposed technique with existing approaches and runtime verification tools. Results highlight the performance and scalability advantages of our monitoring approach and sequential networks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a novel Bayesian scaling law for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling law matches existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT or DPO to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then study ICL on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause suppressed behaviors to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with omega-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an omega-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of  Buchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>
