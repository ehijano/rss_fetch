      <title>Coming down from infinity for coordinated particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coming down from infinity for coordinated particle systems. In a coordinated particle system, particles live on a set of sites $V$ and are able to coalesce, migrate, reproduce, and die. The dynamics of these events are coordinated in that many particles may undergo the same action simultaneously. Coming down from infinity is the phenomenon where a process starting with infinitely many particles will almost surely have only finitely many particles after any positive time. This phenomenon can be observed in some $\Lambda$-coalescents, and we give necessary and sufficient conditions to observe coming down from infinity in coordinated particle systems.</description>

      <title>On the passage times of self-similar Gaussian processes on curved boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T_{c,\beta}$ denote the smallest $t\ge1$ that a continuous, self-similar Gaussian process with self-similarity index $\alpha&gt;0$ moves at least $\pm c t^\beta$ units. We prove that: (i) If $\beta&gt;\alpha$, then $T_{c,\beta}=\infty$ with positive probability; (ii) If $\beta&lt;\alpha$ then $T_{c,\beta}$ has moments of all order; and (iii) If $\beta=\alpha$ and $X$ is strongly locally nondeterministic in the sense of Pitt (1978), then there exists a continuous, strictly decreasing function $\lambda:(0\,,\infty)\to(0\,,\infty)$ such that $\mathrm{E}(T_{c,\beta}^\mu)$ is finite when $0&lt;\mu&lt;\lambda(c)$ and infinite when $\mu&gt;\lambda(c)$. Together these results extend a celebrated theorem of Breiman (1967) and Shepp (1967) for passage times of a Brownian motion on the critical square-root boundary. We briefly discuss two examples: One about fractional Brownian motion, and another about a family of linear stochastic partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weighted total variation distance between probability measures. Using Fourier-analytic tools, we present estimates in terms of Wasserstein distances between the respective probabilities, under appropriate smoothness and moment conditions. We apply our results to convergence of functionals in Malliavin calculus.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rademacher walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalisation of the one-dimensional Rademacher random walk introduced in Bhattacharya and Volkov (2023) to $\mathbb{Z}^2$ (for $d\ge 3$, the Rademacher random walk is always transient, as follows from Theorem 8.8 in Englander and Volkov (2025)). This walk is defined as the sum of a sequence of independent steps, where each step goes in one of the four possible directions with equal probability, and the size of the $n$th step is $a_n$ where $\{a_n\}$ is a given sequence of positive integers. We establish some general conditions under which the walk is recurrent, respectively, transient.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a compound Poisson random field on plane and examine its various fractional variants. We derive the distributions of these random fields and in some particular cases, obtain their associated system of governing differential equations. Additionally, various weak convergence results are derived. Also, we introduce and study some fractional variants of the Poisson random field (PRF) that includes the space fractional and the space-time fractional Poisson random fields. We discuss various distributional properties for the fractional PRFs and obtain their time-changed representations. Lastly, we define and study some fractional compound Poisson random fields using the fractional variants of PRF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the stochastic heat flow Caravenna Sun Zygouras (2023), Tsai (2024) is a black noise in the sense of Tsirelson (2004). As a corollary, the 2d stochastic heat equation driven by a mollified spacetime white noise becomes asymptotically independent of that noise in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Optimal matchings of randomly perturbed lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a point process in Euclidean space obtained by perturbing the integer lattice with independent and identically distributed random vectors. Under mild assumptions on the law of the perturbations, we construct a translation-invariant perfect matching between this point process and the lattice, such that the matching distance has the same tail behavior as the hole probability of the point process, which is a natural lower bound.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $z_1, \cdots, z_p$ be the eigenvalues of $A,$ which is the left-top $p\times p$ submatrix of an $n\times n$ Haar-invariant unitary matrix. Suppose there exist two constants $0&lt;h_1&lt;h_2&lt;1$ such that $h_1&lt;\frac pn&lt;h_2.$ Then,
  $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{P}(X_n\le x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{(\log \log n)^{2}}{2e\log n}(1+o(1))$$ and further
  $$ W_{1}\left(\mathcal{L}(X_n),\Lambda\right)=\frac{(\log\log n)^2}{2\log n}(1+o(1))$$
  for $n$ large enough. Here, $\Lambda$ is the Gumbel distribution and $\mathcal{L}(X_n)$ is the distribution of $X_n$ with $X_n$ being some rescaled version of $\max_{1\le i\le p}|z_i|,$ the spectral radius of $A.$</description>

      <title>On bivariate Archimax copulas: Level sets, mass distributions and related results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the results in n [Mai and Scherer, 2011; Trutschnig et al., 2016], which examine the way bivariate Extreme Value copulas distribute their mass, we extend these findings to the larger family of bivariate Archimax copulas $\mathcal{C}_{am}$. Working with Markov kernels (conditional distributions), we analyze the mass distributions of Archimax copulas $C \in \mathcal{C}_{am}$ and show that the support of $C$ is determined by some functions $f^0$, $g^L$ and $g^R$. Additionally, we prove that the discrete component (if any) of $C$ concentrates its mass on the graphs of certain convex functions $f^s$ or non-decreasing functions $g^t$. Investigating the level sets $L^t$ of Archimax copulas $C \in \mathcal{C}_{am}$, we establish that these sets can also be characterized in terms of the afore-mentioned functions $f^s$ and $g^t$. Furthermore, recognizing the close relationship between the level sets $L^t$ of a copula $C$ and its Kendall distribution function $F_C^K$, we provide an alternative proof for the representation of $F_C^K$ for arbitrary Archimax copulas $C\in \mathcal{C}_{am}$ and derive simple expressions for the level set masses $\mu_C(L^t)$. Building upon the fact that Archimax copulas $C \in \mathcal{C}_{am}$ can be represented via two univariate probability measures $\gamma$ and $\vartheta$ - so-called Williamson and Pickands dependence measures - we show that absolute continuity, discreteness and singularity properties of these measures $\gamma$ and $\vartheta$ carry over to the corresponding Archimax copula $C_{\gamma, \vartheta}$. Finally, we derive conditions on $\gamma$ and $\vartheta$ such that the support of the absolutely continuous, discrete or singular component of $C_{\gamma, \vartheta}$ coincides with the support of $C_{\gamma, \vartheta}$.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform bounds for non-normal approximation via Stein's method with applications to the Curie--Weiss model and the imitative monomer-dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a non-uniform Berry--Esseen bound for non-normal approximation using Stein's method. The main theorem generalizes the result of the authors in [Comptes Rendus Mathematique, 2024] to the context of non-normal approximation. As an application of the main result, we derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen bounds in non-central limit theorems for the magnetization in the Curie--Weiss model and the imitative monomer-dimer model. These extend some existing results in the literature, including Theorem 2.1 of Chatterjee and Shao [Ann. Appl. Probab., 2011] and Theorem 1 of Chen [J. Math. Physics, 2016].</description>

      <title>Nonlinear random perturbations of Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness and small-noise asymptotics of a class of stochastic partial differential equations defined on a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the diffusion coefficient depends nonlinearly and non-locally on the solution through a conditional expectation. The reaction term is assumed to be merely continuous and to satisfy a quasi-dissipativity condition, without requiring any growth bounds or local Lipschitz continuity. This setting introduces significant analytical challenges due to the temporal non-locality and the lack of regularity assumptions. Our results represent a substantial advance in the study of nonlinear stochastic perturbations of SPDEs, extending the framework developed in a previous paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a new estimate for uniform integrability under sublinear expectations. Based on this, we establish the limit theorems under nonlinear expectations dominated by sublinear expectations through tightness, and the limit distributions can be completely nonlinear. Finally, we study the limit theorem in a special case, where the limit distribution satisfies positive homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for sample autocovariance operators of Hilbert space-valued linear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers linear processes with values in a separable Hilbert space exhibiting long-range dependence. The scaling limits for the sample autocovariance operators at different time lags are investigated in the topology of their respective Hilbert spaces. Distinguishing two different regimes of long-range dependence, the limiting object is either a Hilbert space-valued Gaussian or a Hilbert space-valued non-Gaussian random variable. The latter can be represented as a unitary transformation of double Wiener-It\^o integrals with sample paths in a function space. This work is the first to show weak convergence to such double stochastic integrals with sample paths in infinite dimensions. The result generalizes the well known convergence to a Hermite process in finite dimensions, introducing a new domain of attraction for probability measures in Hilbert spaces. The key technical contributions include the introduction of double Wiener-It\^o integrals with values in a function space and with dependent integrators, as well as establishing sufficient conditions for their existence as limits of sample autocovariance operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to sample stochastic differential equations conditioned on rather general constraints, including integral constraints, endpoint constraints, and stochastic integral constraints. The algorithm is a pathspace Metropolis-adjusted manifold sampling scheme, which samples stochastic paths on the submanifold of realizations that adhere to the conditioning constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by sampling a dynamical condensation phase transition, conditioning a random walk on a fixed Levy stochastic area, conditioning a stochastic nonlinear wave equation on high amplitude waves, and sampling a stochastic partial differential equation model of turbulent pipe flow conditioned on relaminarization events.</description>

      <title>The Optimality of a Nested Generalized Pairwise Group Testing Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of identifying defective units in a finite population of \( n \) units, where each unit \( i \) is independently defective with known probability \( p_i \). This setting is referred to as the \emph{Generalized Group Testing Problem}. A testing procedure is called optimal if it minimizes the expected number of tests. It has been conjectured that, when all probabilities \( p_i \) lie within the interval \( \left[1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\, \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right] \), the \emph{generalized pairwise testing {algorithm}}, applied to the \( p_i \) arranged in nondecreasing order, constitutes the optimal nested testing strategy among all such order-preserving nested strategies. In this work, we confirm this conjecture and establish the optimality of the procedure within the specified regime. Additionally, we provide a complete structural characterization of the procedure and derive a closed-form expression for its expected number of tests. These results offer new insights into the theory of optimal nested strategies in generalized group testing.</description>

      <title>The exact region and an inequality between Chatterjee's and Spearman's rank correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rank correlation xi(X,Y), recently introduced by Chatterjee [12] and already popular in the statistics literature, takes values in [0,1], where 0 characterizes independence of X and Y, and 1 characterizes perfect dependence of Y on X. Unlike classical concordance measures such as Spearman's rho, which capture the degree of positive or negative dependence, xi quantifies the strength of functional dependence. In this paper, we determine, for each fixed value of xi, the full range of possible values of rho. The resulting xi-rho-region is a convex set whose boundary is characterized by a novel class of absolutely continuous, asymmetric copulas that are piecewise linear in the conditioning variable. Moreover, we prove that xi(X,Y) &lt;= |rho(X,Y)| whenever Y is stochastically increasing or decreasing in X, and we identify the maximal difference rho(X,Y) - xi(X,Y) as exactly 0.4. Our proofs rely on a convex optimization problem under various equality and inequality constraints, as well as on a rearrangement-based dependence order underlying xi. Our results contribute to a better understanding of Chatterjee's rank correlation which typically yields substantially smaller values than Spearman's rho when quantifying the same positive dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet $L$-functions on the Critical Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the Dirichlet $L$-functions $L(1/2+ix,\chi_q)$, where $\chi_q$ is uniformly random Dirichlet character modulo $q$, converges to a random Schwartz distribution $\zeta_{\mathrm{rand}}$, which is related to (complex) Gaussian multiplicative chaos. This is the same limiting object that appeared in [34], where the authors proved that the random shifts of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line $\zeta(1/2+ix+i\omega T)$, where $\omega\sim \mathrm{Unif} ([0,1])$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}$, converge as $T\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>On Design of Representative Distributionally Robust Formulations for Evaluation of Tail Risk Measures</title>

Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a risk measure widely used to quantify the impact of extreme losses. Owing to the lack of representative samples CVaR is sensitive to the tails of the underlying distribution. In order to combat this sensitivity, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which evaluates the worst-case CVaR measure over a set of plausible data distributions is often deployed. Unfortunately, an improper choice of the DRO formulation can lead to a severe underestimation of tail risk. This paper aims at leveraging extreme value theory to arrive at a DRO formulation which leads to representative worst-case CVaR evaluations in that the above pitfall is avoided while simultaneously, the worst case evaluation is not a gross over-estimate of the true CVaR. We demonstrate theoretically that even when there is paucity of samples in the tail of the distribution, our formulation is readily implementable from data, only requiring calibration of a single scalar parameter. We showcase that our formulation can be easily extended to provide robustness to tail risk in multivariate applications as well as in the evaluation of other commonly used risk measures. Numerical illustrations on synthetic and real-world data showcase the practical utility of our approach.</description>

      <title>On Training-Test (Mis)alignment in Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization: Observation, Empirical Exploration, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance, starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods. Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases. We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a large solution to a semilinear Dirichlet problem in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain for a non-local operator $\phi(-\Delta\vert_{D})$, an extension of the infinitesimal generator of a subordinate killed Brownian motion. The setting covers and extends the case of the spectral fractional Laplacian. The upper bound for the explosion rate of the large solution is obtained, and is given in terms of the renewal function, distance to the boundary, and the Keller-Osserman-type transformation of the semilinearity. Additionally, we prove interior higher regularity results for this operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Q^d_p$ be the random subgraph of the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube obtained after edge-percolation with probability $p$. It was shown recently by the authors that, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is some $c = c(\varepsilon)&gt;0$ such that, if $pd\ge c$, then typically $Q^d_p$ contains a cycle of length at least $(1-\varepsilon)2^d$. We strengthen this result to show that, under the same assumptions, typically $Q^d_p$ contains cycles of all even lengths between $4$ and $(1-\varepsilon)2^d$.</description>

      <title>Large Average Subtensor Problem: Ground-State, Algorithms, and Algorithmic Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the large average subtensor problem: given an order-$p$ tensor over $\mathbb{R}^{N\times \cdots \times N}$ with i.i.d. standard normal entries and a $k\in\mathbb{N}$, algorithmically find a $k\times \cdots \times k$ subtensor with a large average entry. This generalizes the large average submatrix problem, a key model closely related to biclustering and high-dimensional data analysis, to tensors. For the submatrix case, Bhamidi, Dey, and Nobel~\cite{bhamidi2017energy} explicitly highlight the regime $k=\Theta(N)$ as an intriguing open question.
  Addressing the regime $k=\Theta(N)$ for tensors, we establish that the largest average entry concentrates around an explicit value $E_{\mathrm{max}}$, provided that the tensor order $p$ is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we prove that for any $\gamma&gt;0$ and large $p$, this model exhibits multi Overlap Gap Property ($m$-OGP) above the threshold $\gamma E_{\mathrm{max}}$. The $m$-OGP serves as a rigorous barrier for a broad class of algorithms exhibiting input stability. These results hold for both $k=\Theta(N)$ and $k=o(N)$. Moreover, for small $k$, specifically $k=o(\log^{1.5}N)$, we show that a certain polynomial-time algorithm identifies a subtensor with average entry $\frac{2\sqrt{p}}{p+1}E_{\mathrm{max}}$. In particular, the $m$-OGP is asymptotically sharp: onset of the $m$-OGP and the algorithmic threshold match as $p$ grows.
  Our results show that while the case $k=\Theta(N)$ remains open for submatrices, it can be rigorously analyzed for tensors in the large $p$ regime. This is achieved by interpreting the model as a Boolean spin glass and drawing on insights from recent advances in the Ising $p$-spin glass model.</description>

Abstract: We prove normal typicality and dynamical typicality for a (centered) random block-band matrix model with block-dependent variances. A key feature of our model is that we achieve intermediate equilibration times, an aspect that has not been proven rigorously in any model before. Our proof builds on recently established concentration estimates for products of resolvents of Wigner type random matrices [arXiv:2403.10359] and an intricate analysis of the deterministic approximation.</description>

      <title>A convergence result on the lengths of Markovian loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:1210.2520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of Poisson point processes of non-trivial loops with certain intensity measures $(\mu^{(n)})_n$, where each $\mu^{(n)}$ is explicitly determined by transition probabilities $p^{(n)}$ of a random walk on a finite state space $V^{(n)}$ together with an additional killing parameter $c^{(n)}=e^{-a\cdot\sharp V^{(n)}+o(\sharp V^{(n)})}$. We are interested in asymptotic behavior of typical loops. Under general assumptions, we study the asymptotics of the length of a loop sampled from the normalized intensity measure $\bar{\mu}^{(n)}$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. A typical loop is small for $a=0$ and extremely large for $a=\infty$. For $a=(0,\infty)$, we observe both small and extremely large loops. We obtain explicit formulas for the asymptotics of the mass of intensity measures, the asymptotics of the proportion of big loops, limit results on the number of vertices (with multiplicity) visited by a loop sampled from $\bar{\mu}^{(n)}$. We verify our general assumptions for random walk loop soups on discrete tori and truncated regular trees. Finally, we consider random walk loop soups on complete graphs. Here, our general assumptions are violated. In this case, we observe different asymptotic behavior of the length of a typical loop.</description>

      <title>Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of Random Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an orthogonal expansion for real, function-regulated, second-order random measures over $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with measure covariance. Such a expansion, which can be seen as a Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition, consists in a series of deterministic real measures weighted by uncorrelated real random variables with the variances forming a convergent series. The convergence of the series is in a mean-square sense stochastically and against measurable bounded test functions (with compact support if the random measure is not finite) in the measure sense, which implies set-wise convergence. This is proven taking advantage of the extra requirement of having a covariance measure over $\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}$ describing the covariance structure of the random measure, for which we also provide a series expansion. These results cover for instance the cases of Gaussian White Noise, Poisson and Cox point processes, and can be used to obtain expansions for trawl processes.</description>

      <title>Weakly self-avoiding walk in a pareto-distributed random potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of continuous-time simple random walk paths in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ undergoing two competing interactions: an attractive one towards the large values of a random potential, and a self-repellent one in the spirit of the well-known weakly self-avoiding random walk. We take the potential to be i.i.d.~Pareto-distributed with parameter $\alpha&gt;d$, and we tune the strength of the interactions in such a way that they both contribute on the same scale as $t\to\infty$.
  Our main results are (1) the identification of the logarithmic asymptotics of the partition function of the model in terms of a random variational formula, and, (2) the identification of the path behaviour that gives the overwhelming contribution to the partition function for $\alpha&gt;2d$: the random-walk path follows an optimal trajectory that visits each of a finite number of random lattice sites for a positive random fraction of time. We prove a law of large numbers for this behaviour, i.e., that all other path behaviours give strictly less contribution to the partition function. The joint distribution of the variational problem and of the optimal path can be expressed in terms of a limiting Poisson point process arising by a rescaling of the random potential. The latter convergence is in distribution and is in the spirit of a standard extreme-value setting for a rescaling of an i.i.d. potential in large boxes, like in \cite{KLMS09}.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the Atlas model from inhomogeneous stationary profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infinite Atlas model describes the evolution of a countable collection of Brownian particles on the real line, where the lowest particle is given a drift of $\gamma \in [0,\infty)$. We study equilibrium fluctuations for the Atlas model when the system of particles starts from an inhomogeneous stationary profile with exponentially growing density. We show that the appropriately centered and scaled occupation measure of the particle positions, with suitable translations, viewed as a space-time random field, converges to a limit given by a certain stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The initial condition for this equation is given by a Brownian motion, the equation is driven by an additive space-time noise that is white in time and colored in space, and the linear operator governing the evolution is the infinitesimal generator of a geometric Brownian motion. We use this SPDE to also characterize the fluctuations of the ranked particle positions with a suitable centering and scaling. Our results describe the behavior of the particles in the bulk and one finds that the Gaussian process describing the asymptotic fluctuations has the same H\"{o}lder regularity as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $1/4$. One finds that, unlike the setting of a homogeneous profile (Dembo and Tsai (2017)), the behavior on the lower edge of the particle system is very different from the bulk behavior and in fact the variance of the Gaussian limit diverges to $\infty$ as one approaches the lower edge. Indeed, our results show that, with the gaps between particles given by one of the inhomogeneous stationary distributions, the lowest particle, started from $0$, with a linear in time translation, converges in distribution to an explicit non-Gaussian limit as $t\to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectral gap behavior of an operator obtained by summing a random permutation $M$ and a deterministic bistochastic matrix $Q$. We are interested in the asymptotic in terms of dimension. In the case where $(M,Q)$ are asymptotically free with amalgamation over the diagonal, we can compute limit operators $(u,q)$ which give the weak limit spectral distribution. Therefore we introduce free with amalgamation operators that are suitable for computing the spectral gap limit of our operator in high dimensions. We then approximate the spectral radius of the corresponding limit operator and finally give an upper bound for the spectral radius of the finite-dimensional operator. In particular, we show that if the deterministic matrix underlying graph is an expander, then the underlying graph associated to the sum with a random permutation is again an expander.</description>

Abstract: We consider multiple chordal SLEs with $\kappa\in (0,4]$. Under common time parameterization, we show that the transition density of the driving function of multiple chordal SLEs can be given by the transition density of Dyson Brownian motion and Green's function. We give two consequences of such connection: first, we show that the driving function of multiple chordal SLEs, conditional on the rare event that it survives forever, becomes Dyson Brownian motion; second, we derive the asymptotic of the probability for multiple chordal SLEs to hit a small neighborhood of a boundary point. This is a companion paper of~[FWY24].</description>

      <title>On Markov-dependent reflected autoregressive processes and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Markov-dependent reflected autoregressive processes, and other related models the analysis of which results in a vector-valued fixed-point functional equation of a certain type. In queueing terms, such processes describe the workload just before a customer arrival, which makes obsolete a fraction of the work already present, and where the interarrival time and the service time depend on a common discrete time Markov chain. Our primary aim is to derive the Laplace-Stieltjes transform vector of the steady-state workload via a recursive approach. We consider the case where given the state of the underlying Markov chain, the interarrival time and the service time are conditionally independent. Moreover, we further focus on the case where there is also additional dependence based on the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula, as well as the case where there is a dependence based on a class of multivariate matrix-exponential distributions. The transient analysis of the Markov-modulated reflected autoregressive process with a more general dependence structure is also investigated. Finally, motivated by queueing applications, we consider two other Markov-dependent models that are described by a similar stochastic recursion: the modulated shot-noise single server queue, and the single-server queue with service time randomly dependent on the waiting time.</description>

      <title>Sparse reconstruction in spin systems II: Ising and other factor of IID measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe limit fluctuations of the height function for the open TASEP on the coexistence line under the stationary measure. It is known that the height function satisfies a law of large numbers as the number of sites $n$ goes to infinity which at the coexistence line is exotic in the sense that the first-order limit is random. Here, we study the functional central limit theorem: we show that with a random centering and normalized by $\sqrt n$, the second-order limit of the height functions is a (random) mixture of two independent Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>On isomorphism of the space of continuous functions with finite $p$-th variation along a partition sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the concept of (generalized) $p$-th variation of a real-valued continuous function along a general class of refining sequence of partitions. We show that the finiteness of the $p$-th variation of a given function is closely related to the finiteness of $\ell^p$-norm of the coefficients along a Schauder basis, similar to the fact that H\"older coefficient of the function is connected to $\ell^{\infty}$-norm of the Schauder coefficients. This result provides an isomorphism between the space of $\alpha$-H\"older continuous functions with finite (generalized) $p$-th variation along a given partition sequence and a subclass of infinite-dimensional matrices equipped with an appropriate norm, in the spirit of Ciesielski.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time-dependent singular stochastic partial differential equations on the three-dimensional torus. These equations are only well-posed after one adds renormalization terms. In order to construct a well-defined notion of solution, one should put the equation in a more general setting. In this article, we consider the paradigm of paracontrolled distributions, and get concentration results around a stable deterministic equilibrium for solutions of non-autonomous generalizations of the $(\Phi_3^4)$ model. Specifically, we obtain Gaussian-type tail bounds.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the limiting behaviour of the path of random bridges treated as random sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with the Euclidean metric and the dimension $d$ increasing to infinity. The main result states that, in the square integrable case, the limit (in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense) is deterministic, namely, it is $[0,1]$ equipped with the pseudo-metric $\sqrt{|t-s|(1-|t-s|)}$. We also show that, in the heavy-tailed case with summands regularly varying of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$, the limiting metric space has a random metric derived from the bridge variant of a subordinator.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates whether two independent Elephant Random Walks (ERWs) on $\mathbb{Z}$, each with a different memory parameter, can meet infinitely often, extending the work of Roy, Takei, and Tanemura. We also study the asymptotic behavior of their distance by providing an elementary and accessible proof of the classical Law of the Iterated Logarithm (LIL) for centered, continuous, self-similar Gaussian processes under a certain decay condition on the covariance kernel.</description>

      <title>A generalized central limit theorem for critical marked Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a central limit type theorem for critical marked Hawkes process. We study the case where the marks are i.i.d. with nonnegative values and their common distribution is either heavy tailed or has finite variance. The kernel function is of a multiplicative form and the mean number of future events triggered by a single event is $1$ (criticality). We also assume that the base intensity function is heavy tailed. We prove convergence in law in the space of tempered distributions of the normalized empirical measure corresponding to the times of events. We also study convergence in law in the Skorokhod space of the normalized event counting process as the time is speeded up. In case when the distribution of marks is heavy tailed, the limit process is a stable process with dependent increments, while in case of finite variance the limit process is the same Gaussian process as for the non marked Hawkes process. We develop a new, robust method that may be applied to other self-exciting systems generalizing Hawkes processes. For example we consider a non marked self-exciting system where the number of excitations caused by single event is heavy tailed.</description>

We prove that as long as N, the number of terms in product, is sufficiently large, the largest Lyapunov exponent is asympototically Gaussian.

      <description>arXiv:2505.07638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biochemical reaction networks are widely applied across scientific disciplines to model complex dynamic systems. We investigate the diffusion approximation of reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, focusing on the identifiability of the generator of the associated stochastic differential equations. We derive conditions under which the law of the diffusion approximation is identifiable and provide theorems for verifying identifiability in practice. Notably, our results show that some reaction networks have non-identifiable reaction rates, even when the law of the corresponding stochastic process is completely known. Moreover, we show that reaction networks with distinct graphical structures can generate the same diffusion law under specific choices of reaction rates. Finally, we compare our framework with identifiability results in the deterministic ODE setting and the discrete continuous-time Markov chain models for reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for scaled families of Schr\"odinger bridges with reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show a large deviation principle for certain sequences of static Schr\"{o}dinger bridges, typically motivated by a scale-parameter decreasing towards zero, extending existing large deviation results to cover a wider range of reference processes. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for studying convergence of such Schr\"{o}dinger bridges to their limiting optimal transport plans. Within generative modeling, Schr\"{o}dinger bridges, or entropic optimal transport problems, constitute a prominent class of methods, in part because of their computational feasibility in high-dimensional settings. Recently, Bernton et al. established a large deviation principle, in the small-noise limit, for fixed-cost entropic optimal transport problems. In this paper, we address an open problem posed by Bernton et al. and extend their results to hold for Schr\"{o}dinger bridges associated with certain sequences of more general reference measures with enough regularity in a similar small-noise limit. These can be viewed as sequences of entropic optimal transport plans with non-fixed cost functions. Using a detailed analysis of the associated Skorokhod maps and transition densities, we show that the new large deviation results cover Schr\"{o}dinger bridges where the reference process is a reflected diffusion on bounded convex domains, corresponding to recently introduced model choices in the generative modeling literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a game with two players, consisting of a number of rounds, where the first player to win $n$ rounds becomes the overall winner. Who wins each individual round is governed by a certain urn having two types of balls (type 1 and type 2). At each round, we randomly pick a ball from the urn, and its type determines which of the two players wins. We study the game under three regimes. In the first and the third regimes, a ball is taken without replacement, whilst in the second regime, it is returned to the urn with one more ball of the same colour. We study the properties of the random variables equal to the properly defined overall net profits of the players, and the results are drastically different in all three regimes.</description>

      <title>A BSDE approach to the asymmetric risk-sensitive optimization and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09430v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to proposing a new asymmetric risk-sensitive criterion involving different risk attitudes toward varying risk sources. The criterion can only be defined through the initial value of the minimal solutions of quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). Before uncovering the mean-variance representation for the introduced criterion by the variational approach, some axioms are given for the first time to characterize a variance decomposition of square integrable random variables. The stochastic control problems under this criterion are described as a kind of stochastic recursive control problems that includes controlled quadratic BSDEs. An asymmetric risk-sensitive global stochastic maximum principle is derived when the quadratic BSDEs are equipped with bounded data. A closed-form solution of a stochastic linear-quadratic risk-sensitive control problem is obtained by introducing a novel completion-of-squares technique for controlled quadratic BSDEs. In addition, a dynamic portfolio optimization problem featuring a stochastic return rate is provided as an application of the asymmetric risk-sensitive control.</description>

      <title>New global Carleman estimates and null controllability for forward/backward semi-linear parabolic SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for parabolic SPDEs involving both the state and the gradient of the state. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with general random coefficients and square-integrable source terms is derived. Based on this, we further develop a new global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with source terms in the Sobolev space of negative order, which enables us to deal with the global null controllability for linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs with gradient terms. As a byproduct, a special weighted energy-type estimate for the controlled system that explicitly depends on the parameters $\lambda,\mu$ and the weighted function $\theta$ is obtained, which makes it possible to extend the linear null controllability to semi-linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs by applying the fixed-point argument in an appropriate Banach space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A path in a graph $G$ is called non-self-touching if two vertices are neighbours in the path if and only if they are neighbours in the graph. We investigate the existence of doubly infinite non-self-touching paths in infinite plane graphs.
  The matching graph $G_*$ of an infinite plane graph $G$ is obtained by adding all diagonals to all faces, and it plays an important role in the theory of site percolation on $G$. The main result of this paper is a necessary and sufficient condition on $G$ for the existence of a doubly infinite non-self-touching path in $G_*$ that traverses some diagonal. This is a key step in proving, for quasi-transitive $G$, that the critical points of site percolation on $G$ and $G_*$ satisfy the strict inequality $p_c(G_*) &lt; p_c(G)$, and it complements the earlier result of Grimmett and Li (Random Struct. Alg. 65 (2024) 832--856), proved by different methods, concerning the case of transitive graphs. Furthermore it implies, for quasi-transitive graphs, that $p_u(G) + p_c(G) \ge 1$, with equality if and only if the graph $G_\Delta$, obtained from $G$ by emptying all separating triangles, is a triangulation. Here, $p_u$ is the critical probability for the existence of a unique infinite open cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper follows on from our previous work, where we introduced the notion of \emph{confined extensions}, and our purpose is to widen the context in which such extensions appear. We do so in the setup of Poisson suspensions: we take a $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving dynamical system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$, then we consider the corresponding Poisson extension $((X \times G)^*, (\mu \otimes m_G)^*, (T_\phi)_*) \overset{}{\to} (X^*, \mu^*, T_*)$. Our results give two different conditions under which that extension is confined. Finally, to show that those conditions are not void, we give an example of a system $(X, \mu, T)$ and a cocycle $\phi$ so that the compact extension $(X \times G, \mu \otimes m_G, T_\phi)$ has an infinite ergodic index.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 2-player zero-sum concurrent (i.e., simultaneous move) stochastic B\"uchi games and Transience games on countable graphs. Two players, Max and Min, seek respectively to maximize and minimize the probability of satisfying the game objective. The B\"uchi objective is to visit a given set of target states infinitely often. This can be seen as a special case of maximizing the expected $\limsup$ of the daily rewards, where all daily rewards are in $\{0,1\}$. The Transience objective is to visit no state infinitely often, i.e., every finite subset of the states is eventually left forever. Transience can only be met in infinite game graphs. We show that in B\"uchi games there always exist $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies that use just a step counter (discrete clock) plus 1 bit of public memory. This upper bound holds for all countable graphs, but it is a new result even for the special case of finite graphs. The upper bound is tight in the sense that Max strategies that use just a step counter, or just finite memory, are not sufficient even on finite game graphs. This upper bound is a consequence of a slightly stronger new result: $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the combined B\"uchi and Transience objective require just 1 bit of public memory (but cannot be memoryless). Our proof techniques also yield a closely related result, that $\varepsilon$-optimal Max strategies for the Transience objective alone can be chosen as memoryless.</description>

      <title>Particle Filter Optimization: A Bayesian Approach for Global Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel global optimization algorithm, Particle Filter-Based Optimization (PFO), designed for a class of stochastic optimization problems in which the objective function lacks an analytical form and is subject to noisy evaluations. PFO utilizes the Bayesian inference framework of Particle Filters (PF) by reformulating the optimization task as a state estimation problem. In this context, evaluations of the objective function are interpreted as measurements, and a customized transition model based on covariance ellipsoids is introduced to guide particle propagation. This model serves as a surrogate for classical acquisition functions, equipping the PF framework with local search capabilities and supporting efficient exploration of the global optimum. To mitigate the adverse effects of measurement noise, the Unscented Transform (UT) is employed to approximate the underlying mean of the objective function, enhancing the accuracy of particle updates. The algorithm offers notable improvements over existing stochastic optimization algorithms for black-box multi-modal objective functions. First, PFO provides a fully probabilistic definition of particle weights, enhancing adaptability and robustness. Second, PFO integrates exploration and exploitation within a unified Bayesian framework, ensuring a non-zero probability of sampling from unexplored regions throughout the optimization process. This approach contrasts with traditional particle filter methods that are primarily used for state estimation, and heuristic optimization algorithms that lack theoretical guarantees. The novelty of PFO lies in its unique integration of particle filtering with a dynamic search space prediction, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to acquisition functions in Bayesian Optimization (BO).</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithm achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we show that this does not extend to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), while it can be extended to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac Formula for Time-Dependent Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Applications in Numerical Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel Feynman-Kac formula and investigate learning-based methods for approximating general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations which may be high-dimensional. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose learning-based approaches for numerical approximations. To demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct numerical experiments in both low- and high-dimensional settings, complemented by a convergence analysis. These results address the open problem concerning deep-BSDE methods for numerical approximations of high-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (cf. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 15 (2018), pp. 8505-8510] and [Frontiers Sci. Awards Math. (2024), pp. 1-14] by Han, Jentzen, and E).</description>

      <title>Continuous-time persuasion by filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We frame dynamic persuasion in a partial observation stochastic control Leader-Follower game with an ergodic criterion. The Receiver controls the dynamics of a multidimensional unobserved state process. Information is provided to the Receiver through a device designed by the Sender that generates the observation process. The commitment of the Sender is enforced. We develop this approach in the case where all dynamics are linear and the preferences of the Receiver are linear-quadratic. We prove a verification theorem for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the HJB equation satisfied by the Receiver's value function. An extension to the case of persuasion of a mean field of interacting Receivers is also provided. We illustrate this approach in two applications: the provision of information to electricity consumers with a smart meter designed by an electricity producer; the information provided by carbon footprint accounting rules to companies engaged in a best-in-class emissions reduction effort. In the first application, we link the benefits of information provision to the mispricing of electricity production. In the latter, we show that information provision is a substitute for best-in-class objective.</description>

      <title>Computing Barycentres of Measures for Generic Transport Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein barycentres represent average distributions between multiple probability measures for the Wasserstein distance. The numerical computation of Wasserstein barycentres is notoriously challenging. A common approach is to use Sinkhorn iterations, where an entropic regularisation term is introduced to make the problem more manageable. Another approach involves using fixed-point methods, akin to those employed for computing Fr\'echet means on manifolds. The convergence of such methods for 2-Wasserstein barycentres, specifically with a quadratic cost function and absolutely continuous measures, was studied by Alvarez-Esteban et al. (2016). In this paper, we delve into the main ideas behind this fixed-point method and explore how it can be generalised to accommodate more diverse transport costs and generic probability measures, thereby extending its applicability to a broader range of problems. We show convergence results for this approach and illustrate its numerical behaviour on several barycentre problems.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching: Markov Kernels, Stochastic Processes and Transport Plans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.</description>

      <title>The Probability Spaces of QuickSort</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QuickSort and the analysis of its expected run time was presented 1962 in a classical paper by C.A.R Hoare. There the run time analysis hinges on a by now well known recurrence equation for the expected run time, which in turn was justified by referring to ``the law of conditional expectations''. A probability space for the runs of the algorithms was not constructed. Subsequent textbooks treated the recurrence relation as self evident and present it until this day without proof. Here we give an inductive definition of the probability space for the runs of randomized QuickSort and subsequently derive the recurrence equation with a not completely trivial proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the estimation of a rank-one tensor signal when only a portion $\varepsilon$ of its noisy observation is available. We show that the study of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose spectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results shed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial reduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of its entries.</description>

      <title>Hua-Chen New Theory of Economic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Between 1957-1985, Chinese mathematician Loo-Keng Hua pioneered economic optimization theory through three key contributions: establishing economic stability's fundamental theorem, proving the uniqueness of equilibrium solutions in economic systems, and developing a consumption-integrated model 50 days before his death. Since 1988, Mu-Fa Chen has been working on Hua's theory. He introduced stochastics, namely Markov chains, to economic optimization theory. He updated and developed Hua's model and came up with a new model (Chen's model) which has become the starting point of a new economic optimization theory. Chen's theory can be applied to economic stability test, bankruptcy prediction, product ranking and classification, economic prediction and adjustment, economic structure optimization. Chen's theory can also provide efficient algorithms that are programmable and intelligent. {Stochastics} is the cornerstone of Chen's theory. There is no overlap between Chen's theory, and the existing mathematical economy theory and the economics developments that were awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics between 1969 and 2024. The distinguished features of Chen's theory from the existing theories are quantitative, calculable, predictable, optimizable, programmable and can be intelligent. This survey provides a theoretical overview of the newly published monograph \cite{5rw24}. Specifically, the invariant of the economic structure matrix, also known as the Chen's invariant, was first published in this survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial ensemble filters implement triangular probability transport maps to reduce high-dimensional inference problems to sequences of state-by-state univariate inference problems. The univariate inference problems are solved by sampling posterior probability densities obtained by combining constructed prior densities with observational likelihoods according to Bayes' rule. Many serial filters in the literature focus on representing the marginal posterior densities of each state. However, rigorously capturing the conditional dependencies between the different univariate inferences is crucial to correctly sampling multidimensional posteriors. This work proposes a new serial ensemble filter, called the copula rank histogram filter (CoRHF), that seeks to capture the conditional dependency structure between variables via empirical copula estimates; these estimates are used to rigorously implement the triangular (state-by-state univariate) Bayesian inference. The success of the CoRHF is demonstrated on two-dimensional examples and the Lorenz '63 problem. A practical extension to the high-dimensional setting is developed by localizing the empirical copula estimation, and is demonstrated on the Lorenz '96 problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations,to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations are carried out for turbulent and laminar flows in full space and wall-bounded space, considering both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, thereby demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new measure of dependence that quantifies the degree to which a random variable $Y$ depends on a random vector $X$. This measure is zero if and only if $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and equals one if and only if $Y$ is a measurable function of $X$. We introduce a simple and interpretable estimator that is comparable in ease of computation to classical correlation coefficients such as Pearson's, Spearman's, or Chatterjee's. Building on this coefficient, we develop a model-free variable selection algorithm, feature ordering by dependence (FORD), inspired by FOCI. FORD requires no tuning parameters and is provably consistent under suitable sparsity assumptions. We demonstrate its effectiveness and improvements over FOCI through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>
