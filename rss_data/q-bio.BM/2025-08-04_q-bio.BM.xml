      <title>Contrastive Multi-Task Learning with Solvent-Aware Augmentation for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements, including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1% in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and advancing structure-based drug design.</description>

      <title>Pi-SAGE: Permutation-invariant surface-aware graph encoder for binding affinity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein surface fingerprint encodes chemical and geometric features that govern protein-protein interactions and can be used to predict changes in binding affinity between two protein complexes. Current state-of-the-art models for predicting binding affinity change, such as GearBind, are all-atom based geometric models derived from protein structures. Although surface properties can be implicitly learned from the protein structure, we hypothesize that explicit knowledge of protein surfaces can improve a structure-based model's ability to predict changes in binding affinity. To this end, we introduce Pi-SAGE, a novel Permutation-Invariant Surface-Aware Graph Encoder. We first train Pi-SAGE to create a protein surface codebook directly from the structure and assign a token for each surface-exposed residue. Next, we augment the node features of the GearBind model with surface features from domain-adapted Pi-SAGE to predict binding affinity change on the SKEMPI dataset. We show that explicitly incorporating local, context-aware chemical properties of residues enhances the predictive power of all-atom graph neural networks in modeling binding affinity changes between wild-type and mutant proteins.</description>

      <title>FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at \href{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Across Organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching. The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants, such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.</description>
