      <title>Measures in the dual of $BV$: perimeter bounds and relations with divergence-measure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze some properties of the measures in the dual of the space $BV$, by considering (signed) Radon measures satisfying a perimeter bound condition, which means that the absolute value of the measure of a set is controlled by the perimeter of the set itself, and whose total variations also belong to the dual of $BV$. We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in particular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving the stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a suitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is of separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating $\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These results are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak solutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data, which is explored in a subsequent work.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of measure-valued agents in the space of probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the development of dynamics in probability spaces, we propose a novel multi-agent dynamic of consensus type where each agent is a probability measure. The agents move instantaneously towards a weighted barycenter of the ensemble according to the 2-Wasserstein metric. We mathematically describe the evolution as a system of measure differential inclusions and show the existence of solutions for compactly supported initial data. Inspired by the consensus-based optimization, we apply the multi-agent system to solve a minimization problem over the space of probability measures. In the small numerical example, each agent is described by a particle approximation and aims to approximate a target measure.</description>

      <title>Brezis--Browder type results for Fractional Sobolev spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove Brezis--Browder type results for homogeneous fractional Sobolev spaces $\mathring{H}^s(\R^d)$ and quantitive type estimates for $s$--harmonic functions.
  We further relate such outcomes with the question of whether a linear and continuous functional $T$ defined on $\mathring{H}^s(\R^d)$ admits (up to a constant) an integral representation of its norm in terms of the Coulomb type energy
  $$\|T\|^2_{\mathring{H}^{-s}(\R^d)}=\int_{\R^d}\int_{\R^d}\frac{T(x)T(y)}{|x-y|^{d-2s}}dx dy. $$</description>

      <title>On uniqueness for hyperbolic half-wave maps in dimension $d \geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a uniqueness result for the half-wave maps equation in dimension $d \geq 3$ in the natural energy class with $\mathbb{H}^2$ target. We first reformulate the half-wave maps equation into a wave maps equation, then isometrically embed $\mathbb{H}^2$ into some $\mathbb{R}^m$ using the Nash embedding, and then use a Gr\"{o}nwall's argument.</description>

      <title>Vorticity blowup in 2D compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove finite-time vorticity blowup for smooth solutions of the 2D compressible Euler equations with smooth, localized, and non-vacuous initial data. The vorticity blowup occurs at the time of the first singularity, and is accompanied by an axisymmetric implosion in which the swirl velocity enjoys full stability, as opposed to finite co-dimension stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a determining wavenumber for weak solutions of 3D Navier-Stokes equations whose time average is bounded by Kolmogorov dissipation wavenumber over the whole range of intermittency dimensions. This improves previous works by Cheskidov, Dai and Kavlie in 2018 and that by Cheskidov and Dai in 2019.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of Leray weak solutions of the forced MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we exhibit non-uniqueness of Leray weak solutions of the forced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD for short) equations. Similar to the solutions constructed in \cite{ABC2}, we first find a special steady solution of ideal MHD equations whose linear unstability was proved in \cite{Lin}. It is possible to perturb the unstable scenario of ideal MHD to 3D viscous and resistive MHD equations, which can be regarded as the first unstable "background" solution. Our perturbation argument is based on the spectral theoretic approach \cite{Kato}. The second solution we would construct is a trajectory on the unstable manifold associated to the unstable steady solution. It is worth noting that these solutions live precisely on the borderline of the known well-posedness theory.</description>

      <title>On fractional Hardy-type inequalities in general open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, when $sp&gt;N$, the sharp Hardy constant $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ of the punctured space $\mathbb R^N\setminus\{0\}$ in the Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} space provides an optimal lower bound for the Hardy constant $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}(\Omega)$ of an open $\Omega\subsetneq \mathbb R^N$. The proof exploits the characterization of Hardy's inequality in the fractional setting in terms of positive local weak supersolutions of the relevant Euler-Lagrange equation and relies on the construction of suitable supersolutions by means of the distance function from the boundary of $\Omega$. Moreover, we compute the limit of $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ as $s\nearrow 1$, as well as the limit when $p \nearrow \infty$. Finally, we apply our results to establish a lower bound for the non-local eigenvalue $\lambda_{s,p}(\Omega)$ in terms of $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ when $sp&gt;N$, which, in turn, gives an improved Cheeger inequality whose constant does not vanish as $p\nearrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Superlinsing using sign-changing metamaterials on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study composite assemblages of dielectrics and metamaterials with respectively positive and negative material parameters. In the continuum case, for a scalar equation, such media may exhibit so-called plasmonic resonances for certain values of the (negative) conductivity in the metamaterial. This work investigates such resonances, and the associated eigenfunctions, in the case of composite conducting networks. Unlike the continuous media, we show a surprising specific dependence on the geometry of the network of the resonant values. We also study how the problem is affected by the choice of boundary conditions on the external nodes of the structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions of the Cauchy problem for semilinear equations with (possibly) different L\'evy operators. We provide various results on their convergence under the assumption that symbols of the involved operators converge to the symbol of some L\'evy operator. Some results are proved for a more general class of pseudodifferential operators.</description>

      <title>An Extended AW-Rascle Model with Source Terms and Its Numerical Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations govern continuum traffic flow models. Higher-order traffic flow models consisting of continuum equations and velocity dynamics were introduced to address the limitations of the Lighthill, Whitham, and Richards (LWR) model. However, these models are ineffective in incorporating road heterogeneity. This paper integrates an extended AW-Rascle higher-order model with the source terms in the continuum equation to predict the traffic states in heterogeneous road conditions. The system of the equations was solved numerically with the central dispersion (CD) method incorporated into the standard McCormack scheme. Smoothing is applied to take care of the numerical oscillation of the higher-order model. Different combinations of initial conditions with source terms showed that the proposed model with the numerical methods could produce a stable solution and eliminate oscillation of the McCormack scheme.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a nonlinear fish-bone model for suspension bridges with rigid hangers in the presence of flow effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic system of nonlinear partial differential equations modeling the motions of a suspension bridge. This fish-bone model captures the flexural displacements of the bridge deck's mid-line, and each chordal filament's rotation angle from the centerline. These two dynamics are strongly coupled through the effect of cable-hanger, appearing through a sublinear function. Additionally, a structural nonlinearity of Woinowsky-Krieger type is included, allowing for large displacements. Well-posedness of weak solutions is shown and long-time dynamics are studied. In particular, to force the dynamics, we invoke a non-conservative potential flow approximation which, although greatly simplified from the full multi-physics fluid-structure interaction, provides a driver for non-trivial end behaviors. We describe the conditions under which the dynamics are uniformly stable, as well as demonstrate the existence of a compact global attractor under all nonlinear and non-conservative effects. To do so, we invoke the theory of quasi-stability, first explicitly constructing an absorbing ball via stability estimates and, subsequently, demonstrating a stabilizability estimate on trajectory differences applied to the aforesaid absorbing ball. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to examine the possible end behaviors of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence of positive solutions for Kirchhoff type problems with critical exponent in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by using variational methods we study the existence of positive solutions for the following Kirchhoff type problem: $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\left(a+b\mathlarger{\int}_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^{2}dx\right)\Delta u+V(x)u=u^{5}, \ &amp; x\in\Omega,\\ \\ u=0,\ &amp; x\in\partial \Omega, \end{array}\right. $$ where $a&gt;0$, $b\geq0$, $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^3$ is an unbounded exterior domain, $\partial\Omega\neq\emptyset$, $\mathbb{R}^{3}\backslash\Omega$ is bounded, $u\in D_{0}^{1,2}(\Omega)$, and $V\in L^{\frac{3}{2}}(\Omega)$ is a non-negative continuous function. It turns out that the above Kirchhoff equation has no ground state solution. Nonetheless, by establishing some global compact lemma and constructing a suitable minimax value $c$ at a higher energy level where so called Palais-Smale condition holds, we succeed to obtain a positive solution for such a problem whenever $V$ and the hole $\mathbb{R}^{3}\setminus\Omega$ are suitable small in some senses. To the best of our knowledge, there are few similar results published in the literature concerning the existence of positive solutions for Kirchhoff equation in exterior domains. Our result also holds true in the case $\Omega=\mathbb R^3$, particularly, if $a=1$ and $b=0$, we improve some existing results (such as Benci, Cerami, Existence of positive solutions of the equation $-\Delta u+a(x)u=u^{(N+2)/(N-2)}$ in $\emph{R}^{N}$, J. Funct. Anal., 88 (1990), 90--117) for the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation in the whole space.</description>

      <title>On Arnold-type stability theorems for the Euler equation on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish three Arnold-type stability theorems for steady or rotating solutions of the incompressible Euler equation on a sphere. Specifically, we prove that if the stream function of a flow solves a semilinear elliptic equation with a monotone nonlinearity, then, under appropriate conditions, the flow is stable or orbitally stable in the Lyapunov sense. In particular, our theorems apply to degree-2 Rossby-Haurwitz waves. These results are achieved via a variational approach, with the key ingredient being to show that the flows under consideration satisfy the conditions of two Burton-type stability criteria which are established in this paper. As byproducts, we obtain some sharp rigidity results for solutions of semilinear elliptic equations on a sphere.</description>

In particular, we will discuss the existence, non-existence and uniqueness of solutions in terms of the summability of $f$ and of the value of the parameter $\gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish the formation of singularities of classical solutions with finite energy of the forced fractional Navier Stokes equations where the dissipative term is given by $|\nabla|^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha\in [0, \alpha_0)$ ($\alpha_0 = \frac{22-8\sqrt7}{9} &gt; 0$). We construct solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3\times [0,T]$ with a finite $T&gt;0$ and with an external forcing which is in $L^1_t([0, T]) C_x^{1,\epsilon}\cap L^2$, such that on the time interval $0 \le t &lt; T$, the velocity $u$ is in the space $C^\infty\cap L^2$ and such that as the time $t$ approaches the blow-up moment $T$, the integral $\int_0^t |\nabla u| ds$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for Poisson learning to a Poisson equation with measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove discrete to continuum convergence rates for Poisson Learning, a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm that is based on solving the graph Poisson equation with a source term consisting of a linear combination of Dirac deltas located at labeled points and carrying label information. The corresponding continuum equation is a Poisson equation with measure data in a Euclidean domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. The singular nature of these equations is challenging and requires an approach with several distinct parts: (1) We prove quantitative error estimates when convolving the measure data of a Poisson equation with (approximately) radial function supported on balls. (2) We use quantitative variational techniques to prove discrete to continuum convergence rates on random geometric graphs with bandwidth $\varepsilon&gt;0$ for bounded source terms. (3) We show how to regularize the graph Poisson equation via mollification with the graph heat kernel, and we study fine asymptotics of the heat kernel on random geometric graphs. Combining these three pillars we obtain $L^1$ convergence rates that scale, up to logarithmic factors, like $O(\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{d+2}})$ for general data distributions, and $O(\varepsilon^{\frac{2-\sigma}{d+4}})$ for uniformly distributed data, where $\sigma&gt;0$. These rates are valid with high probability if $\varepsilon\gg\left({\log n}/{n}\right)^q$ where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the graph and $q \approx \frac{1}{3d}$.</description>

      <title>Sharp non-uniqueness for the 2D hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the non-uniqueness of weak solutions for the two-dimensional hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes equations in the super-critical spaces $L_{t}^{\gamma}W_{x}^{s,p}$ when $\alpha\in[1,\frac{3}{2})$, and obtain the conclusion that the non-uniqueness of the weak solutions at the two endpoints is sharp in view of the generalized Lady\v{z}enskaja-Prodi-Serrin condition with the triplet $(s,\gamma,p)=(s,\infty, \frac{2}{2\alpha-1+s})$ and $(s, \frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha-1+s}, \infty)$. As a good observation, we use the intermittency of the temporal concentrated function in an almost optimal way, and establish its relationship with the viscosity exponent $\alpha$ as well as the regularity of the weak solutions. The research results extend the recent elegant works on 2D Navier-Stokes equations in [Cheskidov and Luo, Invent. Math., 229 (2022), pp. 987--1054; Cheskidov and Luo, Ann. PDE, 9:13 (2023)] to the hyper-dissipative case $\alpha \in(1,\frac{3}{2})$, and are also applicable in Lebesgue and Besov spaces. It is proved that even in the case of high viscosity, the behavior of the solution remains unpredictable and stochastic due to the lack of integrability and regularity.</description>

      <title>Dissipation enhancing properties for a class of Hamiltonian flows with closed streamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a passive scalar subject to molecular diffusion and advected by an incompressible velocity field on a 2D bounded domain. The velocity field is $u = \nabla^\perp H$, where H is an autonomous Hamiltonian whose level sets are Jordan curves foliating the domain. We focus on the high P\'eclet number regime ($Pe := \nu^{-1} \gg 1$), where two distinct processes unfold on well separated time-scales: streamline averaging and standard diffusion. For a specific class of Hamiltonians with one non-degenerate elliptic point (including perturbed radial flows), we prove exponential convergence of the solution to its streamline average on a subdiffusive time-scale $T_\nu \ll \nu^{-1}$ ,up to a small correction related to the shape of the streamlines. The time-scale $T_\nu$ is determined by the behavior of the period function around the elliptic point. To establish this result, we introduce a model problem arising naturally from the difference between the solution and its streamline average. We use pseudospectral estimates to infer decay in the model problem, and, in fact, this analysis extends to a broader class of Hamiltonian flows. Finally, we perform an asymptotic expansion of the full solution, revealing that the leading terms consist of the streamline average and the solution of the model problem.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates and Strichartz inequalities for a class of dispersive equations on H-type groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the sub-Laplacian on H-type groups and $\phi: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function. The primary objective of the paper is to study the decay estimate for a class of dispersive semigroup given by $e^{it\phi(\mathcal{L})}$. Inspired by earlier work of Guo-Peng-Wang \cite{GPW2008} in the Euclidean space and Song-Yang \cite{SY2023} on the Heisenberg group, we overcome the difficulty arising from the non-homogeneousness of $\phi$ by frequency localization, which is based on the non-commutative Fourier transform on H-type groups, the properties of the Laguerre functions and Bessel functions, and the stationary phase theorem. Finally, as applications, we derive the new Strichartz inequalities for the solutions of some specific equations, such as the fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation, the beam equation and the Klein-Gordon equation, which corresponds to $\phi(r)=r^\alpha$, $r^2+r,\sqrt{1+r^2},\sqrt{1+r}$, respectively. Moreover, we also prove that the time decay is sharp in these cases.</description>

      <title>Blowing-up solutions for the Choquard type Brezis-Nirenberg problem in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the existence of solutions for the following Choquard type Brezis-Nirenberg problem \begin{align*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u=\displaystyle\Big(\int\limits_{\Omega}\frac{u^{6-\alpha}(y)}{|x-y|^\alpha}dy\Big)u^{5-\alpha}+\lambda u,
  \ \ &amp;\mbox{in}\ \Omega,
  u=0,
  \ \ &amp;\mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{align*} where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $\alpha\in (0,3)$, $6-\alpha$ is the upper critical exponent in the sense of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, and $\lambda$ is a real positive parameter. By applying the reduction argument, we find and characterize a positive value $\lambda_0$ such that if $\lambda-\lambda_0&gt;0$ is small enough, then the above problem admits a solution, which blows up and concentrates at the critical point of the Robin function as $\lambda\rightarrow \lambda_0$. Moreover, we consider the above problem under zero Neumann boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability of the total $Q$-curvature near minimizing metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under appropriate positivity hypotheses, we prove quantitative estimates for the total $k$-th order $Q$-curvature functional near minimizing metrics on any smooth, closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold for every integer $1 \leq k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$. More precisely, we show that on a generic closed Riemannian manifold the distance to the minimizing set of metrics is controlled quadratically by the $Q$-curvature energy deficit, extending recent work by Engelstein, Neumayer and Spolaor in the case $k=1$. Next we prove, for any integer $1 \leq k&lt; \frac{n}{2}$, the existence of an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold such that the $k$-th order $Q$-curvature deficit controls a higher power of the distance to the minimizing set. We believe that these degenerate examples are of independent interest and can be used for further development in the field.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Green tensor estimates of the nonstationary Stokes system in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a series of applications of the pointwise estimates of the (unrestricted) Green tensor of the nonstationary Stokes system in the half space, established in our previous work [CMP 2023]. First, we show the $L^1$-$L^q$ estimates for the Stokes flow with possibly non-solenoidal $L^1$ initial data, generalizing the results of Giga-Matsui-Shimizu [Math. Z. 1999] and Desch-Hieber-Pr\"uss [J. Evol. Equ. 2001]. Second, we construct mild solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the half space with mixed-type pointwise decay or with pointwise decay alongside boundary vanishing. Finally, we explore various coupled fluid systems in the half space including viscous resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations, a coupled system for the flow and the magnetic field of MHD type, and the nematic liquid crystal flow. For each of these systems, we construct mild solutions in $L^q$, pointwise decay, and uniformly local $L^q$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Quadratic cones on which few harmonic functions vanish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in dimension three and higher, the space of harmonic functions vanishing on the cone defined by a generically chosen harmonic quadratic polynomial is two-dimensional. This phenomenon is surprisingly robust, generalizing to arbitrary elliptic differential operators of second order, with the cone replaced by the level set of a solution at a nondegenerate critical value. As long as the tangent cone to the level set at the critical point satisfies a certain genericity condition, the space of solutions vanishing on the level set is at most two-dimensional.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the higher order Schr\"odinger operator $H=(-\Delta)^m+V(x)$ in $n$ dimensions with real-valued potential $V$ when $n&gt;4m$, $m\in \mathbb N$. We adapt our recent results for $m&gt;1$ to show that when $H$ has a threshold eigenvalue the wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ for the natural range $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2m}$ in both even and odd dimensions. The approach used works without distinguishing even and odd cases, and matches the range of boundedness in the classical case when $m=1$. The proof applies in the classical $m=1$ case as well and simplifies the argument.</description>

      <title>Dirac cones and magic angles in the Bistritzer--MacDonald TBG Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generic existence of Dirac cones in the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted bilayer graphene. Its complementary set, when Dirac cones are absent, is the set of magic angles. We show the stability of magic angles obtained in the chiral limit by demonstrating that the perfectly flat bands transform into quadratic band crossings when perturbing away from the chiral limit. Moreover, using the invariance of Euler number, we show that at magic angles there are more band crossings beyond these quadratic band crossings. This is the first result showing the existence of magic angles for the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian and solves Open Problem No.2 proposed in the recent survey arXiv:2310.20642.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the stability constant for the truncated Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the inverse problem of recovering a compact supported function from its truncated Fourier transform. We derive new Lipschitz stability estimates for the inversion in terms of the truncation parameter. The obtained results show that the Lipschitz constant is of order one when the truncation parameter is larger than the spatial frequency of the function, and it grows exponentially when the truncation parameter tends to zero. Finally, we present some numerical examples of reconstruction of a compactly supported function from its noisy truncated Fourier transform. The numerical illustrations validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the support of solutions to nonlinear stochastic heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the strict positivity and the compact support property of solutions to the one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic heat equation: $$\partial_t u(t,x) = \frac{1}{2}\partial^2_x u(t,x) + \sigma(u(t,x))\dot{W}(t,x), \quad (t,x)\in \mathbf{R}_+\times\mathbf{R},$$ with nonnegative and compactly supported initial data $u_0$, where $\dot{W}$ is the space-time white noise and $\sigma:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R} $ is a continuous function with $\sigma(0)=0$. We prove that (i) if $v/ \sigma(v)$ is sufficiently large near $v=0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ is strictly positive for all $t&gt;0$, and (ii) if $v/\sigma(v)$ is sufficiently small near $v= 0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ has compact support for all $t&gt;0$. These findings extend previous results concerning the strict positivity and the compact support property, which were analyzed only for the case $\sigma(u)\approx u^\gamma$ for $\gamma&gt;0$. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of a solution and the weak comparison principle in case (i).</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for a class of stochastic partial differential equations by adding a suitable nonlinear noise, while the corresponding deterministic equations may only have local solutions. In particular, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system.
  Furthermore, our main results have broad applications, including not only all locally monotone stochastic equations in the variational framework (cf. \cite{LR2,LR1,RSZ1}), but also several new models such as stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations and stochastic surface growth models, which provide positive answers to some longstanding open problems in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Euler-Poisson equations for polytropes $P(\rho)=K\rho^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma\in \left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3} \right]$ and the white dwarf stars. For $\gamma=\frac{4}{3},$ we show that there exists a global weak solution for the spherically symmetric initial data with mass less than the mass of the Lane-Emden stars (i.e. non-rotating polytropes). For $\gamma\in \left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3} \right)$, we show the existence of global weak solution for spherical symmetric initial data in an invariant set containing a neighborhood of Lane-Emden stars. Moreover, the support of these solution expands to infinity. As a corollary, this proves the strong instability of the Lane-Emden stars for $\gamma\in \left( \frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3}\right] $. For $\gamma\in \left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3} \right),$ our results provide the first example of expanding solutions. For white dwarf stars, we prove that the solution cannot collapse if the mass of initial data is less than the Chandrasekhar limit mass, which is the supremum of the mass of the non-rotating white dwarf stars. Our proof strongly uses the variational characterization of the Lane-Emden stars. First, we relate the best constant of a Hardy-Littlewood type inequality with the mass of the Lane-Emden stars with $\gamma=\frac{4}{3}$, which is further shown to equal the Chandrasekhar limit mass. For $\gamma\in\left( \frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3}\right) $, we show that the Lane-Emden stars are minimizers of an energy-mass functional subject to a Pohozaev type constraint. This is crucial in the construction of the invariant set of expanding solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate long time asymptotics of the modified Camassa-Holm equation in three transition zones under a nonzero background. The first transition zone lies between the soliton region and the first oscillatory region, the second one lies between the second oscillatory region and the fast decay region, and possibly, the third one, namely, the collisionless shock region, that bridges the first transition region and the first oscillatory region. Under a low regularity condition on the initial data, we obtain Painlev\'e-type asymptotic formulas in the first two transition regions, while the transient asymptotics in the third region involves the Jacobi theta function. We establish our results by performing a $\bar{\partial}$ nonlinear steepest descent analysis to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if an N-vortex pair nearly minimizes the Yang-Mills-Higgs energy, then it is second order close to a minimizer. First we use new weighted inequalities in two dimensions and compactness arguments to show stability for sections with some regularity. Second we define a selection principle using a penalized functional and by elliptic regularity and smooth perturbation of complex polynomials, we generalize the stability to all nearly minimizing pairs. With the same method, we also prove the analogous second order stability for nearly minimizing pairs on nontrivial line bundles over arbitrary compact smooth surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give conditions that guarantee uniqueness of renormalized solutions for the Maxwell-Stefan system. The proof is based on an identity for the evolution of the symmetrized relative entropy. Using the method of doubling the variables we derive the identity for two renormalized solutions and use information on the spectrum of the Maxwell-Stefan matrix to estimate the symmetrized relative entropy and show uniqueness. We then show that weak solutions for the Maxwell-Stefan system have sufficient regularity to produce renormalized solutions. Combining the two results yields a uniqueness result for weak solutions of the Maxwell-Stefan system with bounded fluxes.</description>

      <title>Boundary controllability for degenerate/singular hyperbolic equations in nondivergence form with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the null controllability for a degenerate/singular wave equation with drift in non divergence form. In particular, considering a control localized on the non degenerate boundary point, we provide some conditions for the boundary controllability via energy methods and boundary observability.</description>

      <title>On Bobkov-Tanaka type spectrum for the double-phase operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving from the seminal papers by Bobkov and Tanaka \cite{BT,BT2,BT3} on the spectrum of the $(p,q)$-Laplacian, we analyze the case of the double-phase operator. We discuss the region of parameters in which existence and non-existence of positive solutions occur. The proofs are based on normalization procedures, the Nehari manifold, and truncation techniques, exploiting Picone-type inequalities and an ad-hoc strong maximum principle.</description>

      <title>On posterior consistency of data assimilation with Gaussian process priors: the 2D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-linear Bayesian data assimilation model for the periodic two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with initial condition modelled by a Gaussian process prior. We show that if the system is updated with sufficiently many discrete noisy measurements of the velocity field, then the posterior distribution eventually concentrates near the ground truth solution of the time evolution equation, and in particular that the initial condition is recovered consistently by the posterior mean vector field. We further show that the convergence rate can in general not be faster than inverse logarithmic in sample size, but describe specific conditions on the initial conditions when faster rates are possible. In the proofs we provide an explicit quantitative estimate for backward uniqueness of solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Power-Enhanced Residual Network for Function Approximation and Physics-Informed Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate how the updating of weights during forward operation and the computation of gradients during backpropagation impact the optimization process, training procedure, and overall performance of the neural network, particularly the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This paper introduces a novel neural network structure called the Power-Enhancing residual network, inspired by highway network and residual network, designed to improve the network's capabilities for both smooth and non-smooth functions approximation in 2D and 3D settings. By incorporating power terms into residual elements, the architecture enhances the stability of weight updating, thereby facilitating better convergence and accuracy. The study explores network depth, width, and optimization methods, showing the architecture's adaptability and performance advantages. Consistently, the results emphasize the exceptional accuracy of the proposed Power-Enhancing residual network, particularly for non-smooth functions. Real-world examples also confirm its superiority over plain neural network in terms of accuracy, convergence, and efficiency. Moreover, the proposed architecture is also applied to solving the inverse Burgers' equation, demonstrating superior performance. In conclusion, the Power-Enhancing residual network offers a versatile solution that significantly enhances neural network capabilities by emphasizing the importance of stable weight updates for effective training in deep neural networks.

      <title>Characteristic Gluing with $\Lambda$: II. Linearised equations in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a gluing theorem for linearised vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge on a class of characteristic hypersurfaces in static vacuum $(n+1)$-dimensional backgrounds with cosmological constant $ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, $n\ge 4$. This generalises, in the linearised case, the pioneering analysis of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out on light cones in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and classification of solutions to an integral equation in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove symmetry of nonnegative solutions of the integral equation \[ u (\zeta ) = \int\limits_{{\mathbb H}^n} |\zeta^{-1} \xi|^{-(Q-\alpha)} u(\xi)^{p} d\xi \quad 1&lt; p \leq \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha},\quad 0&lt; \alpha &lt;Q \] on the Heisenberg group ${\mathbb H}^n = {\mathbb C}^n \times {\mathbb R}$, $Q= 2n +2$ using the moving plane method and the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality proved by Frank and Lieb for the Heisenberg group. For $p$ subcritical, i.e., $1&lt; p &lt; \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha}$ we show nonexistence of positive solution of this integral equation, while for the critical case, $p = \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha}$ we prove that the solutions are cylindrical and are unique upto Heisenberg translation and suitable scaling of the function \[ u_0 (z,t) = \left( (1+ |z|^2)^2 + t^2 \right)^{- \frac{Q-\alpha}{4}} \quad (z,t ) \in {\mathbb H}^n. \] As a consequence, we also obtain the symmetry and classification of nonnegative $C^2$ solution of the equation \[ \Delta_{\mathbb H} u + u^{p} = 0 \quad \mbox{for } 1&lt; p \leq \frac{Q+\alpha}{Q-\alpha} \mbox{ in } {\mathbb H}^n \] without any partial symmetry assumption on the function $u$.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic autonomous robustness of random attractors for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the existence and asymptotically autonomous robustness (AAR) (almost surely) of random attractors for 3D stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations (SGMNSE) on Poincar\'e domains (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aim is to investigate the existence and AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE when the time-dependent forcing converges to a time-independent function under the perturbation of linear multiplicative noise as well as additive noise. The main approach is to provide a way to justify that, on some uniformly tempered universe, the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform across an infinite time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. The backward uniform ``tail-smallness'' and ``flattening-property'' of the solutions over $(-\infty,\tau]$ have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the existence as well as AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE on unbounded domains.</description>
