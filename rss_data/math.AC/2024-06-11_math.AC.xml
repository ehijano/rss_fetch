      <title>The $F$-pure threshold and squarefree initial ideal as invariants of linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generic link of an unmixed, radical (even a generic complete intersection) ideal is radical (in fact, prime). We show that this cannot be strengthened in general: The squarefreeness of the initial ideal and $F$-purity are not preserved along generic links. However, for several important cases in liaison theory, including generic height three Gorenstein ideals and the maximal minors of a generic matrix, we show that the squarefreeness of the initial ideal, $F$-purity, and even the $F$-pure threshold are each preserved along the $n$-th generic link for every $n&gt;0$ by finding a property of such ideals which propagates along generic links. We use this property to establish the $F$-regularity of their generic links. Finally, we study the $F$-pure thresholds of the generic residual intersections of a complete intersection ideal and answer a related question of Kim--Miller--Niu.</description>

      <title>On some Rings of differentiable type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic 0 and $S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_m]/I$ be an affine domain. Consider $R=S_P$ where $P\in Spec(S)$ such that $R$ is regular. In this paper we construct a field $F$ which is contained in $R$ such that
  (1) The residue field of $R$ is a finite extension of $F$.
  (2) $D_F(R)$, the ring of $F$-linear differential operators on $R$ is left and right Noetherian with finite global dimension.
  (3) The Bernstein class of $D_F(R)$ is closed under localization at one element of $R$.
  We also prove a similar result for $R^h$, the Henselization of $R$. As an application we prove that $\frac{D_F(R)}{D_F(R)P}\cong E(\kappa(P))$ where $E(\kappa(P))$ is the injective hull of the residue field of $R$.</description>

      <title>Binomial expansion and the $\mathrm{v}$-number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $I\subset A$ and $J\subset B$ be two monomial ideals, where $A$ and $B$ are two polynomial rings with disjoint variables. Considering a general set-up of monomial filtrations, we study the behaviour of the $\mathrm{v}$-function under binomial expansion. As an application, we get an explicit formula of $\mathrm{v}((I+J)^{(k)})$ in terms of $\mathrm{v}(I^{(i)})$ and $\mathrm{v}(J^{(j)})$, where $L^{(k)}$ denote the symbolic power of an ideal $L$. Furthermore, an analogous formula is extended for the $\mathrm{v}$-function of integral closure of $(I+J)^k$.</description>

      <title>Almost Gorenstein simplicial semigroup rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a criterion for almost Gorenstein property for semigroup rings associated with simplicial semigroups. We extend Nari's theorem for almost symmetric numerical semigroups to simplicial semigroups with higher rank. By this criterion, we determine $2$-dimensional normal semigroup rings which have ``Ulrich elements'' defined in [Herzog-Jafari-Stamate].</description>

      <title>On Conjecture of Binomial Edge Ideals of Linear Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ideal $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ is said to be of {\emph{linear type}} when its Rees algebra and symmetric algebra exhibit isomorphism. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture put forth by Jayanthan, Kumar, and Sarkar (2021) that if $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph, then the binomial edge ideal of $G$ is of linear type. Our investigation validates this conjecture for trees. However, our study reveals that not all unicyclic graphs adhere to this conjecture. Furthermore, we provide an explicit description of the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of binomial edge ideals of trees and demonstrate that these algebras are Cohen-Macaulay. Finally, we conclude the equality between symbolic powers and ordinary powers of binomial edge ideals of trees.</description>

      <title>Jordan degree type for codimension three Gorenstein algebras of small Sperner number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jordan type $P_{A,\ell}$ of a linear form $\ell$ acting on a graded Artinian algebra $A$ over a field $\sf k$ is the partition describing the Jordan block decomposition of the multiplication map $m_\ell$, which is nilpotent. The Jordan degree type $\mathcal S_{A,\ell}$ is a finer invariant, describing also the initial degrees of the simple submodules of $A$ in a decomposition of $A$ as ${\sf k}[\ell]$-modules. The set of Jordan types of $A$ or Jordan degree types (JDT) of $A$ as $\ell$ varies, is an invariant of the algebra. This invariant has been studied for codimension two graded algebras. We here extend the previous results to certain codimension three graded Artinian Gorenstein (AG) algebras - those of small Sperner number. Given a Gorenstein sequence $T$ - one possible for the Hilbert function of a codimension three AG algebra - the irreducible variety $\mathrm{Gor}(T)$ parametrizes all Gorenstein algebras of Hilbert function $T$. We here completely determine the JDT possible for all pairs $(A,\ell), A\in \mathrm{Gor}(T)$, for Gorenstein sequences $T$ of the form $T=(1,3,s^k,3,1)$ for Sperner number $s=3,4,5$ and arbitrary multiplicity $k$. For $s=6$ we delimit the prospective JDT, without verifying that each occurs.</description>

Abstract: We consider the ideal of inner $2$-minors $I_{\mathcal{P}}$ of a finite set of cells $\mathcal{P}$, which we call the cell ideal of $\mathcal{P}$. A nice interpretation for the height of an unmixed ideal $I_{\mathcal{P}}$, in terms of the number of cells of $\mathcal{P}$ is given. Moreover, the coordinate rings of cell ideals with isolated singularities are determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce toric rings of multicomplexes. We show how to compute the divisor class group and the class of the canonical module when the toric ring is normal. In the special case that the multicomplex is a discrete polymatroid, its toric ring is studied deeply for several classes of polymatroids.</description>

Abstract: Let $L_n$ be a line graph with $n$ vertices and let $I$ be its $t$-path ideal. It is shown that $I^s$ has a linear resolution for some $s\geq 1$ (or equivalently for all $s\geq 1$) if and only if $I^s$ has linear quotients for some $s\geq 1$ (or equivalently for all $s\geq 1$) if and only if $t\leq n\leq 2t$. In addition, we present an explicit formula for the regularity of $I^s$ for all $s\geq 1$. It turns out it is linear in $s$ from the very beginning.</description>

      <title>Macaulay Posets and Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macaulay posets are posets in which an analog of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem holds. Macaulay rings (also called Macaulay-Lex rings) are rings in which an analog of Macaulay's Theorem for lex ideals holds. The study of both of these objects started with Macaulay almost a century ago. Since then, these two branches have developed separately over the past century, with the last link being the Clements-Lindstr\"om Theorem.
  For every ring that is the quotient of a polynomial ring by a homogeneous ideal we define the poset of monomials. Under certain conditions, we prove a Macaulay Correspondence Theorem, a ring is Macaulay if and only if its poset of monomials is Macaulay. Furthermore, the tensor product of rings corresponds to the Cartesian product of the posets of monomials. This allows us to transfer results between rings and posets. By using this translation, we give several answers to a problem posed by Mermin and Peeva, a positive answer to Hoefel's question about applying Macaulay poset theory to ring theory, and deduce several other results in algebra and combinatorics.
  A new proof of the Mermin-Murai Theorem on colored square free rings is presented by using star posets. We extend the Mermin-Murai Theorem to rings that are not square free. Using a result from Mermin and Peeva we give an answer to a question posed by Bezrukov and Leck. Some results of Chong also give answers to the Bezrukov-Leck problem. All of these results have a common feature. They involve the tensor product of rings whose Hasse graphs of the poset of monomials are trees. We call such rings, tree rings. We give a classification of Macaulay rings that are the tensor product of a tree ring. Finally, we show that there are Macaulay rings that are not the tensor product of tree rings, and present the first examples of Macaulay rings that are not quotients by a monomial ideal and not quotients by a toric ideal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and let $I$ be the $t$-path ideal of the line graph $L_n$ with $n$-vertices. It is shown that the set of associated prime ideals of $I^s$ is equal to the set of minimal prime ideals of $I$ for all $s\geq 1$, and we provide an explicit description of these prime ideals. Additionally, as the main contribution of this paper, we derive an explicit formula for the multiplicity of $S/I^s$ for all $s\geq 1$, revealing that it is a polynomial in $s$ from the beginning.</description>

      <title>Splittings of toric ideals of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph on the vertex set $\{v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}\}$. An algebraic object attached to $G$ is the toric ideal $I_G$. We say that $I_G$ is subgraph splittable if there exist subgraphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ of $G$ such that $I_G=I_{G_1}+I_{G_2}$, where both $I_{G_1}$ and $I_{G_2}$ are not equal to $I_G$. We show that $I_G$ is subgraph splittable if and only if it is edge splittable. We also prove that the toric ideal of a complete bipartite graph is not subgraph splittable. In contrast, we show that the toric ideal of a complete graph $K_n$ is always subgraph splittable when $n \geq 4$. Additionally, we show that the toric ideal of $K_n$ has a minimal splitting if and only if $4 \leq n \leq 5$. Finally, we prove that any minimal splitting of $I_G$ is also a reduced splitting.</description>

      <title>The perfectoid Tate algebra has uncountable Krull dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let \(K\) be a perfectoid field with pseudo-uniformizer \(\pi\). We adapt an argument of Du in \cite{DuUncountable} to show that the perfectoid Tate algebra \(K\langle x^{1 / p^{\infty}} \rangle\) has an uncountable chain of distinct prime ideals. First, we conceptualize Du's argument, defining the notion of a \textit{Newton polygon formalism} on a ring. We prove a version of Du's theorem in the prescence of a sufficiently nondiscrete Newton polygon formalism. Then, we apply our framework to the perfectoid Tate algebra via a "nonstandard" Newton polygon formalism (roughly, the roles of the series variable \(x\) and the pseudo-uniformizer \(\pi\) are switched). We conclude a similar statement for multivatiate perfectoid Tate algebras using the one-variable case.</description>
