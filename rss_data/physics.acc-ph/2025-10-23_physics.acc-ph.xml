      <title>Homogenized harmonic balance finite element method for nonlinear eddy current simulations of fast corrector magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a homogenized harmonic balance finite element method (HomHBFEM) to predict the dynamic behavior of magnets with fast excitation cycles, including eddy current and skin effects. A homogenization technique for laminated yokes avoids resolving the individual laminates and the skin depth in the finite element (FE) mesh. Instead, the yoke is represented by a bulk surrogate material with frequency-dependent parameters. The ferromagnetic saturation of the yoke at higher excitation currents is tackled by a harmonic balance method, which accounts for a coupled set of frequency components. Thereby, a computationally expensive time-stepping of the eddy-current field problem and a convolution of the homogenized yoke model are avoided. The HomHBFEM enables, for the first time, to conduct nonlinear simulations of fast corrector magnets, which are embedded in a fast orbit feedback system to counteract orbit disturbances over a broad frequency spectrum, and thus guarantee a stable light-source operation. The results show the impact of the nonlinearity on the phase lag and the field attenuation as well as the eddy current losses at frequencies up to 65 kHz. The numerical validation for a C-dipole magnet example shows that the HomHBFEM achieves a sufficient accuracy at an affordable computational effort, with simulation times of a few hours. In comparison, standard 3D transient FE simulations need to resolve the lamination thickness and the skin depth in space and the largest relevant frequency in time, which leads to a two to three orders of magnitude larger mesh and prohibitive computational effort, with simulation times of a few weeks on a contemporary computer server.</description>

      <title>Master Oscillator and Phase Reference Line Design for the PIP-II Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase averaging reference line system provides the RF phase reference, LO and clock signals to the LLRF and other accelerator sub-systems. The PIP-II linac has RF systems at three frequencies - 162.5 MHz, 325 MHz and 650 MHz. A temperature-stabilized, low-phase-noise oscillator is used as the master oscillator. Phase reference signals at 162.5 MHz, 325 MHz, and 650 MHz, along with LO signals at 182.5 MHz, 345 MHz, 670 MHz and LLRF clocks at 1320 MHz and 1300 MHz, are generated in temperature-controlled RF modules at each frequency section. A phase reference from each module travels to the next section, where it is doubled to produce required frequencies. The reference also travels alongside the accelerating cavities in the tunnel, allowing cavity probe and reference cables to temperature track and reduce measurement errors from temperature changes or phase drift.</description>
