      <title>Towers of Quantum Many-body Scars from Integrable Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct several models with multiple quantum many-body scars (QMBS) using integrable boundary states~(IBS). We focus on the tilted N\'eel states, which are parametrized IBS of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and show that these states can be used to construct a tower of scar states. Our models exhibit periodic revival dynamics, showcasing a characteristic behavior of superpositions of QMBS. Furthermore, the tower of QMBS found in this study possesses a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) structure, indicating that QMBS are equally spaced in energy. This approach can be extended to two-dimensional models, which can be decomposed into an array of one-dimensional models. In this case, the tilted N\'eel states again serve as parent states for multiple scar states. These states demonstrate low entanglement entropy, marking them as exact scar states. Notably, their entanglement entropy adheres to the sub-volume law, further solidifying the nonthermal properties of QMBS. Our results provide novel insights into constructing QMBS using IBS, thereby illuminating the connection between QMBS and integrable models.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal fluctuations in the passive and active Riesz gas on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a periodic Riesz gas consisting of $N$ classical particles on a circle, interacting via a two-body repulsive potential which behaves locally as a power law of the distance, $\sim g/|x|^s$ for $s&gt;-1$. Long range (LR) interactions correspond to $s&lt;1$, short range (SR) interactions to $s&gt;1$, while the cases $s=0$ and $s=2$ describe the well-known log-gas and the Calogero-Moser (CM) model respectively. We study the fluctuations of the positions around the equally spaced crystal configuration, both for Brownian and run-and-tumble particles (RTP). Focusing on the regime of weak noise, we obtain exact expressions for the space-time correlations, both at the macroscopic and microscopic scale, for $N \gg 1$ and at fixed mean density $\rho$. They are characterized by a dynamical exponent $z_s=\min(1+s,2)$. We also obtain the gap statistics, described by a roughness exponent $\zeta_s=\frac{1}{2} \min(s,1)$. For $s&gt;0$ in the Brownian case, we find that in a broad time window, the mean square displacement of a particle is sub-diffusive as $t^{1/2}$ for SR as in single-file diffusion, and $t^{s/(1+s)}$ for LR interactions. Remarkably, this coincides, including the amplitude, with a recent prediction obtained using macroscopic fluctuation theory. These results also apply to RTPs beyond a time-scale $1/\gamma$, with $\gamma$ the tumbling rate, and a characteristic length-scale. Instead, for either shorter times or shorter distances, the active noise leads to a rich variety of static and dynamical regimes, with distinct exponents. For $-1&lt;s&lt;0$, the displacements are bounded, leading to true crystalline order at weak noise. The melting transition, recently observed numerically, is discussed in light of our calculation. Finally, we extend our method to the active Dyson Brownian motion and active CM model in a harmonic trap, generalizing to finite $\gamma$ the results of our earlier work.</description>

      <title>Pseudo Transitions in the Finite-Size Blume-Capel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the pseudo transitions of the Blume-Capel model on two-dimensional finite-size lattices. Using Wang-Landau and Metropolis sampling, we collected relevant data for the system. Through canonical analysis, microcanonical inflection-point analysis, and geometric analysis, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the system from multiple perspectives, yielding consistent and coherent results. Third-order transition signals were identified using two analytical methods, followed by an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms driving these transitions. We speculate that third-order independent transitions may only occur in second-order phase transitions and not in first-order transitions.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been studied that a pair of coupled identical Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models with complex fermions provides globally chaotic systems that allow the quantum mutual information to traverse through the wormhole\cite{Sahoo}, where the robust ergodicity against the localization is supported by the revival oscillations between the two chaotic subsystems\cite{Sahoo,Cao2}. Similarly, a periodic initial state revivals in a many-body system indicate the nonthermal feature in the quench dynamics up to long-time limit (infinite temperature or high energy density)\cite{Choi,Turner,Anza}, which is distinct to the conventional many-body scars. In this article, we focus on the measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in the systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases.</description>

      <title>The non-classical regime of the two-dimensional long-range XY model: a comprehensive Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) universal behaviors remains a fundamental topic in studying long-range interacting systems. The interaction between LR coupling and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism introduces significant complexity, especially in the two-dimensional (2D) XY model, which is crucial for exploring low-dimensional phenomena and their implications for quantum computation. In the paper [arXiv:2404.08498], we investigated the 2D XY model with algebraically decaying interactions of the form $1/r^{2+\sigma}$. Our findings demonstrated continuous phase transitions into a ferromagnetic phase for $\sigma \leq 2$, characterized by the emergence of long-range order. In the ferromagnetic phase, for $\sigma&lt;2$, we identified a power-law decaying correlation function attributed to the Goldstone mode, and for $\sigma=2$, logarithmic behaviors were observed. In this supplemental paper, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the detailed methodology, additional simulation results, and further insights into the above phenomena. It enhances our understanding of the crossover between SR and LR behaviors and has practical implications for experimental systems, such as Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Learning optimal erasure of a Static Random Access Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamic cost associated with erasing a static random access memory. By combining the stochastic thermodynamics framework of electronic circuits with machine learning-based optimization techniques, we show that it is possible to erase an electronic random access memory at arbitrarily fast speed and finite heat dissipation. This disproves a widely held belief that heat dissipation scales linearly with erasure speed. Furthermore, we find driving protocols that minimize the heat dissipation, leading to explicit design principles for future computer memories. This bridges an important gap between the theoretical framework of stochastic thermodynamics and applications in electronic engineering.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Integrability and Non-integrability for Spin-1/2 Chain with Symmetric Nearest-Neighbor Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General spin-1/2 chains with symmetric nearest-neighbor interaction are studied. We rigorously prove that all spin models in this class, except for known integrable systems, are non-integrable in the sense that they possess no nontrivial local conserved quantities. This result confirms that there are no missing integrable systems, i.e., integrable systems in this class are exactly those that are already known. In addition, this result excludes the possibility of intermediate systems which have a finite number of nontrivial local conserved quantities. Our findings support the expectation that integrable systems are exceptional in quantum many-body systems and most systems are non-integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in all spin-1/2 chains with symmetric nearest-neighbor interaction, except for known integrable systems. This result shows that there are no further integrable system that awaits to be discovered. Our finding also implies that there is no intermediate systems with a finite number of nontrivial local conserved quantities. In addition, we clarify all short-support conserved quantities in non-integrable systems, which we need to take into account in analyses of thermalization and level statistics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical simulations of many-body quantum chaos on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits with local unitaries have emerged as a rich playground for the exploration of many-body quantum dynamics of discrete-time systems. While the intrinsic locality makes them particularly suited to run on current quantum processors, the task of verification at non-trivial scales is complicated for non-integrable systems. Here, we study a special class of maximally chaotic circuits known as dual unitary circuits -- exhibiting unitarity in both space and time -- that are known to have exact analytical solutions for certain correlation functions. With advances in noise learning and the implementation of novel error mitigation methods, we show that a superconducting quantum processor with 91 qubits is able to accurately simulate these correlators. We then probe dynamics beyond exact verification, by perturbing the circuits away from the dual unitary point, and compare our results to classical approximations with tensor networks. These results cement error-mitigated digital quantum simulation on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors as a trustworthy platform for the exploration and discovery of novel emergent quantum many-body phases.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spectra from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum of a bipartite quantum system is given by the distribution of eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian. In this work, we compute the entanglement spectrum in the vacuum state for a subregion of a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) admitting a holographic dual. In the case of a spherical (or planar) entangling surface, we recover known results in two dimensions, including the Cardy formula in the high energy regime. In higher dimensions $d&gt;2$, we analytically determine a generalization of the Cardy formula valid at large energies and consistent with previous studies of CFT spectra in the literature. We also investigate numerically the spectrum at energy levels far above the modular ground state energy. We extend our analysis to the supersymmetric point of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, providing exact results when $d=2,3$, and a generalization of the Cardy formula at high energies in generic dimension $d$. We consider small shape deformations of a spherical entangling surface, for both the non-supersymmetric and the supersymmetric cases. In all cases we find that the high-energy scaling of the microcanonical entropy with the modular energy is unaffected by the shape deformation. This result suggests that the high-energy regime of the entanglement spectra carries universal information, independent of the shape of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Dissipation via Interacting Environments: Quadratic Convergence to Landauer Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental limits on thermodynamic irreversibility when cooling a quantum system in the presence of a finite-size reservoir. First, we prove that for any non-interacting $n$-particle reservoir, the entropy production $\Sigma$ decays at most linearly with $n$. Instead, we derive a cooling protocol in which $\Sigma \propto 1/n^2$, which is in fact the best possible scaling. This becomes possible due to the presence of interactions in the finite-size reservoir, which must be prepared at the verge of a phase transition. Our results open the possibility of cooling with a higher energetic efficiency via interacting reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Low-density parity-check codes as stable phases of quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.</description>

      <title>Finite Entanglement Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disorder parameter, which is the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite entanglement scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite entanglement scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., proportional to boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-from symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.</description>

      <title>Rapidly mixing loop representation quantum Monte Carlo for Heisenberg models on star-like bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have proven invaluable in condensed matter physics, particularly for studying ground states and thermal equilibrium properties of quantum Hamiltonians without a sign problem. Over the past decade, significant progress has also been made on their rigorous convergence analysis.
  Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFM) with bipartite interaction graphs are a popular target of computational QMC studies due to their physical importance, but despite the apparent empirical efficiency of these simulations it remains an open question whether efficient classical approximation of the ground energy is possible in general. In this work we introduce a ground state variant of the stochastic series expansion QMC method, and for the special class of AFM on interaction graphs with an $O(1)$-bipartite component (star-like), we prove rapid mixing of the associated QMC Markov chain (polynomial time in the number of qubits) by using Jerrum and Sinclair's method of canonical paths. This is the first Markov chain analysis of a practical class of QMC algorithms with the loop representation of Heisenberg models.
  Our findings contribute to the broader effort to resolve the computational complexity of Heisenberg AFM on general bipartite interaction graphs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Exact Replica Symmetric solution for transverse field Hopfield model under finite Trotter size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum Hopfield model in which an extensive number of patterns are embedded in the presence of a uniform transverse field. This analysis employs the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz on the Suzuki-Trotter representation of the model, while keeping the number of Trotter slices $M$ finite. The statistical properties of the quantum Hopfield model in imaginary time are reduced to an effective $M$-spin long-range classical Ising model, which can be extensively studied using a dedicated Monte Carlo algorithm. This approach contrasts with the commonly applied static approximation, which ignores the imaginary time dependency of the order parameters, but allows $M \to \infty$ to be taken analytically. During the analysis, we introduce an exact but fundamentally weaker static relation, referred to as the quasi-static relation. We present the phase diagram of the model with respect to the transverse field strength and the number of embedded patterns, indicating a small but quantitative difference from previous results obtained using the static approximation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimensions $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law in interacting bosons: from Bose-Hubbard, $\phi$4, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement area law is a universal principle that characterizes the information structure in quantum many-body systems and serves as the foundation for modern algorithms based on tensor network representations. Historically, the area law has been well understood under two critical assumptions: short-range interactions and bounded local energy. However, extending the area law beyond these assumptions has been a long-sought goal in quantum many-body theory. This challenge is especially pronounced in interacting boson systems, where the breakdown of the bounded energy assumption is universal and poses significant difficulties. In this work, we prove the area law for one-dimensional interacting boson systems including the long-range interactions. Our model encompasses the Bose-Hubbard class and the $\phi4$ class, two of the most fundamental models in quantum condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. This result achieves the resolution of the area law that incorporates both the challenges of unbounded local energy and long-range interactions in a unified manner. Additionally, we establish an efficiency-guaranteed approximation of the quantum ground states using Matrix Product States (MPS). These results significantly advance our understanding of quantum complexity by offering new insights into how bosonic parameters and interaction decay rates influence entanglement. Our findings provide crucial theoretical foundations for simulating long-range interacting cold atomic systems, which are central to modern quantum technologies, and pave the way for more efficient simulation techniques in future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling and dynamics in a two-dimensional lattice of identical oscillators with frustrated couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional lattice of oscillators with identical (zero) intrinsic frequencies and Kuramoto type of interactions with randomly frustrated couplings is considered. Starting the time evolution from slightly perturbed synchronized states, we study numerically the relaxation properties, as well as properties at the stable fixed point which can also be viewed as a metastable state of the closely related XY spin glass model. According to our results, the order parameter at the stable fixed point shows generally a slow, reciprocal logarithmic convergence to its limiting value with the system size. The infinite-size limit is found to be close to zero for zero-centered Gaussian couplings, whereas, for a binary $\pm 1$ distribution with a sufficiently high concentration of positive couplings, it is significantly above zero. Besides, the relaxation time is found to grow algebraically with the system size. Thus, the order parameter in an infinite system approaches its limiting value inversely proportionally to $\ln t$ at late times $t$, similarly to that found in the model with all-to-all couplings [Daido, Chaos {\bf 28}, 045102 (2018)]. As opposed to the order parameter, the energy of the corresponding XY model is found to converge algebraically to its infinite-size limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory plasma production almost always preferentially heats either the ions or electrons, leading to a two-temperature state. High-fidelity modeling of these systems can be achieved with density functional theory molecular dynamics in the two-temperature, adiabatic electron limit. Motivated by this, we construct a statistical mechanics framework for the multi-temperature system that is theoretically consistent with the ab initio calculation. We proceed to derive multi-temperature quantum Ornstein-Zernike equations for the first time. We then construct a two-temperature two-component plasma model using the average atom and compute the radial distribution function, viscosity, ion thermal conductivity, and ion self-diffusion. We verify that we recover the ionic structure and self-diffusion of density functional molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>LDPC stabilizer codes as gapped quantum phases: stability under graph-local perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the proof of stability of topological order, due to Bravyi, Hastings and Michalakis, to stabilizer Hamiltonians corresponding to low-density parity check (LDPC) codes without the restriction of geometric locality in Euclidean space. We consider Hamiltonians $H_0$ defined by $[[N,K,d]]$ LDPC codes which obey certain topological quantum order conditions: (i) code distance $d \geq c \log(N)$, implying local indistinguishability of ground states, and (ii) a mild condition on local and global compatibility of ground states; these include good quantum LDPC codes, and the toric code on a hyperbolic lattice, among others. We consider stability under weak perturbations that are quasi-local on the interaction graph defined by $H_0$, and which can be represented as sums of bounded-norm terms. As long as the local perturbation strength is smaller than a finite constant, we show that the perturbed Hamiltonian has well-defined spectral bands originating from the $O(1)$ smallest eigenvalues of $H_0$. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue has $2^K$ states, is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a finite energy gap, and has exponentially narrow bandwidth $\delta = C N e^{-\Theta(d)}$, which is tighter than the best known bounds even in the Euclidean case. We also obtain that the new ground state subspace is related to the initial code subspace by a quasi-local unitary, allowing one to relate their physical properties. Our proof uses an iterative procedure that performs successive rotations to eliminate non-frustration-free terms in the Hamiltonian. Our results extend to quantum Hamiltonians built from classical LDPC codes, which give rise to stable symmetry-breaking phases. These results show that LDPC codes very generally define stable gapped quantum phases, even in the non-Euclidean setting, initiating a systematic study of such phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Continuum Limit of Dendritic Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum models are commonly used to study dendritic deposition in fields ranging from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to battery research. However, the continuum approximation underlying these models is poorly understood, even in the simplified case of Brownian particles depositing onto a small, reactive cluster. Specifically, this system transitions from a compact to a dendritic morphology at a critical radius that depends on the particle size. But in simulations of the continuum (small-particle) limit, the critical radius does not reproduce the scaling predicted by a purely continuum analysis. This discrepancy suggests that continuum models cannot capture the microscopic physics of dendrite formation, raising doubts about their experimental relevance. To clarify the continuum limit of dendritic deposition, here, we reexamine the critical radius scaling of the Brownian particle system using Brownian dynamics simulations. Compared to past studies, we probe larger system sizes, up to hundreds of millions of particles in some cases, and adopt an improved paradigm for the surface reaction. This paradigm allows us to converge our simulations and to work with well-defined physical parameters. Our results show that the critical radius scaling is, in fact, consistent with the continuum analysis, validating the continuum approach to modeling dendritic deposition. Nonetheless, the Brownian particle system converges to its continuum limit slowly. As a result, when applying continuum models to more complex deposition processes, the continuum approximation itself may be a significant source of error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that the reason why many properties of water are notoriously at odds with current models is the low dissociation energy of the H-bond, which leads to the instability of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Bose-Einstein condensation at the gas-liquid transition stabilizes the H-bond and opens the door to a reasoning from the laws of quantum mechanics to classical physics, explaining the properties of the condensed phases with only four observables and no arbitrary hypotheses. The isomorphic structures are composed of honeycomb sheets. Heat transfer reveals the eigenstates that determine the temperatures of the phase transitions. Quantum entanglement and degeneracy explain the heat capacities and latent heats. The supercooled liquid is a superposition of the high and low density eigenstates. Bose-Einstein condensation also explains the honeycomb pattern of an aerosol of droplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a top-down approach to theoretically model the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of active disks and use this model to derive the effective dynamics of a single particle. By analyzing clustering dynamics in simulations, we introduce a local density variable that captures interaction effects. We numerically calculate the mean and temporal auto-correlation of local density in the steady state, and use these to analytically derive an exact expression for a particle's diffusivity as a function of global packing density. Remarkably, our effective model closely matches numerical diffusivity in high packing density regime where prominent clusters are formed and shows striking agreements with the well-known existence of phase transition beyond a critical packing density. This model could be useful in experimental setups where fluctuations in local density around a tagged particle are measurable.</description>

Abstract: We review the description of the Johnson noise as a particular case of Brownian motion and compare it with Nyquist's description. Motivated by the analysis of a simple circuit with two resistors, we hypothesize that the electric field that generates the Johnson noise originates from all the conducting material that makes up the circuit. We build a workable one dimensional model for a gas of particles that undergo stochastic collisions with the lattice and distance-dependent inter-particle interaction. Simulations with this model predict that in the case of a circuit with nonuniform temperature, the strength of the Johnson noise at a segment of the circuit is influenced by the temperature at other parts of the circuit in an essentially non-local way.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact solution for one-dimensional overdamped dynamics near a hard wall, allowing us to connect steady-state distributions under confinement with the extreme value statistics of unconfined stochastic processes. This mapping holds regardless of the statistics of the noise driving the dynamics. We first apply this result within Brownian motion theory, deriving the noncrossing probability of a Brownian path with a specific family of curves, from which several well-known results in the field can be recovered in a unified way. We then extend the analysis to non-Markovian processes, using the mapping to a steady-state to compute the long-time noncrossing probability of a pair of run-and-tumble and Brownian particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12197v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic tradeoff relations quantify the fundamental concept of ``no free lunch'' in the physical world, suggesting that faster and more precise physical processes come at a higher thermodynamic cost. The key elements in these tradeoff relations are the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and speed limit, which are closely tied to information inequalities from which other tradeoff relations are derived. Concentration inequalities are relations that complement information inequalities in statistical analyses and have been widely used in various fields. However, their role in thermodynamic tradeoff relations remains unclear. This Letter develops thermodynamic concentration inequalities that provide bounds for the distribution of observables in quantum and classical Markov processes. We derive a set of tradeoff relations that generalize speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations from the developed thermodynamic concentration inequalities. The derived tradeoff relations hold under minimal assumptions of the underlying physical processes. This Letter clarifies the role of concentration inequalities in thermodynamics, paving the way for deriving new tradeoff relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and thermalization of the Fredkin spin chain, a system with local three-body interactions, particle conservation and explicit kinetic constraints. We consider deformations away from its stochastic point in order to tune between regimes where kinetic energy dominates and those where potential energy does. By means of exact diagonalisation, perturbation theory and variational matrix product states, we show there is a sudden change of behaviour in the dynamics that occurs, from one of fast thermalization to one of slow metastable (prethermal) dynamics near the stochastic point. This change in relaxation is connected to the emergence of additional kinetic constraints which lead to the fragmentation of Hilbert space in the limit of a large potential energy. We also show that this change can lead to thermalization being evaded for special initial conditions due to non-thermal eigenstates (akin to quantum many-body scars). We provide clear evidence for the existence of these non-thermal states for large system sizes even when far from the large-potential-energy limit, and explain their connection to the emergent kinetic constraints.</description>

      <title>Weighted average temperature as the effective temperature of a system in contact with two thermal baths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effective temperature of a harmonic chain whose two ends are coupled to two baths at different temperatures. We propose to take the weighted average temperature as the effective temperature of the system. The weight factors are related to the couplings between the system and two baths as well as the asymmetry of interactions between oscillators. We revisit the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium steady states based on the weighted average temperature. It is found that the fundamental thermodynamic relations in nonequilibrium steady states possess similar concise forms as those in equilibrium thermodynamics, provided that we replace the temperature in equilibrium with the weighted average temperature in steady states. We also illustrate the procedure to explicitly calculate the effective temperatures via three examples.</description>

      <title>Negative large deviations of the front velocity of $N$-particle branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study negative large deviations of the long-time empirical front velocity of the center of mass of the one-sided $N$-BBM ($N$-particle branching Brownian motion) system in one dimension. Employing the macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study the probability that $c$ is smaller than the limiting front velocity $c_0$, predicted by the deterministic theory, or even becomes negative. To this end we determine the optimal path of the system, conditioned on the specified $c$. We show that for $c_0-c\ll c_0$ the properly defined rate function $s(c)$, coincides, up to a non-universal numerical factor, with the universal rate functions for front models belonging to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov universality class. For sufficiently large negative values of $c$, $s(c)$ approaches a simple bound, obtained under the assumption that the branching is completely suppressed during the whole time. Remarkably, for all $c\leq c_*$, where $c=c_*&lt;0$ is a critical value that we find numerically, the rate function $s(c)$ is \emph{equal} to the simple bound. At the critical point $c=c_*$ the character of the optimal path changes, and the rate function exhibits a dynamical phase transition of second order.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>

      <title>Experimental confirmation of breach of the basic postulate of Statistical Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the course of computer modeling of the most probable stationary macrostates of non-ergodic closed systems, a forecast was obtained about the existence of limits of applicability of the basic axiomatic postulate of statistical physics, known as the Principle of Equiprobability of each realizable microstate. Moreover, for such systems, thermodynamic equilibrium is no longer the only permissible stationary state. The possibility of other most probable macrostates is predicted, which are characterized by the presence of a stable anisotropy of the polarization parameters of thermal radiation filling these systems. The article presents successful results of direct experimental verification of the above prognosis on a real physical installation. Important regularities inherent in the used mathematical model are noted.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of the additional third-order transitions in the two-dimensional Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the canonical ensemble framework, this paper investigates the presence of higher-order transition signals in the q-state Potts model (for q&gt;3), using two geometric order parameters: isolated spins number and the average perimeter of clusters. Our results confirm that higher-order transitions exist in the Potts model, where the number of isolated spins reliably indicates third-order independent transitions. This signal persists regardless of the system's phase transition order, even at higher values of q. In contrast, the average perimeter of clusters, used as an order parameter for detecting third-order dependent transitions, shows that for q = 6 and q = 8, the signal for third-order dependent transitions disappears, indicating its absence in systems undergoing first-order transitions. These findings are consistent with results from microcanonical inflection-point analysis, further validating the robustness of this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set out to explore the possibility of investigating the critical behavior of systems with first-order phase transition using deep machine learning. We propose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of instantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy and ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether a given sample belong to one or the other phase of matter. This allows us to estimate the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, mixed phase and, disordered phase. From these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and the latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also find that the probabilities can reflect geometric transitions in the mixed phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain. Following our recently developed analytical theory for the athermal limit, here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to under-constrained systems at finite temperatures. Close to the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles the partition sum for a broad class of under-constrained systems, from which we obtain analytic expressions for elastic material properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ in terms of isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, shear strain $\gamma$, and temperature $T$. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain. We provide analytical expressions for these parameters based on the microscopic structure of the system. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain, which is theoretically well understood. Here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to finite temperatures for a very broad class of under-constrained systems. In the vicinity of the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles expressions for elastic properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ on temperature $T$, isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, and shear strain $\gamma$, which we confirm numerically. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain, which can be determined from the microstructure of the system. Our results imply that in under-constrained systems, entropic and energetic rigidity interact like two springs in series. This also allows for a simple explanation of the previously numerically observed scaling relation $t\sim G\sim T^{1/2}$ at $\varepsilon=\gamma=0$. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations for quantum systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians play a crucial role in describing open quantum systems and nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we derive trade-off relations for systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, focusing on the Margolus-Levitin-type and Mandelstam-Tamm-type bounds, which are originally derived as quantum speed limits in isolated quantum dynamics. While the quantum speed limit for the Mandelstam-Tamm bound in general non-Hermitian systems was derived in the literature, we obtain a Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit for continuous measurement using the continuous matrix product state formalism. Moreover, we derive a Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit in the non-Hermitian setting. We derive additional bounds on the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of an observable, which take the same form as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. As an example, we apply these bounds to the continuous measurement formalism in open quantum dynamics, where the dynamics is described by discontinuous jumps and smooth evolution induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our work provides a unified perspective on the quantum speed limit and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in open quantum dynamics from the viewpoint of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, extending the results of previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realism about quantum theory naturally leads to realism about the quantum state of the universe. It leaves open whether it is a pure state represented by a wave function, or an impure (mixed) one represented by a density matrix. I characterize and elaborate on Density Matrix Realism, the thesis that the universal quantum state is objective but can be impure. To clarify the thesis, I compare it with Wave Function Realism, explain the conditions under which they are empirically equivalent, consider two generalizations of Density Matrix Realism, and answer some frequently asked questions. I end by highlighting an implication for scientific realism.</description>

Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Collective motion from quantum entanglement in visual perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent development in purely perception based models of collective motion using perception vectors, we suggest a quantum-inspired model of collective behaviour. We investigate the alignment of self-propelled agents by introducing quantum entanglement in the perceptual states of neighboring agents within each agent's vision cone. In this framework, we propose that the force acting on active agents is proportional to the quantum expectation value of perception operator encoding perceptual dynamics that drives alignment within the flock. Additionally, we introduce two quantum mechanical measures-perception strength and perceptual energy-to characterize collective behavior. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of the entangled state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into swarm intelligence and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from entangled perceptual states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spin-1 version of the random energy model with crystal field. Crystal field controls the density of 0 spins in the system. We solve the model in the micro-canonincal ensemble. The model has a spin-glass transition at a finite temperature for all strengths of the crystal field. By introducing the magnetic field we also obtain the de Almeida Thouless line for the model. The spin-glass transition persists in the presence of external field. We also find that the magnetisation shows non-monotonic behaviour for high positive crystal field strengths. The zero magnetic field specific heat and magnetic susceptibility also exhibit a cusp beyond a threshold value of the crystal field.</description>
