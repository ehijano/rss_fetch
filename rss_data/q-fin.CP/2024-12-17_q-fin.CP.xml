      <title>From Votes to Volatility Predicting the Stock Market on Election Day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock market forecasting has been a topic of extensive research, aiming to provide investors with optimal stock recommendations for higher returns. In recent years, this field has gained even more attention due to the widespread adoption of deep learning models. While these models have achieved impressive accuracy in predicting stock behavior, tailoring them to specific scenarios has become increasingly important. Election Day represents one such critical scenario, characterized by intensified market volatility, as the winning candidate's policies significantly impact various economic sectors and companies. To address this challenge, we propose the Election Day Stock Market Forecasting (EDSMF) Model. Our approach leverages the contextual capabilities of large language models alongside specialized agents designed to analyze the political and economic consequences of elections. By building on a state-of-the-art architecture, we demonstrate that EDSMF improves the predictive performance of the S&amp;P 500 during this uniquely volatile day.</description>

      <title>S&amp;P 500 Trend Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project aims to predict short-term and long-term upward trends in the S&amp;P 500 index using machine learning models and feature engineering based on the "101 Formulaic Alphas" methodology. The study employed multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost, to identify market trends from historical stock data collected from Yahoo! Finance. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, standardization, and iterative feature selection to ensure relevance and variability.
  For short-term predictions, KNN emerged as the most effective model, delivering robust performance with high recall for upward trends, while for long-term forecasts, XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy and AUC scores after hyperparameter tuning and class imbalance adjustments using SMOTE. Feature importance analysis highlighted the dominance of momentum-based and volume-related indicators in driving predictions. However, models exhibited limitations such as overfitting and low recall for positive market movements, particularly in imbalanced datasets.
  The study concludes that KNN is ideal for short-term alerts, whereas XGBoost is better suited for long-term trend forecasting. Future enhancements could include advanced architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and further feature refinement to improve precision and generalizability. These findings contribute to developing reliable machine learning tools for market trend prediction and investment decision-making.</description>

      <title>FinGPT: Enhancing Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Prediction with Dissemination-Aware and Context-Enriched LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of news on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities. However, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its dissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements. Additionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and explicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret news. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances LLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news dissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster recent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching prompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to construct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting short-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our approach improves prediction accuracy by 8\% compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>SusGen-GPT: A Data-Centric LLM for Financial NLP and Sustainability Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the financial sector and the rising focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations highlight the need for advanced NLP tools. However, open-source LLMs proficient in both finance and ESG domains remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce SusGen-30K, a category-balanced dataset comprising seven financial NLP tasks and ESG report generation, and propose TCFD-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating sustainability report generation. Leveraging this dataset, we developed SusGen-GPT, a suite of models achieving state-of-the-art performance across six adapted and two off-the-shelf tasks, trailing GPT-4 by only 2% despite using 7-8B parameters compared to GPT-4's 1,700B. Based on this, we propose the SusGen system, integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to assist in sustainability report generation. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our approach, advancing research in finance and ESG.</description>

      <title>Simulation of square-root processes made simple: applications to the Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, efficient and accurate nonnegative preserving numerical scheme for simulating the square-root process. The novel idea is to simulate the integrated square-root process first instead of the square-root process itself. Numerical experiments on realistic parameter sets, applied for the integrated process and the Heston model, display high precision with a very low number of time steps. As a bonus, our scheme yields the exact limiting Inverse Gaussian distributions of the integrated square-root process with only one single time-step in two scenarios: (i) for high mean-reversion and volatility-of-volatility regimes, regardless of maturity; and (ii) for long maturities, independent of the other parameters.</description>

      <title>Joint SPX-VIX calibration with Gaussian polynomial volatility models: deep pricing with quantization hints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the joint SPX-VIX calibration within a general class of Gaussian polynomial volatility models in which the volatility of the SPX is assumed to be a polynomial function of a Gaussian Volterra process defined as a stochastic convolution between a kernel and a Brownian motion. By performing joint calibration to daily SPX-VIX implied volatility surface data between 2012 and 2022, we compare the empirical performance of different kernels and their associated Markovian and non-Markovian models, such as rough and non-rough path-dependent volatility models. In order to ensure an efficient calibration and a fair comparison between the models, we develop a generic unified method in our class of models for fast and accurate pricing of SPX and VIX derivatives based on functional quantization and Neural Networks. For the first time, we identify a \textit{conventional one-factor Markovian continuous stochastic volatility model} that is able to achieve remarkable fits of the implied volatility surfaces of the SPX and VIX together with the term structure of VIX futures. What is even more remarkable is that our conventional one-factor Markovian continuous stochastic volatility model outperforms, in all market conditions, its rough and
  non-rough path-dependent counterparts with the same number of parameters.</description>
