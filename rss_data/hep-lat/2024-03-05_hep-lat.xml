      <title>Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and mass gap of QCD in finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the lattice QCD simulation with the 2+1+1 flavor full QCD ensembles using near-physical quark masses and different spatial sizes $L$, at $a\sim$ 0.055 fm. The results suggest that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is effectively restored at $L\le 1.0$ fm, while the gap between the nucleon and pion masses remains.</description>

      <title>Identify the new state $Y(3872)$ as the P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently observed a new charmonium-like vector state $Y(3872)$ in $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}$, which should be the first P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ molecular resonance. The experimental and theoretical identification of the P-wave dimeson state holds paramount importance in enhancing our comprehension of the non-perturbative QCD and few-body physics. Its existence is firmly established in a unified meson-exchange model which simultaneously depicts the features of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. This scenario can be directly examined in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ cross section to see whether a resonance exists at the threshold. The credibility of the investigations is also ensured by the fact that the P-wave interaction dominantly arises from the well-known long-range pion exchange. Additionally, the existence of the P-wave resonance only depends on the interaction strength and is less sensitive to the potential shapes. We extensively calculate all systems up to P-wave with various quantum numbers and predict a dense population of the $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ and $DD^*$ states, where the S-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G (J^{PC})=0^- (1^{+-})$, P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$, and P-wave $DD^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(0^-)$ are more likely to be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential $\mu_\text{B}$. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential. Using this approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold and dense quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo for Gauge Fields and Matter without the Fermion Determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab-initio Monte Carlo simulations of strongly-interacting fermionic systems are plagued by the fermion sign problem, making the non-perturbative study of many interesting regimes of dense quantum matter, or of theories of odd numbers of fermion flavors, challenging. Moreover, typical fermion algorithms require the computation (or sampling) of the fermion determinant. We focus instead on the meron cluster algorithm, which can solve the fermion sign problem in a class of models without involving the determinant. We develop and benchmark new meron algorithms to simulate fermions coupled to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ gauge fields in the presence of appropriate four-fermi interactions. Such algorithms can be used to uncover potential exotic properties of matter, particularly relevant for quantum simulator experiments. We demonstrate the emergence of the Gauss' Law at low temperatures for a $U(1)$ model in $(1+1)-$d.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm effect for confined matter in lattice gauge theories</title>

Abstract: Gauge theories arise in physical systems displaying space-time local symmetries. They provide a powerful description of important realms of physics ranging from fundamental interactions, to statistical mechanics, condensed matter and more recently quantum computation. As such, a remarkably deep understanding has been achieved in the field. With the advent of quantum technology, lower energy analogs, capable to capture important features of the original quantum field theories through quantum simulation, have been intensively studied. Here, we propose a specific scheme implementing an analogic quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories constrained to mesoscopic spatial scales. To this end, we study the dynamics of mesons residing in a ring-shaped lattice of mesoscopic size pierced by an effective magnetic field. In particular, we find a new type of Aharonov-Bohm effect that goes beyond the particle-like effect and reflecting the the features of the confining gauge potential. The coherence properties of the meson are quantified by the persistent current and by specific features of the correlation functions. When the magnetic field is quenched, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and correlations start a specific matter-wave current dynamics.</description>

      <title>On thermal transition in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe how the general mechanism of partial deconfinement applies to large-$N$ QCD and the partially-deconfined phase inevitably appears between completely-confined and completely-deconfined phases. Furthermore, we propose how the partial deconfinement can be observed in the real-world QCD with the SU(3) gauge group. For this purpose, we employ lattice configurations obtained by the WHOT-QCD collaboration and examine our proposal numerically. In the discussion, the Polyakov loop plays a crucial role in characterizing the phases, without relying on center symmetry, and hence, we clarify the meaning of the Polyakov loop in QCD at large $N$ and finite $N$.
  Both at large $N$ and finite $N$, the complete confinement is characterized by the Haar-random distribution of the Polyakov line phases. Haar-randomness, which is stronger than unbroken center symmetry, indicates that Polyakov loops in any nontrivial representations have vanishing expectation values and deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures is quantified with the loops. We discuss that the transitions separating the partially-deconfined phase are characterized by the behaviors of Polyakov loops in various representations. The lattice QCD data provide us with the signals exhibiting two different characteristic temperatures: deconfinement of the fundamental representation and deconfinement of higher representations. As a nontrivial test for our proposal, we also investigate the relation between partial deconfinement and instanton condensation and confirm the consistency with the lattice data.
  To make the presentation more easily accessible, we provide a detailed review of the previously known aspects of partial deconfinement.</description>

      <title>Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing the inverse moment of $B_s$-meson distribution amplitude via $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), denoted as $\lambda_{B_s}$ and defined within the heavy quark effective theory, through the calculation of $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors. The presence of the $s$-quark inside the $B_s$-meson dictates a notable departure of approximately $20\%$ in the $\lambda_{B_s}$ value compared to the non-strange case $\lambda_{B_q}$, as computed within the QCD sum rule approach, albeit with significant uncertainty. First, we compute the decay constant of the $\eta_s$-meson utilizing two-point sum rules while retaining finite $s$-quark mass contributions. Next, we constrain the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}$ by calculating $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors within the light-cone sum rule approach, using $B_s$-meson LCDAs, and leveraging Lattice QCD estimates at zero momentum transfer from the HPQCD collaboration. Our findings yield $\lambda_{B_s}$ = 480 $\pm$ 92 MeV when expressing the $B_s$-meson LCDAs in the Exponential model, consistent with previous QCD sum rule estimate yet exhibiting a 1.5-fold improvement in uncertainty. Furthermore, we compare the form factor predictions, based on the extracted $\lambda_{B_s}$ value, with earlier analyses for other channels such as $B_s \to D_s$ and $B_s \to K$.</description>
