      <title>Oscillating and nonsummable Radon-Nikodym cocycles along the forward geodesic of measure-class-preserving transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the least-deletion map on the Cantor space, namely the map that changes the first 1 in a binary sequence to 0, and construct product measures on $2^\mathbb{N}$ so that the corresponding Radon-Nikodym cocycles oscillate or converge to zero nonsummably along the forward geodesic of the map. These examples answer two questions of Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob. We analyze the oscillating example in terms of random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, using the Chung-Fuchs theorem.</description>

      <title>Univalent Foundations of Constructive Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two constructive approaches to defining quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes (qcqs-schemes), namely qcqs-schemes as locally ringed lattices and as functors from rings to sets. We work in Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, but reason informally. The main result is a constructive and univalent proof that the two definitions coincide, giving an equivalence between the respective categories of qcqs-schemes.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey degrees, compactness and approximability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both "direct" and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both "direct" and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for "loose colorings" of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>

      <title>The Lattice Problem for Models of $\mathsf{PA}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lattice problem for models of Peano Arithmetic ($\mathsf{PA}$) is to determine which lattices can be represented as lattices of elementary submodels of a model of $\mathsf{PA}$, or, in greater generality, for a given model $\mathcal{M}$, which lattices can be represented as interstructure lattices of elementary submodels $\mathcal{K}$ of an elementary extension $\mathcal{N}$ such that $\mathcal{M} \preccurlyeq \mathcal{K} \preccurlyeq \mathcal{N}$. The problem has been studied for the last 60 years and the results and their proofs show an interesting interplay between the model theory of PA, Ramsey style combinatorics, lattice representation theory, and elementary number theory. We present a survey of the most important results together with a detailed analysis of some special cases to explain and motivate a technique developed by James Schmerl for constructing elementary extensions with prescribed interstructure lattices. The last section is devoted to a discussion of lesser-known results about lattices of elementary submodels of countable recursively saturated models of PA.</description>

      <title>Modal definability in Kripke's theory of truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Outline of a Theory of Truth, Kripke introduces some of the central concepts of the logical study of truth and paradox. He informally defines some of these -- such as groundedness and paradoxicality -- using modal locutions. We introduce a modal language for regimenting these informal definitions. Though groundedness and paradoxicality are expressible in the modal language, we prove that intrinsicality -- which Kripke emphasizes but does not define modally -- is not. We characterize the modally definable relations and completely axiomatize the modal semantics.</description>

      <title>Partially-elementary end extensions of countable models of set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{KP}$ denote Kripke-Platek Set Theory and let $\mathsf{M}$ be the weak set theory obtained from $\mathsf{ZF}$ by removing the collection scheme, restricting separation to $\Delta_0$-formulae and adding an axiom asserting that every set is contained in a transitive set ($\mathsf{TCo}$). A result due to Kaufmann shows that every countable model, $\mathcal{M}$, of $\mathsf{KP}+\Pi_n\textsf{-Collection}$ has a proper $\Sigma_{n+1}$-elementary end extension. Here we show that there are limits to the amount of the theory of $\mathcal{M}$ that can be transferred to the end extensions that are guaranteed by Kaufmann's Theorem. Using admissible covers and the Barwise Compactness Theorem, we show that if $\mathcal{M}$ is a countable model $\mathsf{KP}+\Pi_n\textsf{-Collection}+\Sigma_{n+1}\textsf{-Foundation}$ and $T$ is a recursive theory that holds in $\mathcal{M}$, then there exists a proper $\Sigma_n$-elementary end extension of $\mathcal{M}$ that satisfies $T$. We use this result to show that the theory $\mathsf{M}+\Pi_n\textsf{-Collection}+\Pi_{n+1}\textsf{-Foundation}$ proves $\Sigma_{n+1}\textsf{-Separation}$.</description>
