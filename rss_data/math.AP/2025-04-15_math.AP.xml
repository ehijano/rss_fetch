      <title>Channels of Energy for the Linearized Energy Critical Wave Equation in Even Dimensions $N\geq 8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an exterior energy estimate for the linearized energy critical wave equation around a multisoliton for even dimensions $N\geq 8.$ This extends previous work of Collot-Duyckaerts-Kenig-Merle to higher dimensions. During the proof we encounter various additional important technical difficulties compared to lower dimensions. In particular, we need to deal with a number of generalized eigenfunctions of the static operator which increases linearly in $N.$ This makes the analysis of projections onto these eigenfunctions a higher dimensional problem, which requires linear systems to control. This is a crucial ingredient in our upcoming work where we give an alternative proof of the soliton resolution for the wave maps equation based on the method of channels of energy developed by Duyckaerts-Kenig-Merle.</description>

      <title>Stable Determination and Reconstruction of a Quasilinear Term in an Elliptic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the inverse problem of determining a quasilinear term appearing in a nonlinear elliptic equation from the measurement of the conormal derivative on the boundary. This problem arises in several practical applications, e.g., heat conduction. We derive novel H\"older stability estimates for both multi- and one-dimensional cases: in the multi-dimensional case, the stability estimates are stated with one single boundary measurement, whereas in the one-dimensional case, due to dimensionality limitation, the stability results are stated for the Dirichlet boundary condition varying in a space of dimension one. We derive these estimates using different properties of solution representations. We complement the theoretical results with numerical reconstructions of the quasilinear term, which illustrate the stable recovery of the quasilinear term in the presence of data noise.</description>

      <title>On Cauchy problem to the modified Camassa-Holm equation: Painlev\'{e} asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Painlev\'{e} asymptotics for the Cauchy problem of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with zero boundary conditions \begin{align*}\nonumber &amp;m_t+\left((u^2-u_x^2)m\right)_x=0, \ (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+,\\ &amp;u(x,0)=u_0(x), \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} u_0(x)=0, \end{align*} where $u_0(x)\in H^{4,2}(\mathbb{R})$. Recently, Yang and Fan (Adv. Math. 402, 108340 (2022)) reported the long-time asymptotic result for the mCH equation in the solitonic regions. The main purpose of our work is to study the long-time asymptotic behavior in two transition regions. The key to proving this result is to establish and analyze the Riemann-Hilbert problem on a new plane $(y;t)$ related to the Cauchy problem of the mCH equation. With the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method and double scaling limit technique, in two transition regions defined by \begin{align}\nonumber \mathcal{P}_{I}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant |\frac{x}{t}-2|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\},~~~~\mathcal{P}_{II}:=\{(x,t):0\leqslant |\frac{x}{t}+1/4|t^{2/3}\leqslant C\}, \end{align} where $C&gt;0$ is a constant, we find that the leading order approximation to the solution of the mCH equation can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\'{e} II equation.</description>

      <title>Trudinger-Moser type inequalities for the Hessian equation with logarithmic weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp Trudinger-Moser inequalities with logarithmic weights for the $k$-Hessian equation and investigate the existence of maximizers. Our analysis extends the classical results of Tian and Wang to $k$-admissible function spaces with logarithmic weights, providing a natural complement to the work of Calanchi and Ruf. Our approach relies on transforming the problem into a one-dimensional weighted Sobolev space, where we solve it using various techniques, including some radial lemmas and certain Hardy-type inequalities, which we establish in this paper, as well as a theorem due to Leckband.</description>

      <title>Global results for weakly dispersive KP-II equations on the cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dispersion-generalized KP-II equation on a partially periodic domain in the weakly dispersive regime. We use Fourier decoupling techniques to derive essentially sharp Strichartz estimates. With these at hand, we show global well-posedness of the quasilinear Cauchy problem in $L^2(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T})$. Finally, we prove a long-time decay property of solutions with small mass by using the Kato smoothing effect in the fractional case.</description>

      <title>Local Phase Tracking and Metastability of Planar Waves in Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar travelling waves on $\mathbb R^d,$ with $ d\geq 2,$ are shown to persist in systems of reaction-diffusion equations with multiplicative noise on significantly long timescales with high probability, provided that the wave is orbitally stable in dimension one ($d=1$). While a global phase tracking mechanism is required to determine the location of the stochastically perturbed wave in one dimension, or on a cylindrical domain, we show that the travelling wave on the full unbounded space can be controlled by keeping track of local deviations only. In particular, the energy infinitesimally added to or withdrawn from the system by noise dissipates almost fully into the transverse direction, leaving behind small localised phase shifts. The noise process considered is white in time and coloured in space, possibly weighted, and either translation invariant or trace class.</description>

      <title>Continuous Revival of the Periodic Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with Piecewise $C^2$ Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the revivals of the one-dimensional periodic Schr\"odinger equation with a piecewise $C^2$ potential function. As has been observed through numerical simulations of the equation with various initial data and potential functions, the solution, while remaining fractalized at irrational times, exhibits a form of revival at rational times. The goal is to prove that the solution at these rational times is given by a finite linear combination of translations and dilations of the initial datum, plus an additional continuous term, which we call "continuous revival". In pursuit of this result, we present a review of relevant properties of the periodic Schr\"odinger equation as an eigenvalue problem, including asymptotic results on both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Some new Liouville type theorems for 3D steady tropical climate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Liouville type theorems for the stationary tropical climate model in three dimension. With the help of the delicate estimates of several integrals and an iteration argument, we establish Liouville type theorems under seventeen different assumptions. As a consequence, we show that a smooth solution is trivial provided that they belong to some Lebesgue spaces or satisfy some decay conditions at infinity. Our results extend and improve the recent work of Cho-In-Yang (2024 Appl. Math. Lett. 153 109039).</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Kuramoto Model: from Many-Particle Liouville Equation to Diffusive Mean-Field Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the mean-field optimal control problem of a swarm of Kuramoto oscillators. The controls exploit the self-synchronization property of the oscillators to achieve target density and target phase coherence. In the limit of an infinite number of oscillators the collective dynamics of the agents' density is described by a diffusive mean-field model in the form of a non-local PDE, where the non-locality arises from the synchronization mechanism. We prove the existence of the optimal control of the mean-field model by using $\Gamma$-convergence strategy of the cost functional corresponding to the Liouville equation on the particle level. In the discussion of propagation of chaos for fixed control functions we complete the relative entropy estimate by using large deviation estimate given by \cite{MR3858403}.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of fractional $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the H\"{o}lder regularity of the fractional $p$-Laplace equation of the form $(-\Delta_p)^s u=f$ where $p&gt;1, s\in (0, 1)$ and $f\in L^\infty_{\rm loc}(\Omega)$. Specifically, we prove that $u\in C^{0, \gamma_\circ}_{\rm loc}(\Omega)$ for $\gamma_\circ=\min\{1, \frac{sp}{p-1}\}$, provided that $\frac{sp}{p-1}\neq 1$. In particular, it shows that $u$ is locally Lipschitz for $\frac{sp}{p-1}&gt;1$. Moreover, we show that for $\frac{sp}{p-1}=1$, the solution is locally Lipschitz, provided that $f$ is locally H\"{o}lder continuous. Additionally, we discuss further regularity results for the fractional double-phase problems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and exact concavity principles for parabolic and elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal of this paper is to study classes of Cauchy-Dirichlet problems which include parabolic equations of the type $$u_t -\Delta u= a(x,t)f(u)\quad\hbox{in $\Omega\times(0,T)$}$$ with $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ bounded, convex domain and $T\in(0,+\infty]$. Under suitable assumptions on $a$ and $f$, we show logarithmic or power concavity (in space, or in space-time) of the solution $u$; under some relaxed assumptions on $a$, we show moreover that $u$ enjoys concavity properties up to a controlled error. The results include relevant examples like the torsion $f(u)=1$, the Lane-Emden equation $f(u)=u^q$, $q\in(0,1)$, the eigenfunction $f(u)=u$, the logarithmic equation $f(u)=u\log(u^2)$, and the saturable nonlinearity $f(u)=\frac{u^2}{1+u}$. The logistic equation $f(x,u)=a(x)u-u^2$ can be treated as well.
  Some exact results give a different approach, as well as generalizations, to [Ishige-Salani2013, Ishige-Salani2016]. Moreover, some quantitative results are valid also in the elliptic framework $-\Delta u=a(x)f(u)$ and refine [Bucur-Squassina2019, Gallo-Squassina2024].</description>

      <title>Point Singularities of Solutions to the Stationary Incompressible MHD Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the point singularity of very weak solutions $(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{B})$ to the stationary MHD equations. More precisely, assume that the solution $(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{B})$ in the punctured ball $B_2\setminus \{0\}$ satisfies the vanishing condition (4), and that $|\mathbf{u}(x)|\le \varepsilon |x|^{-1},\ |\mathbf{B}(x)|\le C |x|^{-1}$ with small $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and general $C&gt;0$. Then, the leading order term of $\mathbf{u}$ is a Landau solution, while the $(-1)$ order term of $\mathbf{B}$ is $0$. In particular, for axisymmetric solutions $(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{B})$, the condition (4) holds provided $\mathbf{B} = B^{\theta}(r,z) \mathbf{e}_{\theta}$ or the boundary condition (7) is imposed.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Eigenvalues of the Fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimizers of \begin{equation} \lambda_k^s(A) + |A| \end{equation} where $\lambda^s_k(A)$ is the $k$-th Dirichlet eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian on $A$. Unlike in the case of the Laplacian, the free boundary of minimizers exhibit distinct global behavior. Our main results include: the existence of minimizers, optimal H\"older regularity for the corresponding eigenfunctions, and in the case where $\lambda_k$ is simple, non-degeneracy, density estimates, separation of the free boundary, and free boundary regularity. We propose a combinatorial toy problem related to the global configuration of such minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method of obtaining a posteriori estimates which does not use the duality theory and which applies to variational inequalities with monotone operators, without assuming the potentiality of operators. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on problems driven by nonlinear operators of the $p$-Laplacian type, including the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian, polyharmonic $p$-Laplacian, and fractional $p$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal operators in divergence form and existence theory for integrable data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an existence and uniqueness result for weak solutions of Dirichlet boundary value problems governed by a nonlocal operator in divergence form and in the presence of a datum which is assumed to belong only to $L^1(\Omega)$ and to be suitably dominated.
  We also prove that the solution that we find converges, as $s\nearrow 1$, to a solution of the local counterpart problem, recovering the classical result as a limit case. This requires some nontrivial customized uniform estimates and representation formulas, given that the datum is only in $L^1(\Omega)$ and therefore the usual regularity theory cannot be leveraged to our benefit in this framework.
  The limit process uses a nonlocal operator, obtained as an affine transformation of a homogeneous kernel, which recovers, in the limit as $s\nearrow 1$, every classical operator in divergence form.</description>

      <title>Local-in-time well-posedness for the regular solution to the 2D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosities and heat conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the two-dimensional Cauchy problem of the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations with far-field vacuum in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the viscosity and heat-conductivity coefficients depend on the absolute temperature $\theta$ in the form of $\theta^\nu$ with $\nu&gt;0$. Due to the appearance of the vacuum, the momentum equation are both degenerate in the time evolution and spatial dissipation, which makes the study on the well-posedness challenged. By establishing some new singular-weighted (negative powers of the density $\rho$) estimates of the solution, we establish the local-in-time well-posedness of the regular solution with far-field vacuum in terms of $\rho$, the velocity $u$ and the entropy $S$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Justification of a Baer$-$Nunziato Model for a Compressible Viscous Fluid with Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we justify a Baer$-$Nunziato system including appropriate closure terms as the macroscopic description of a compressible viscous fluid that can occur in a liquid or a vapor phase in the isothermal framework. As a mathematical model for the two-phase fluid on the detailed scale we chose a non-local version of the Navier$-$Stokes$-$Korteweg equations in the one-dimensional and periodic setting. Our justification relies on anticipating the macroscopic description of the two-phase fluid as the limit system for a sequence of solutions with highly oscillating initial densities. Interpreting the density as a parametrized measure, we extract a limit system consisting of a kinetic equation for the parametrized measure and a momentum equation for the velocity. Under the assumption that the initial density distributions converge in the limit to a convex combination of Dirac-measures, we show by a uniqueness result that the parametrized measure also has to be a convex combination of Dirac-measures and, that the limit system reduces to the Baer$-$Nunziato system. This work extends existing results concerning the justification of Baer$-$Nunziato models as the macroscopic description of multi-fluid models in the sense, that we allow for phase transition effects on the detailed scale. This work also includes a new global-in-time well-posedness result for the Cauchy problem of the non-local Navier$-$Stokes$-$Korteweg equations.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time Well-posedness of Classical Solutions to the Vacuum Free Boundary Problem for the Viscous Saint-Venant System with Large Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions to the vacuum free boundary problem of the 1-D viscous Saint-Venant system with large data. Since the depth $\rho$ of the fluid vanishes on the moving boundary, the momentum equations become degenerate both in the time evolution and spatial dissipation, which may lead to singularities for the derivatives of the velocity u of the fluid and then makes it challenging to study classical solutions. By exploiting the intrinsic degenerate-singular structures of this system, we are able to identify two classes of admissible initial depth profile and obtain the global well-posedness theory here: $\rho_0^\alpha\in H^3$ $(\frac{1}{3}&lt;\alpha&lt;1)$ vanishes as the distance to the moving boundary, which satisfies the BD entropy condition; while $\rho_0\in H^3$ vanishes as the distance to the moving boundary, which satisfies the physical vacuum boundary condition, but violates the BD entropy condition. Further, it is shown that for arbitrarily large time, the solutions obtained here are smooth (in Sobolev spaces) all the way up to the moving boundary. One of the key ingredients of the analysis here is to establish some degenerate weighted estimates for the effective velocity $v=u+ (\log\rho)_y$ (y is the Eulerian spatial coordinate) via its transport properties, which enables one to obtain the upper bounds for the first order derivatives of the flow map $\eta$. Then the global regularity uniformly up to the vacuum boundary can be obtained by carrying out a series of weighted energy estimates carefully designed for this system. It is worth pointing out that the result here seems to be the first global existence theory of classical solutions with large data that is independent of the BD entropy for such degenerate systems, and the methodology developed here can be applied to more general degenerate CNS.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness in determining multidimensional domains with unknown initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses several geometric inverse problems for some linear parabolic systems where the initial data (and even the coefficients) are unknown. The goal is to identify a subdomain within a multidimensional set. The non-homogeneous part of the equation is expressed as a function of separate space and time variables. We establish uniqueness results by incorporating observations that can be on the boundary or in an interior domain. Through this process, we also derive information about the initial data. The main tools required for the proofs include unique continuation, time analyticity of the solutions and semigroup theory.</description>

      <title>Compressible fluids excited by space-dependent transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the compressible Navier-Stokes system driven by physically relevant transport noise, where the noise influences both the continuity and momentum equations. Our approach is based on transforming the system into a partial differential equation with random, time- and space-dependent coefficients. A key challenge arises from the fact that these coefficients are non-differentiable in time, rendering standard compactness arguments for the identification of the pressure inapplicable. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a novel multi-layer approximation scheme and introduce a precise localization strategy with respect to both the sample space and time variable. The limit pressure is then identified via the corresponding effective viscous flux identity. By means of stochastic compactness methods, particularly Skorokhod's representation theorem and its generalization by Jakubowski, we ensure the progressive measurability required to return to the original system. Our results broaden the applicability of transport noise models in fluid dynamics and offer new insights into the interaction between stochastic effects and compressibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions to problems involving a superposition operator of the type $$\int_{[0, 1]}(- \Delta)^s u d \mu(s),$$ for a signed measure $\mu$ on the interval of fractional exponents $[0,1]$, when the nonlinearity is subcritical and asymptotically linear at infinity; thus, we deal with a perturbation of the eigenvalue problem for the superposition operator. We use variational tools, extending to this setting well-known results for the classical and the fractional Laplace operators.</description>

      <title>Global existence of measure-valued solutions to the multicomponent Smoluchowski coagulation equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global solutions to the multicomponent Smoluchowski coagulation equation are constructed for measure-valued initial data with minimal assumptions on the moments. The framework is based on an abstract formulation of the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem for uniform spaces. The result holds for a large class of coagulation rate kernels, satisfying a power-law upper bound with possibly different singularities at small-small, small-large and large-large coalescence pairs. This includes in particular both mass-conserving and gelling kernels, as well as interpolation kernels used in applications. We also provide short proofs of mass-conservation and gelation results for any weak solution, which extends previous results for one-component systems.</description>

      <title>Tumor-immune cell interactions by a fully parabolic chemotaxis model with logistic source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the existence of classical solutions to a class of chemotaxis systems reading
  \[\begin{cases}
  u_t = \Delta u-\chi \nabla\cdot(u \nabla v) + \mu_1 u^k -\mu_2 u^{k+1}, &amp; \text{in} \; \Omega\times(0,T_{\text{max}}), \\
  v_t= \Delta v+\alpha w-\beta v-\gamma u v, &amp; \text{in} \; \Omega\times(0,T_{\text{max}}), \\
  w_t= \Delta w-\delta u w+ \mu_3 w(1-w), &amp; \text{in} \; \Omega\times(0,T_{\text{max}}), \\
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial\nu}=\frac{\partial w}{\partial\nu}=0, &amp; \text{on} \; \partial\Omega\times(0,T_{\text{max}}), \\
  u(x,0)=u_0(x), \quad v(x,0)= v_0(x), \quad w(x,0)= w_0(x), &amp; x\in\overline{\Omega},
  \end{cases}\] that model interactions between tumor (i.e., $w$) and immune cells (i.e., $u$) with a logistic-type source term $\mu_1 u^k - \mu_2 u^{k+1}$, $k\geq1$, also in presence of a chemical signal (i.e., $v$). The model parameters $\chi, \mu_1,\mu_2, \mu_3, \alpha, \beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ are all positive. The value $T_{\text{max}}$ indicates the maximum instant of time up to which solutions are defined. Our focus is on examining the global existence in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \geq 3$, under Neumann boundary conditions. We distinguish between two scenarios: $k&gt;1$ and $k=1$. The first case allows to prove boundedness under smaller assumptions relying only on the model parameters instead of on the initial data, while the second case requires an extra condition relating the parameters $\chi, \mu_2$, $n$, and the initial data $\lVert v_0 \rVert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}$. This model can be seen as an extension of those previously examined in [11] and [4], being the former a system with only two equations and the latter the same model without logistic.</description>

Abstract: We consider an elliptic system of Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky type in a bounded and smooth domain of R3 with a non constant coupling factor. This kind of system has been introduced in the mathematical literature in [14] and in the last years many contributions appeared. In particular here we present the results in [2] and [34] which show existence of solutions by means of the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory under different boundary conditions on the electrostatic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on evolution equations on co-evolving, infinite, graphs and establish a rigorous link with a class of nonlinear continuity equations, whose vector fields depend on the graphs considered. More precisely, weak solutions of the so-called graph-continuity equation are shown to be the push-forward of their initial datum through the flow map solving the associated characteristics' equation, which depends on the co-evolving graph considered. This connection can be used to prove contractions in a suitable distance, although the flow on the graphs requires a too limiting assumption on the overall flux. Therefore, we consider upwinding dynamics on graphs with pointwise and monotonic velocity and prove long-time convergence of the solutions towards the uniform mass distribution.</description>

Abstract: We extend Hintz's cosmological black hole gluing result to the Einstein-Maxwell system with positive cosmological constant by gluing multiple Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter black holes into neighbourhoods of points in the conformal boundary of de Sitter space. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions on the black hole parameters -- related to Friedrich's conformal constraint equations -- for this gluing to be possible. We also improve the original gluing method slightly by showing that the construction of a solution in Taylor series may be accomplished using an exactness argument, eliminating the need for an early gauge-fixing.</description>

      <title>Classification of Solutions with Polynomial Energy Growth for the SU (n + 1) Toda System on the Punctured Complex Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the classification of solutions satisfying the polynomial energy growth condition near both the origin and infinity to the ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system on the punctured complex plane $\mathbb{C}^*$. The ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system is a class of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations of second order with significant implications in integrable systems, quantum field theory, and differential geometry. Building on the work of A. Eremenko (J. Math. Phys. Anal. Geom., Volume 3 p.39-46), Jingyu Mu's thesis, and others, we obtain the classification of such solutions by leveraging techniques from the Nevanlinna theory. In particular, we prove that the unitary curve corresponding to a solution with polynomial energy growth to the ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system on $\mathbb{C}^*$ gives a set of fundamental solutions to a linear homogeneous ODE of $(n+1)^{th}$ order, and each coefficient of the ODE can be written as a sum of a polynomial in $z$ and another one in $\frac{1}{z}$.</description>

Abstract: The result of Guan and Ma (Invent. Math. 151 (2003)) states that if $\phi^{-1/k} : \mathbb{S}^n \to (0,\infty)$ is spherically convex, then $\phi$ arises as the $\sigma_k$ curvature (the $k$-th elementary symmetric function of the principal radii of curvature) of a strictly convex hypersurface. In this paper, we establish an analogous result in the capillary setting in the half-space for $\theta\in(0,\pi/2)$: if $\phi^{-1/k} : \mathcal{C}_{\theta} \to (0,\infty)$ is a capillary function and spherically convex, then $\phi$ is the $\sigma_k$ curvature of a strictly convex capillary hypersurface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new Essentially Non-oscillatory (ENO) recovery algorithm is developed and tested in a Finite Volume method. The construction is hinged on a reformulation of the reconstruction as the solution to a variational problem. The sign property of the classical ENO algorithm is expressed as restrictions on the admissible set of solutions to this variational problem. In conjunction with an educated guessing algorithm for possible locations of discontinuities an ENO reconstruction algorithm without divided differences or smoothness indicators is constructed. No tunable parameters exist apart from the desired order and stencil width. The desired order is in principle arbitrary, but growing stencils are needed. While classical ENO methods consider all connected stencils that surround a cell under consideration the proposed recovery method uses a fixed stencil, simplifying efficient high order implementations.</description>

      <title>The Whitney method of fundamental solutions with Lusin wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation for a variant of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), where the source points $\{q_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ accumulate towards the domain in a Whitney fashion, meaning that their separation is proportional to the distance to the domain. We prove that the normalized Lusin wavelets $\psi_j(w) = b_j(w-q_j)^{-2}$ constitute a generalized basis, known as a frame, for the Hardy subspace of $L_2$-traces of holomorphic functions on the domain. Consequently, our method, where $\psi_j$ are used as basis functions in the MFS, enables a numerically stable approximation of solutions to Laplace boundary value problems, even when the solutions lack analytic continuation across the boundary. Despite the source points accumulating towards the domain, our computations show no loss of accuracy near the boundary, in contrast to the boundary integral equation method.</description>

      <title>$p$-Poincar\'e inequalities and capacity upper bounds on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, we prove that a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy satisfies the chain condition, the volume regular condition with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Phi$, and that both the Poincar\'e inequality and the capacity upper bound with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Psi$ hold if and only if $$\frac{1}{C}\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^p\le\frac{\Psi(R)}{\Psi(r)}\le C\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^{p-1}\frac{\Phi(R)}{\Phi(r)}\text{ for any }r\le R.$$ In particular, given any pair of doubling functions $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ satisfying the above inequality, we construct a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy on which all the above conditions are satisfied. As a direct corollary, we prove that a metric measure space is $d_h$-Ahlfors regular and has $p$-walk dimension $\beta_p$ if and only if $$p\le\beta_p\le d_h+(p-1).$$ Our proof builds on the Laakso-type space theory, which was recently developed by Murugan (arXiv:2410.15611).</description>

      <title>Analysis and structure-preserving approximation of a Cahn-Hilliard-Forchheimer system with solution-dependent mass and volume source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Forchheimer system featuring concentration-dependent mobility, mass source and convective transport. The velocity field is governed by a generalized quasi-incompressible Forchheimer equation with solution-dependent volume source. We impose Dirichlet boundary conditions for the pressure to accommodate the source term. Our contributions include a novel well-posedness result for the generalized Forchheimer subsystem via the Browder-Minty theorem, and existence of weak solutions for the full coupled system established through energy estimates at the Galerkin level combined with compactness techniques such as Aubin-Lions' lemma and Minty's trick. Furthermore, we develop a structure-preserving discretization using Raviart-Thomas elements for the velocity that maintains exact mass balance and discrete energy-dissipation balance, with well-posedness demonstrated through relative energy estimates and inf-sup stability. Lastly, we validate our model through numerical experiments, demonstrating optimal convergence rates, structure preservation, and the role of the Forchheimer nonlinearity in governing phase-field evolution dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of ancient ovals in higher dimensional mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the classification of compact ancient noncollapsed mean curvature flows of hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimensions. More precisely, we study $k$-ovals in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, defined as ancient noncollapsed solutions whose tangent flow at $-\infty$ is given by $\mathbb{R}^k \times S^{n-k}((2(n-k)|t|)^{\frac{1}{2}})$ for some $k \in \{1,\dots,n-1\}$, and whose fine cylindrical matrix has full rank. A significant advance achieved recently by Choi and Haslhofer suggests that the shrinking $n$-sphere and $k$-ovals together account for all compact ancient noncollapsed solutions in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We prove that $k$-ovals are $\mathbb{Z}^{k}_2 \times \mathrm{O}(n+1-k)$-symmetric and are uniquely determined by $(k-1)$-dimensional spectral ratio parameters. This result is sharp in view of the $(k-1)$-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}^{k}_2 \times \mathrm{O}(n+1-k)$-symmetric ancient ovals constructed by Du and Haslhofer, as well as the conjecture of Angenent, Daskalopoulos and Sesum concerning the moduli space of ancient solutions. We also establish a new spectral stability theorem, which suggests the local $(k-1)$-rectifiability of the moduli space of $k$-ovals modulo space-time rigid motion and parabolic rescaling. In contrast to the case of $2$-ovals in $\mathbb{R}^4$, resolved by Choi, Daskalopoulos, Du, Haslhofer and Sesum, the general case for arbitrary $k$ and $n$ presents new challenges beyond increased algebraic complexity. In particular, the quadratic concavity estimates in the collar region and the absence of a global parametrization with regularity information pose major obstacles. To address these difficulties, we introduce a novel test tensor that produces essential gradient terms for the tensor maximum principle, and we derive a local Lipschitz continuity result by parameterizing $k$-ovals with nearly matching spectral ratio parameters.</description>

      <title>High-Order Interior Penalty Finite Element Methods for Fourth-Order Phase-Field Models in Fracture Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for solving fourth-order phase-field models in brittle fracture mechanics using the Interior Penalty Finite Element Method (IP-FEM). The fourth-order model improves numerical stability and accuracy compared to traditional second-order phase-field models, particularly when simulating complex crack paths. The IP-FEM provides an efficient framework for discretizing these models, effectively handling nonconforming trial functions and complex boundary conditions.
  In this study, we leverage the FEALPy framework to implement a flexible computational tool that supports high-order IP-FEM discretizations. Our results show that as the polynomial order increases, the mesh dependence of the phase-field model decreases, offering improved accuracy and faster convergence. Additionally, we explore the trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy with varying polynomial orders and mesh sizes. The findings offer valuable insights for optimizing numerical simulations of brittle fracture in practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Creation of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Brownian particles, with or without inertia, interacting in the mean-field regime via a weak, smooth, long-range potential, and starting initially from an arbitrary exchangeable $N$-particle distribution. In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the so-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon: in weak norms, the mean-field approximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy $O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations, which is damped exponentially over time. The novelty is that the initial information appears in our estimates only through pair correlations, which currently seems inaccessible to other methods. This is complemented by corresponding results on higher-order creation of chaos in the form of higher-order correlation estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X,Y$ be Hilbert spaces and $\mathcal{A}\colon X\to X'$ a continuous and symmetric elliptic operator. We suppose that $X$ is dense in $Y$ and that the embedding $X\subset Y$ is compact. In this paper we show some consequences of this setting on the study of the fractional operator attached to $\mathcal{A}$ in the extension setting $\mathbb{R}^N\times (0, \infty)$. Being more specific, we will give some examples where the embedding $H(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)\subset L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is compact, with the space $H(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)$ depending on the operator $\mathcal{A}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Calder\'on problem for systems with unknown zeroth and first order terms, and improve on previously known results. More precisely, let $(M, g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, let $A$ be a connection matrix on $E = M \times \mathbb{C}^r$ and let $Q$ be a matrix potential. Let $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ be the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the associated connection Laplacian with a potential. Under the assumption that $(M, g)$ is isometrically contained in the interior of $(\mathbb{R}^2 \times M_0, c(e \oplus g_0))$, where $(M_0, g_0)$ is an arbitrary compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, $e$ is the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $c &gt; 0$, we show that $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ uniquely determines $(A, Q)$ up to natural gauge invariances. Moreover, we introduce new concepts of complex ray transform and complex parallel transport problem, and study their fundamental properties and relations to the Calder\'on problem.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bernstein inequalities and spectral inequality on thick sets for the Landau operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a spectral inequality for the Landau operator. This means that for all $f$ in the spectral subspace corresponding to energies up to $E$, the $L^2$-integral over suitable $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ can be lower bounded by an explicit constant times the $L^2$-norm of $f$ itself. We identify the class of all measurable sets $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ for which such an inequality can hold, namely so-called thick or relatively dense sets, and deduce an asymptotically optimal expression for the constant in terms of the energy, the magnetic field strength and in terms of parameters determining the thick set $S$. Our proofs rely on so-called magnetic Bernstein inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain the first proof of null-controllability for the magnetic heat equation (with sharp bound on the control cost), and can relax assumptions in existing proofs of Anderson localization in the continuum alloy-type model.</description>

Abstract: We consider an elliptic operator in which the second-order term is very small in one direction. In this regime, we study the behaviour of the principal eigenfunction and of the principal eigenvalue. Our first result deals with the limit of the principal eigenfunction and is shown with a representation of the principal eigenfunction as a quasi-stationary distribution. Subsequent results deal with the limit of the principal eigenvalue and are shown using Hamilton-Jacobi equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12635v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present in this paper a new way to define weighted Sobolev spaces when the weight functions are arbitrary small. This new approach can replace the old one consisting in modifying the domain by removing the set of points where at least one of the weight functions is very small. The basic idea is to replace the distributional derivative with a new notion of weak derivative. In this way, non-locally integrable functions can considered in these spaces. Indeed, assumptions under which a degenerate elliptic partial differential equation has a unique non-locally integrable solution are given. Tools like a Poincar\'e Inequality and a trace operator are developed, and density results of smooth function are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer is a very complex phenomenon that involves many different scales and situations. In this paper we consider a free boundary problem describing the evolution of a tumor colony and we derive a new asymptotic model for tumor growth. We focus on the case of a single phase tumor colony taking into account chemotactic effects in an early stage where there is no necrotic inner region. Thus, our model is valid for the case of multilayer avascular tumors with very little access to both nutrients and inhibitors or the case where the amount of nutrients and inhibitors is very similar to the amount consumed by the multilayer tumor cells. Our model takes the form of a single nonlocal and nonlinear partial differential equation. Besides deriving the model, we also prove a well-posedness result.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a couple of new nonlinear functional inequalities of Sobolev type akin to the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. In particular, one of the inequalities reads $$ \int_{\mathbb{S}^1}\arctan\left(\frac{\partial_x u}{u}\right)\partial_xu \,dx\geq \arctan\left(\|u(t)\|_{\dot{W}^{1,1}(\mathbb{S}^1)}\right)\|u(t)\|_{\dot{W}^{1,1}(\mathbb{S}^1)}. $$ Then, these inequalities are used in the study of the nonlinear \emph{arctan}-fast diffusion equation $$ \partial_t u-\partial_x\arctan\left(\frac{\partial_x u}{u}\right)=0. $$ For this highly nonlinear PDE we establish a number of well-posedness results and qualitative properties.</description>

      <title>A generalized Liouville equation and magnetic stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers two related families of nonlinear and nonlocal problems in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. The first main result derives the general integrable solution to a generalized Liouville equation using the Wronskian of two coprime complex polynomials. The second main result concerns an application to a generalized Ladyzhenskaya-Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, with a single real parameter $\beta$ interpreted as the strength of a magnetic self-interaction. The optimal constant of the inequality and the corresponding minimizers of the quotient are studied and it is proved that for $\beta \ge 2$, for which the constant equals $2\pi\beta$, such minimizers only exist at quantized $\beta \in 2\mathbb{N}$ corresponding to nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels with densities solving the generalized Liouville equation. This latter problem originates from the study of self-dual vortex solitons in the abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory and from the average-field-Pauli effective theory of anyons, i.e. quantum particles with statistics intermediate to bosons and fermions. An immediate application is given to Keller-Lieb-Thirring stability bounds for a gas of such anyons which self-interact magnetically (vector nonlocal repulsion) as well as electrostatically (scalar local/point attraction), thus generalizing the stability theory of the 2D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: We establish global existence of mild solutions to the BGK model proposed by Bouchut [J. Stat. Phys., 95, (1999), 113--170] under the minimal assumption of finite kinetic entropy initial data. Moreover we rigorously derive a kinetic entropy inequality, which combined with the theory developed by Berthelin and Vasseur [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 36, (2005), 1807--1835] leads to the hydrodynamic limit to the barotropic Euler equations. The main tools employed in the analysis are stability estimates for the Maxwellian and a velocity averaging lemma.</description>

      <title>SBV regularity of Entropy Solutions for Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws with General Flux function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that vanishing viscosity solutions to smooth non-degenerate systems of balance laws having small bounded variation, in one space dimension, must be functions of special bounded variation. For more than one equation, this is new also in the case of systems of conservation laws out of the context of genuine nonlinearity. For general smooth strictly hyperbolic systems of balance laws, this regularity fails, as known for systems of balance laws: we generalize the SBV-like regularity of the eigenvalue functions of the Jacobian matrix of flux from conservation to balance laws. Proofs are based on extending Oleinink-type balance estimates, with the introduction of new source measures, localization arguments, and observations in real analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we obtain weighted boundedness results for singular integral operators with kernels exhibiting exponential decay. We also show that the classes of weights are characterized by a suitable maximal operator. Additionally, we study the boundedness of various operators associated with the generalized Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta + \mu$, where $\mu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction of periodic fundamental solutions and periodic layer potentials for various differential operators. Specifically, we focus on the Laplace equation, the Helmholtz equation, the Lam\'e system, and the heat equation. We then describe how these layer potentials can be applied to analyze domain perturbation problems. In particular, we present applications to the asymptotic behavior of quasi-periodic solutions for a Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation in an unbounded domain with small periodic perforations. Additionally, we investigate the dependence of spatially periodic solutions of an initial value Dirichlet problem for the heat equation on regular perturbations of the base of a parabolic cylinder.</description>

      <title>Local elliptic regularity for solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations via Dirichlet forms and resolvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that, for a solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation with general coefficients, defined as a measure with an $L^2$-density, this density not only exhibits $H^{1,2}$-regularity but also H\"{o}lder continuity. To achieve this, we first construct a reference measure $\mu=\rho dx$ by utilizing existence and elliptic regularity results, ensuring that the given divergence-type operator corresponds to a sectorial Dirichlet form. By employing elliptic regularity results for homogeneous boundary value problems in both divergence and non-divergence type equations, we demonstrate that the image of the resolvent operator associated with the sectorial Dirichlet form has $H^{2,2}$-regularity. Furthermore, through calculations based on the Dirichlet form and the $H^{2,2}$-regularity of the resolvent operator, we prove that the density of the solution measure for the stationary Fokker-Planck equation is, indeed, the weak limit of $H^{1,2}$-functions defined via the resolvent operator. Our results highlight the central role of Dirichlet form theory and resolvent approximations in establishing the regularity of solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations with general coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of spatial convolutions by PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the approximation of spatial convolution with a given radial integral kernel. Previous studies have demonstrated that approximating spatial convolution using a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) can eliminate the analytical difficulties arising from integral formulations in one-dimensional space. In this paper, we establish a PDE system approximation for spatial convolutions in higher spatial dimensions. We derive an appropriate approximation function for given arbitrary radial integral kernels as a linear sum of Green functions. In establishing the validity of this methodology, we introduce an appropriate integral transformation to show the completeness of the basis constructed by the Green functions. This framework enables the approximation of nonlocal convolution-type operators with arbitrary radial integral kernels using linear sums of PDE solutions. Finally, we present numerical examples that illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Refinement of Pressure Decomposition in Navier-Stokes Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the local decomposition of pressure in the Navier-Stokes equations is dynamically refined to prove that a relevant critical energy of a suitable Leray-type solution inside a backward paraboloid -- regardless of its aperture -- is controlled near the vertex by a critical behavior confined to a neighborhood of the paraboloid's boundary. This neighborhood excludes the interior near the vertex and remains separated from the temporal profile of the vertex, except at the vertex itself. Then, we present a refined scaling invariant regularity result.</description>

      <title>New Liouville type theorems for 3D steady incompressible MHD equations and Hall-MHD equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Liouville type results for the three-dimensional stationary incompressible MHD equations and Hall-MHD equations. By a new iteration argument, we establish Liouville type theorems if the velocity and magnetic field satisfy certain growth conditions of Lebesgue norms on the annulus. In our iteration procedure, the $L^2$ norms of the gradients of the velocity and magnetic field and the $L^6$ norms of the velocity and magnetic field are iterated together. The conditions imposed on the magnetic field are weaker than the velocity field in certain sense. As a consequence, we show that the velocity and magnetic field are trivial provided that they belong to some Lebesgue spaces or satisfy some decay conditions at infinity. Our results extend and improve the recent works of Chae-Lee (2024 Nonlinearity 37 095006) and Cho-Neustupa-Yang (2024 Nonlinearity 37 035007).</description>

      <title>An abstract uncertainty principle with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04345v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under Wigdersons' framework and by sorting out the technical points in the recent works of Tang (J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 31 (2025)) and Dias-Luef-Prata (J. Math. Pures Appl. (9) 198 (2025)), we prove an abstract uncertainty principle for functions in the $L^p$ setting. An immediate consequence is a new uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform, unifying and extending many existing results. More applications are shown for PDEs, including the moment growth estimates for some linear and nonlinear dispersive equations, and a type of weighted lower bound estimate for the spacetime moment of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and heat equation inspired by the control theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove new lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces, and, in particular, on all convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces. In order to do this, we also obtain log-scale lossless Strichartz and spectral projection estimates on manifolds of uniformly bounded geometry with nonpositive and negative sectional curvatures, extending the recent works of the first two authors for compact manifolds. We are able to use these along with known $L^2$-local smoothing and new $L^2 \to L^q$ half-localized resolvent estimates to obtain our lossless bounds.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for Consensus-Based Optimization and Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transfer convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach requires a generalization of Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems. In addition, we present new results on the well-posedness of the particle systems and their mean-field limit, and provide novel stability estimates for the weighted mean and the weighted covariance.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

      <title>Analytical obstructions to the weak approximation of Sobolev mappings into manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any integer $ p \geq 2 $, we construct a compact Riemannian manifold $ \mathcal{N} $ such that if $ \dim \mathcal{M} &gt; p $, there is a map in the Sobolev space of mappings $ W^{1,p} (\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ which is not a weak limit of smooth maps into $ \mathcal{N} $ due to a mechanism of analytical obstruction. For $ p = 4n - 1 $, the target manifold can be taken to be the sphere $ \mathbb{S}^{2n} $ thanks to the construction by Whitehead product of maps with nontrivial Hopf invariant, generalizing the result by Bethuel for $ p = 4n -1 = 3$. The results extend to higher order Sobolev spaces $ W^{s,p} $, with $ s \in \mathbb{R} $, $s \geq 1 $, $ sp \in \mathbb{N}$, and $ sp \ge 2 $.</description>
