      <title>Modeling and Design of Compact, Permanent-Magnet Transport Systems for Highly Divergent, Broad Energy Spread Laser-Driven Proton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven (LD) ion acceleration has been explored in a newly constructed short focal length beamline at the BELLA petawatt facility (interaction point 2, iP2). For applications utilizing such LD ion beams, a beam transport system is required, which for reasons of compactness be ideally contained within 3 m. While they are generated from a micron-scale source, large divergence and energy spread of LD ion beams present a unique challenge to transporting them compared to beams from conventional accelerators. This study gives an overview of proposed compact transport designs using permanent magnets satisfying different requirements depending on the application for the iP2 proton beamline such as radiation biology, material science, and high energy density science. These designs are optimized for different parameters such as energy spread and peak proton density according to the application's need. The various designs consist solely of permanent magnet elements, which can provide high magnetic field gradients on a small footprint. While the field strengths are fixed, we have shown that the beam size is able to be tuned effectively by varying the placement of the magnets. The performance of each design was evaluated based on high order particle tracking simulations of typical LD proton beams. We also examine the ability of certain configurations to tune and select beam energies, critical for specific applications. A more detailed investigation was carried out for a design to deliver 10 MeV LD accelerated ions for radiation biology applications. With these transport system designs, the iP2 beamline is ready to house various application experiments.</description>

      <title>Fluid Models from Kinetic Models using a Geometric Averaging Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2767</link>
      <description>arXiv:0912.2767v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We interpret the Lorentz force equation as a geodesic equation associated with a non-linear connection. Using a geometric averaging procedure, we prove that for narrow and smooth one-particle distribution functions whose supports are invariant under the flow of the Lorentz equation, a bunch of charged point particles can be described by a charged cold fluid model in the ultra-relativistic regime. The method used to prove this result does not require additional hypotheses on the higher moments of the distribution. This is accomplished by estimating the expressions that include the differential operators appearing in the charged cold fluid model equation. Under the specified conditions of narrowness and ultra-relativistic dynamics, it turns out that these differential expressions are close to zero, justifying the use of the charged cold fluid model. The method presented in the work can also be applied to justify the use of warm plasmas and other models.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration, implying the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model with maximal proper acceleration, showing that the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>Prototype design of a digital Low-Level RF system for S3FEL S-band Transverse Deflecting Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse Deflecting Cavity (TDC) is generally operated on pulsed mode for beam diagnosis. We plan to deploy two sets of S-band and three sets of X-band TDCs to accurately measure the longitudinal time distribution of ultra-short electron beam pulses in Shenzhen Superconducting Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (S3FEL). A microwave system of one TDC consists of a Low-Level RF system (LLRF), a solid-state amplifier, waveguide couplers, and a klystron, operated in pulse mode with a maximum repetition frequency of 50 Hz. Its microwave amplitude and phase stability must be better than 0.06%/0.08{\deg} (RMS). This article will introduce the prototype design of the hardware, firmware, and software of the digital LLRF system for S-band TDCs. We use homemade local oscillator and commercial cards based on the MicroTCA standard in hardware design. The firmware design will use a Non-IQ demodulation and a reference-tracking algorithm to eliminate the measurement noise and drift. The software design is based on the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System, achieving data acquisition, slow control, and interface display functions. This technical report will also show some preliminary test results.</description>
