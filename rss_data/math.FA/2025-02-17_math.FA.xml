      <title>Fixed point results and the Ekeland variational principle in vector $B$-metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the concept of \( b \)-metric spaces to the vectorial case, where the distance is vector-valued, and the constant in the triangle inequality axiom is replaced by a matrix. For such spaces, we establish results analogous to those in the \( b \)-metric setting: fixed-point theorems, stability results, and a variant of Ekeland's variational principle. As a consequence, we also derive a variant of Caristi's fixed-point theorem</description>

      <title>On Cantor sets with arbitrary Hausdorff and packing measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every couple of Hausdorff functions $\psi, \varphi$ verifying some mild assumptions, we construct a compact subset $ K $ of the Baire space such that the $\varphi$-Hausdorff measure and the $\psi$-packing measure on $ K $ are both finite and positive. We then embed such examples in any infinite-dimensional Banach space to answer positively to a question of Fan on the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.</description>

      <title>Robustness of infinite frames and Besselian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the concepts of Minimal Redundancy Condition (MRC) and robustness of erasures for infinite frames in Hilbert spaces. We begin by establishing a comprehensive framework for the MRC, emphasizing its importance in ensuring the stability and resilience of frames under finite erasures. Furthermore, we discussed the robustness of erasures, which generalizes the ability of a frame to withstand information loss. The relationship between robustness, MRC, and excess of a frame is carefully examined, providing new insights into the interplay between these properties. The robustness of Besselian frames, highlighting their potential in applications where erasure resilience is critical. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of frame theory and its role in addressing challenges posed by erasure recovery.</description>

      <title>An atomic decomposition of one-dimensional metric currents without boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves an atomic decomposition of the space of $1$-dimensional metric currents without boundary, in which the atoms are specified by closed Lipschitz curves with uniform control on their Morrey norms. Our argument relies on a geometric construction which states that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ one can express a piecewise-geodesic closed curve as the sum of piecewise-geodesic closed curves whose total length is at most $(1+\epsilon)$ times the original length and whose Morrey norms are each bounded by a universal constant times $\epsilon^{-2}$. In Euclidean space, our results refine the state of the art, providing an approximation of divergence free measures by limits of sums of closed polygonal paths whose total length can be made arbitrarily close to the norm of the approximated measure.</description>

      <title>Hardy-Hilbert type inequalities on homogeneous groups-An introduction and generalization to the kernel case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a lot of information available concerning Hardy-Hilbert type inequalities in one or more dimensions. In this paper we introduce the development of such inequalities on homogeneous groups. Moreover, we point out a unification of several of the Hardy-Hilbert type inequalities in the classical case to a general kernel case. Finally, we generalize these results to the homogeneous group case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive Borel measure $\mu$ on the complex space $\mathbb{C}$ to be a $(\infty,q)$ or $(p,\infty)$ (vanishing) Fock-Carleson measure through its Berezin transform. Then we discuss boundedness and compactness of the Toeplitz operator $T_{\mu}$  with a positive Borel measure $\mu$ as symbol on Fock space $F_{\alpha}^{\infty}$. Furthermore, we charaterize these properties of the Toeplitz operator T_{\varphi}$ with a symbol $\varphi$ which is in $BMO$.</description>

      <title>A new formula for the weighted Moore-Penrose inverse and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the general setting of the adjointable operators on Hilbert $C^*$-modules, this paper deals mainly with the weighted Moore-Penrose (briefly weighted M-P) inverse $A^\dag_{MN}$ in the case that the weights $M$ and $N$ are self-adjoint invertible operators, which need not to be positive. A new formula linking $A^\dag_{MN}$ to $A$, $A^\dag$, $M$ and $N$ is derived, in which $A^\dag$ denotes the M-P inverse of $A$. Based on this formula, some new results on the weighted M-P inverse are obtained. Firstly, it is shown that $A^\dag_{MN}=A^\dag_{ST}$ for some positive definite operators $S$ and $T$. This shows that $A^\dag_{MN}$ is essentially an ordinary weighted M-P inverse. Secondly, some limit formulas for the ordinary weighted M-P inverse originally known for matrices are generalized and improved. Thirdly, it is shown that when $A,M$ and $N$ act on the same Hilbert $C^*$-module, $A^\dag_{MN}$ belongs to the $C^*$-algebra generated by $A$, $M$ and $N$. Finally, some characterizations of the continuity of the weighted M-P inverse are provided.</description>

      <title>Norm-attaining lattice homomorphisms and renormings of Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known theorem due to R. C. James states that a Banach space is reflexive if and only if every bounded linear functional attains its norm. In this note we study Banach lattices on which every (real-valued) lattice homomorphism attains its norm. Contrary to what happens in the Banach space setting, we show that this property is not invariant under lattice isomorphisms. Namely, we show that in an AM-space every lattice homomorphism attains its norm, whereas every infinite-dimensional $C(K)$ space admits an equivalent lattice norm with a lattice homomorphism which does not attain its norm. Furthermore, we characterize coordinate functionals of atoms and show that whenever a Banach lattice $X$ supports a strictly positive functional, there exists a renorming with the property that the only (non-trivial) lattice homomorphisms attaining their norm are precisely these coordinate functionals. As a consequence, one can exhibit examples of Dedekind complete Banach lattices admitting a renorming with a non-norm-attaining lattice homomorphism, answering negatively questions posed by Dantas, Rodr\'iguez Abell\'an, Rueda Zoca and the fourth author.</description>

      <title>An optimal estimate for the norm of wavelet localization operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove an optimal estimate for the norm of wavelet localization operators with Cauchy wavelet and weight functions that satisfy two constraints on different Lebesgue norms. We prove that multiple regimes arise according to the ratio of these norms: if this ratio belongs to a fixed interval (which depends on the Lebesgue exponents) then both constraints are active, while outside this interval one of the constraint is inactive. Furthermore, we characterize optimal weight functions.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Constructing Parseval Fusion Frames via Scaling Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Parseval fusion frames is highly desirable in a wide range of signal processing applications. In this paper, we study the problem of modifying the weights of a fusion frame in order to generate a Parseval fusion frame. To this end, we extend the notion of the scalability to the fusion frame setting. We then proceed to characterize scalable fusion Riesz bases and $1$-excess fusion frames. Furthermore, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the scalability of certain $k$-excess fusion frames, $k\geq 2$. Finally, we present several pertinent examples to confirm the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Maximal operator on variable exponent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $M$ on variable exponent spaces. Our findings demonstrate that the Muckenhoupt condition, in conjunction with Nekvinda's decay condition, implies the boundedness of $M$ even for unbounded exponents. This extends the results of Lerner, Cruz-Uribe and Fiorenza for bounded exponents. We also introduce a novel argument that allows approximate unbounded exponents by bounded ones while preserving the Muckenhoupt and Nekvinda conditions.</description>

Abstract: We construct canonical p-energy measures associated with $p$-energy forms without any self-similarity, where $p$-energy forms are $L^p$ variations of Dirichlet forms, which have recently been studied mainly on fractals. Furthermore, we prove that the measures satisfy suitable chain rules and that the uniqueness of such a "good" energy measures. As an application, we also prove the p-energy version of Mosco's domination principle.</description>

Abstract: The injectivity of ReLU layers in neural networks, the recovery of vectors from clipped or saturated measurements, and (real) phase retrieval in $\mathbb{R}^n$ allow for a similar problem formulation and characterization using frame theory. In this paper, we revisit all three problems with a unified perspective and derive lower Lipschitz bounds for ReLU layers and clipping which are analogous to the previously known result for phase retrieval and are optimal up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Edge detection with polynomial frames on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, we have shown that a variety of localized polynomial frames, including isotropic as well as directional systems, are suitable for detecting jump discontinuities along circles on the sphere. More precisely, such edges can be identified in terms of their position and orientation by the asymptotic decay of the frame coefficients in an arbitrary small neighborhood. In this paper, we will extend these results to discontinuities which lie along general smooth curves. In particular, we prove upper and lower estimates for the frame coefficients when the analysis function is concentrated in the vicinity of such a singularity. The estimates are given in an asymptotic sense, with respect to some dilation parameter, and they hold uniformly in a neighborhood of the smooth curve segment under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a nonnegative function $g$ and a set $\Lambda = \{\lambda_1 &lt; \lambda_2 &lt; \dots\}$ of positive real numbers such that the system $\{g(x-\lambda_n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is complete simultaneously in all $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ spaces, $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, and $\Lambda$ satisfies one of the following two additional conditions: either $\Lambda$ is very sparse, namely, the ratios $\lambda_{n+1}/\lambda_n$ tend to $1$ arbitrarily slowly; or the differences $\lambda_{n+1} - \lambda_n$ attain only two different values, so $\Lambda$ has finite local complexity. Both constructions are, in a sense, extreme: it is well known that $\Lambda$ cannot be Hadamard lacunary and cannot be contained in any arithmetic progression.</description>

      <title>Non-Gibbsian Multivariate Ewens Probability Distributions on Regular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ewens' sampling formula (ESF) provides the probability distribution governing the number of distinct genetic types and their respective frequencies at a selectively neutral locus under the infinitely-many-alleles model of mutation. A natural and significant question arises: ``Is the Ewens probability distribution on regular trees Gibbsian?"
  In this paper, we demonstrate that Ewens probability distributions can be regarded as non-Gibbsian distributions on regular trees and derive a sufficient condition for the consistency condition. This study lays the groundwork for a new direction in the theory of non-Gibbsian probability distributions on trees.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce the H-infinity functional calculus for unbounded bisectorial operators in a Clifford module over the algebra R_n. While recent studies have focused on bounded operators or unbounded paravector operators, we now investigate unbounded fully Clifford operators and define polynomially growing functions of them. We first generate the omega-functional calculus for functions that exhibit an appropriate decay at zero and at infinity. We then extend to functions with a finite value at zero and at infinity. Finally, using a subsequent regularization procedure, we can define the H-infinity functional calculus for the class of regularizable functions, which in particular include functions with polynomial growth at infinity and, if T is injective, also functions with polynomial growth at zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the approximation spaces of a broad class of bases - which includes almost greedy bases - in terms of weighted Lorentz spaces. For those bases, we also find necessary and sufficient conditions under which the approximation spaces and greedy classes are the same.</description>

      <title>Operator-isomorphism pairs and Zak transform methods for the study of Gabor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We collect and summarize results on the unitary equivalence of Gabor systems by pairs of unitary operators and global isometries. The methods are then used to study Gabor systems with Hermite functions. We provide new proofs of some known results and an outlook on double over-sampling.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations for Lagrangian systems and geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we shall use the abstract bifurcation theorems developed by the author in previous papers to study bifurcations of solutions for Lagrangian systems on manifolds linearly or nonlinearly dependent on parameters under various boundary value conditions. As applications, many bifurcation results for geodesics on Finsler and Riemannian manifolds are derived.</description>

      <title>Global Solver based on the Sperner-Lemma and Mazurkewicz-Knaster-Kuratowski-Lemma based proof of the Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18816v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper a fixed-point solver for mappings from a Simplex into itself that is gradient-free, global and requires $d$ function evaluations for halvening the error is presented, where $d$ is the dimension. It is based on topological arguments and uses the constructive proof of the Mazurkewicz-Knaster-Kuratowski lemma as used as part of the proof for Brouwers Fixed-Point theorem.</description>

      <title>Cohomological characterisation of hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any geodesic metric space $X$, we give a complete cohomological characterisation of the hyperbolicity of $X$ in terms of vanishing of its second $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology. We extend this result to the relative setting of $X$ with a collection of uniformly hyperbolic subgraphs. As an application, we give a cohomological characterisation of acylindrical hyperbolicity.</description>
