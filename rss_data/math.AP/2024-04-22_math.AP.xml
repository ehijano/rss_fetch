      <title>Homogenization on parallelizable Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the homogenization limit of oscillating linear elliptic equations on an arbitrary parallelizable manifold $(M,g,\Gamma)$. We replicate the concept of two-scale convergence by pulling back tensors $T$ defined on the torus bundle $\mathbb{T}M$ to $M$. The process consist of two steps: localization in the slow variable through Voronoi domains, and inducing local periodicity in the fast variable from the local exponential map in combination with the geometry of the torus bundle. The procedure yields explicit cell formulae for the homogenization limit and as a byproduct a theory of two-scale convergence of tensors of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>Carleman estimates for parabolic equations with super strong degeneracy in a set of positive measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the obtainment of new Carleman estimates for linear parabolic equations, where the second-order differential operator brings a super strong degeneracy in a positive measure subset of the spatial domain. In order to prove our main result, the control domain is supposed to contain the set of degeneracies. As a well-known consequence, we achieve a null controllability result in the current context.</description>

      <title>Sharp conditions for energy balance in two-dimensional incompressible ideal flow with external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth solutions of the forced incompressible Euler equations satisfy an energy balance, where the rate-of-change in time of the kinetic energy equals the work done by the force per unit time. Interesting phenomena such as turbulence are closely linked with rough solutions which may exhibit {\it inviscid dissipation}, or, in other words, for which energy balance does not hold.
  This article provides a characterization of energy balance for physically realizable weak solutions of the forced incompressible Euler equations, i.e. solutions which are obtained in the limit of vanishing viscosity. More precisely, we show that, in the two-dimensional periodic setting, strong convergence of the zero-viscosity limit is both necessary and sufficient for energy balance of the limiting solution, under suitable conditions on the external force. As a consequence, we prove energy balance for a general class of solutions with initial vorticity belonging to rearrangement-invariant spaces, and going beyond Onsager's critical regularity.</description>

      <title>The free elastic flow for closed planar curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free elastic flow is the $L^2$-gradient flow for Euler's elastic energy, or equivalently the Willmore flow with translation invariant initial data. In contrast to elastic flows under length penalisation or preservation, it is more challenging to study the free elastic flow's asymptotic behavior, and convergence for closed curves is lost. In this paper, we nevertheless determine the asymptotic shape of the flow for initial curves that are geometrically close to circles, possibly multiply-covered, proving that the an appropriate rescaling smoothly converges to a unique round circle.</description>

      <title>Coexisting steady-state solutions of a class of reaction-diffusion systems with different boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a reaction-diffusion system in which both species are influenced by self-diffusion. Due to Hopf's boundary lemma, we obtain the boundedness of the classical solution of the system. By considering a particular function, we provide a complete characterization of the parameter ranges such that coexisting solutions of the system do not exist under three boundary conditions. Then based on the maximum principle, a sufficient condition for the existence of constant coexisting solutions of the system under Neumann boundary conditions was derived.</description>

      <title>Introducing spontaneous curvature to the Helfrich flow: Singularities and convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there are various results on the long-time behavior of the Willmore flow, the Helfrich flow with non-zero spontaneous curvature as its natural generalization is not yet well-understood. Past results for the gradient flow of a locally area- and volume-constrained Willmore flow indicate the existence of finite-time singularities which corresponds to the scaling-behavior of the underlying energy. However, for a non-vanishing spontaneous curvature, the scaling behavior is not quite as conclusive.
  Indeed, in this article, we find that a negative spontaneous curvature corresponds to finite-time singularities of the locally constrained Helfrich flow if the initial surface is energetically close to a round sphere. Conversely however, in the case of a positive spontaneous curvature, we find a positive result in terms of the convergence behavior: The locally area-constrained Helfrich flow starting in a spherical immersion with suitably small Helfrich energy exists globally and converges to a Helfrich immersion after reparametrization. Moreover, this energetic smallness assumption is given by an explicit energy threshold depending on the spontaneous curvature and the local area constraint of the energy.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for a general nonlinear parabolic equation in non-divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize regular boundary points in terms of a barrier family for a general form of a parabolic equation that generalizes both the standard parabolic $p$-Laplace equation and the normalized version arising from stochastic game theory. Using this result we prove geometric conditions that ensure regularity by constructing suitable barrier families. We also prove that when $q&lt;2$, a single barrier does not suffice to guarantee regularity.</description>

      <title>Relative Energy Method For Weak-Strong Uniqueness Of The Inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a weak-strong uniqueness result for the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes (INS) equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=2,3$) for bounded initial densities that are far from vacuum. Given a strong solution within the class employed in Paicu, Zhang and Zhang (2013) and Chen, Zhang and Zhao (2016), and a Leray-Hopf weak solution, we establish that they coincide if the initial data agree. The strategy of our proof is based on the relative energy method and new $W^{-1,p}$-type stability estimates for the density. A key point lies in proving that every Leray-Hopf weak solution originating from initial densities far from vacuum remains distant from vacuum at all times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent work of the third author, we revisit a classic example given by Fritz John of a semi-linear wave equation which exhibits finite in time blow up for all compactly supported data. We present the construction of future global solutions from asymptotic data given in arXiv:2204.12870(2022) for this specific example, and clarify the relation of this result of Yu to John's theorem. Furthermore we present a novel blow up result for finite energy solutions satisfying a sign condition due to the first author, and invoke this result to show that the constructed backwards in time solutions blow up in the past.</description>

Abstract: We present a stability result for ground states of a Schrodinger-Poisson system in $(2+1)$ dimension, modelling the propagation of a light beam through a liquid crystal with nonlocal nonlinear response. A new estimate for perturbations of the medium configuration allows to explicitly prove strict positivity of the second derivative of the action on a ground state. In addition we prove existence of a ground state with frequency $\sigma$ for any $\sigma \in (0,1)$ by a continuity method.</description>

      <title>LRBF meshless methods for predicting soil moisture distribution in root zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a coupled numerical model of unsaturated flow in soils and plant root water uptake. The Richards equation and different formulations are used in the developed numerical model to describe infiltration in root zone and to investigate the impact of the plant root on the distribution of soil moisture. The Kirchhoff transformed Richards equation is used and the Gardner model is considered for capillary pressure. In our approach, we employ a meshless method based on localized radial basis functions (LRBF) to solve the resulting system of equations. The LRBF approach is an accurate and computationally efficient method that does not require mesh generation and is flexible in addressing high-dimensional problems with complex geometries. Furthermore, this method leads to a sparse matrix system, which avoids ill-conditioning issues. We implement the coupled numerical model of infiltration and plant root water uptake for one, two, and three-dimensional soils. Numerical experiments are performed using nontrivial analytical solutions and available experimental data to validate the coupled numerical model. The numerical results demonstrate the performance and ability of the proposed numerical method to predict soil moisture dynamics in root zone.</description>

      <title>On extremal points for some vectorial total variation seminorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the set of extremal points of the generalized unit ball induced by gradient total variation seminorms for vector-valued functions on bounded Euclidean domains. These extremal points are central to the understanding of sparse solutions and sparse optimization algorithms for variational regularization problems posed among such functions. For not fully vectorial cases in which either the domain or the target are one dimensional, or the sum of the total variations of each component is used, we prove that these extremals are fully characterized as in the scalar-valued case, that is, they consist of piecewise constant functions with two regions. For definitions involving more involved matrix norms and in particular spectral norms, which are of interest in image processing, we produce families of examples to show that the resulting set of extremal points is larger and includes piecewise constant functions with more than two regions. We also consider the total deformation induced by the symmetrized gradient, for which minimization with linear constraints appears in problems of determination of limit loads in a number of continuum mechanical models involving plasticity, bringing relevance to the corresponding extremal points. For this case, we show piecewise infinitesimally rigid functions with two pieces to be extremal under mild assumptions. Finally, as an example of an extremal which is not piecewise constant, we prove that unit radial vector fields are extremal for the Frobenius total variation in the plane.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we first obtain a constant rank theorem for the second fundamental form of the space-time level sets of a space-time quasiconcave solution of the heat equation. Utilizing this constant rank theorem, we can obtain some strictly convexity results of the spatial and space-time level sets of the space-time quasiconcave solution of the heat equation in a convex ring. To explain our ideas and for completeness, we also review the constant rank theorem technique for the space-time Hessian of space-time convex solution of heat equation and for the second fundamental form of the convex level sets for harmonic function.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of slow dispersal in multi-species communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $N \geq 2$, we show that there are choices of diffusion rates $\{d_i\}_{i=1}^N$ such that for $N$ competing species which are ecologically identical and having distinct diffusion rates, the slowest disperser is able to competitive exclude the remainder of the species. In fact, the choices of such diffusion rates is open in the Hausdorff topology. Our result provides some evidence in the affirmative direction regarding the conjecture by Dockery et al. in 1998. The main tools include Morse decomposition of the semiflow, as well as the theory of normalized principal Floquet bundle for linear parabolic equations. A critical step in the proof is to establish the smooth dependence of the Floquet bundle on diffusion rate and other coefficients, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantitative derivation of a two-phase porous media system from the one-velocity Baer-Nunziato and Kapila systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate two types of relaxation processes quantitatively in the context of small data global-in-time solutions for compressible one-velocity multi-fluid models. First, we justify the pressure-relaxation limit from a one-velocity Baer-Nunziato system to a Kapila model as the pressure-relaxation parameter tends to zero, in a uniform manner with respect to the time-relaxation parameter associated to the friction forces modeled in the equation of the velocity. This uniformity allows us to further consider the time-relaxation limit for the Kapila model. More precisely, we show that the diffusely time-rescaled solution of the Kapila system converges to the solution of a two-phase porous media type system as the time-relaxation parameter tends to zero. For both relaxation limits, we exhibit explicit convergence rates.     Our proof of existence results are based on an elaborate low-frequency and high-frequency analysis via the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and it includes three main ingredients: a refined spectral analysis for the linearized problem to determine the threshold of frequencies explicitly in terms of the time-relaxation parameter, the introduction of an effective flux in the low-frequency region to overcome the loss of parameters due to the overdamping phenomenon, and the renormalized energy estimates in the high-frequency region to cancel higher-order nonlinear terms. To show the convergence rates, we discover several auxiliary unknowns that reveal better structures. In conclusion, our approach may be applied to a class of non-symmetric partially dissipative hyperbolic system with rough coefficients which do not have any time-integrability, in the context of overdamping phenomenon. It extends the latest results of Danchin and the first author [15, 16].</description>

Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of Green functions for the Cheeger $Q$-Laplacian in metric measure spaces that are Ahlfors $Q$-regular and support a $Q$-Poincar\'e inequality with $Q&gt;1$. We prove uniqueness of Green functions both in the case of relatively compact domains, and in the global (unbounded) case. We also prove existence of global Green functions in unbounded spaces, complementing the existing results in relatively compact domains proved recently in [BBL20].</description>

      <title>Sharp extension problem characterizations for higher fractional power operators in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp characterizations of higher order fractional powers $(-L)^s$, where $s&gt;0$ is noninteger, ofgenerators $L$ of uniformly bounded $C_0$-semigroups on Banach spaces via extension problems, which in particular include results of Caffarelli-Silvestre, Stinga-Torrea and Gal\'e-Miana-Stinga when $0&lt;s&lt;1$. More precisely, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions $U(y)$, $y\geq0$, to initial value problems for both higher order and second order extension problems and characterizations of $(-L)^su$, $s&gt;0$, in terms of boundary derivatives of $U$ at $y=0$, under the sharp hypothesis that $u$ is in the domain of $(-L)^s$. Our results resolve the question of setting up the correct initial conditions that guarantee well-posedness of both extension problems. Furthermore, we discover new explicit subordination formulas for the solution $U$ in terms of the semigroup $\{e^{tL}\}_{t\geq0}$ generated by $L$.</description>

      <title>Jerison-Lee identity and Semi-linear subelliptic equation on CR manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of the extremal for Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group and the Cauchy-Riemann(CR) Yamabe problem, Jerison-Lee found a three-dimensional family of differential identities for critical exponent subelliptic equation on Heisenberg group $\mathbb H^n$ by using the computer in [11]. They wanted to know whether there is a theoretical framework that would predict the existence and the structure of such formulae. With the help of dimensional conservation and invariant tensors, we can answer the above question. For a class of subcritical exponent subelliptic equations on the CR manifold, several new types of differential identities are found. Then we use those identities to get the rigidity result, where rigidity means that subelliptic equations have no other solution than some constant at least when parameters are in a certain range. The rigidity result also deduces the sharp Folland-Stein inequality on closed CR manifolds.</description>

      <title>Global entropy solutions to a degenerate parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system for flux-limited dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existence of global finite-time bounded entropy solutions to a parabolic-parabolic system proposed in [16] is established in bounded domains under no-flux boundary conditions for nonnegative bounded initial data. This modification of the classical Keller-Segel model features degenerate diffusion and chemotaxis that are both subject to flux-saturation. The approach is based on Schauder's fixed point theorem and calculus of functions of bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Collision of two solitons for $1d$ Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with the same mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to every one-dimensional model with polynomial odd nonlinearity having a stable soliton such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation in variable Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly concerned with the well-posedness of the dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation in the framework of variable Lebesgue spaces. Based on some analytical results developed in the variable Lebesgue spaces and the $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ decay estimates of the fractional heat kernel, we establish the local existence and regularity of solutions to the 2D dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation in the variable Lebesgue space.</description>

      <title>Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Field Dislocation Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fully nonlinear (geometric and material) system of Field Dislocation Mechanics is reviewed to establish an exact analogy with the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (ideal MHD) under suitable physically simplifying circumstances. Weak solutions with various conservation properties have been established for ideal MHD recently by Faraco, Lindberg, and Szekelyhidi using the techniques of compensated compactness of Tartar and Murat and convex integration; by the established analogy, these results would seem to be transferable to the idealization of Field Dislocation Mechanics considered. A dual variational principle is designed and discussed for this system of PDE, with the technique transferable to the study of MHD as well.</description>

      <title>Viscous shock waves of Burgers equation with fast diffusion and singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic stability of viscous shock waves for Burgers' equation with fast diffusion $u_t+f(u)_x=\mu (u^m)_{xx}$ on $\mathbb{R} \times (0, +\infty)$ when $0&lt;m&lt;1$. For the proposed constant states $u_-&gt;u_+=0$, the equation with fast diffusion $(u^m)_{xx}=m\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}}\right)_x$ processes a strong singularity at $u_+=0$, which causes the stability study to be challenging. We observe that, there exist two different types of viscous shocks, one is the non-degenerate shock satisfying Lax's entropy condition with fast algebraic decay to the singular state $u_+=0$, which causes much strong singularity to the system in the form of $m\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}}\right)_x$, and the other is the degenerate viscous shock with slow algebraic decay to $u_+=0$, which makes less strong singularity to the system. In order to overcome the singularity at $u_+=0$, we technically use the weighted energy method and develop a new strategy where the weights related to the shock waves are carefully selected, while the chosen weights for the non-degenerate case are stronger than the degenerate case. Numerical simulations are also carried out in different cases to illustrate and validate our theoretical results. In particular, we numerically approximate the solution for different value of $0&lt;m&lt;1$, and find that the shapes of shock waves become steeper when the singularity $\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}}\right)_x$ is stronger as $m\rightarrow 0$, which indicates that the effect of singular fast diffusion on the solution is essential.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of a Schr\"odinger equation in dimension one with a nonlinear point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an effective equation for the dynamics of many identical bosons in dimension one in the presence of a tiny impurity. The interaction between every pair of bosons is mediated by the impurity through a positive three-body potential. Assuming a simultaneous mean-field and short-range scaling with the short-range proceeding slower than the mean-field, and choosing an initial fully condensed state, we prove propagation of chaos and obtain an effective one-particle Schr\"odinger equation with a defocusing nonlinearity concentrated at a point. More precisely, we prove convergence of one-particle density operators in the trace-class topology and estimate the fluctuations as superexponential. This is the first derivation of the so-called nonlinear delta model, widely investigated in the last decades.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present difference schemes for stochastic transport equations with low-regularity velocity fields. We establish $L^2$ stability and convergence of the difference approximations under conditions that are less strict than those required for deterministic transport equations. The $L^2$ estimate, crucial for the analysis, is obtained through a discrete duality argument and a comprehensive examination of a class of backward parabolic difference schemes.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>
