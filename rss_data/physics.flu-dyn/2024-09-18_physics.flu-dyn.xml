      <title>New correlations for the interphase drag in the two-fluid model of gas-liquid flows through packed-bed reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding transport phenomena through porous media is essential for applications ranging from water treatment systems to heat pipes. In many of these systems, packed-bed reactors (PBRs) are crucial components, and understanding and quantifying the pressure drop due to flow through the PBR is critical to effective operation. Recent experiments conducted by NASA measured the pressure drop due to gas-liquid flow through a PBR under microgravity conditions. Based on these experiments, we develop correlations for the interphase drag in a two-fluid model (TFM). Specifically, two closure relations are needed for the TFM: the liquid-solid $f_{ls}$ and gas-liquid $f_{gl}$ interphase force. We use an Ergun-type closure for $f_{ls}$. Then, under a 1D flow assumption, the TFM equations are rewritten with $f_{gl}$ as the only unknown. We employ data-driven calculations to determine $f_{gl}$, which we correlate (via composite fits) as a function of the liquid and gas Reynolds numbers, $Re_{l}$ and $Re_{g}$, respectively, and the Suratman number $Su_{l}$. To validate the proposed $f_{gl}(Re_{l},Re_{g},Su_{l})$ closure, we perform two-dimensional (2D) transient, multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations at low $Re_{l}$ and $Re_{g}$ (laminar flow) in ANSYS Fluent employing an Euler-Euler formulation. We find good agreement between the CFD simulations based on the proposed $f_{gl}$ closure and the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Generalized Green-Ampt Approach to 1D Oscillatory Flows in Partially Saturated/Unsaturated Media: Capillary Effects in Beach Hydrodynamics (Semi-analytical &amp; Numerical studies)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-analytical multi-front solutions of water table response due to periodic forcing in a partially saturated vertical porous column are developed, tested and compared to finite volume solutions of the Richards equation. The multi-front solutions are useful for capturing parametrically the frequency response of the vertical column to tidal oscillations while taking into account both capillary and gravitational effects. Vertical oscillations are examined, accounting for unsaturated flow above the oscillating water table as well as saturated flow below it. The multi-front models are conceived as successive generalizations of the Green-Ampt piston flow approach. The single front model is an "inverted" Green Ampt model, with an abrupt front separating the saturated and dry regions. It is adapted to the case of an oscillatory pressure imposed at the bottom of the column (rather than a fixed pressure imposed at the top). The N front models (N&gt;=2) further generalize this concept, using a (Theta(h), K(h)) parametrization to take into account the capillary properties of the unsaturated medium. The resulting systems of ODE's are non linear with time variable coefficients. The solutions obtained for N = 10 fronts are satisfactory both in terms of water table fluctuations and moisture profiles, even for fine grained soils (Guelph Loam). They are computed much faster than space-time discretized solutions of the non linear Richards PDE. For sandy soils, even the 2-front solution (N=2) is satisfactory in terms of water table response Zs(t). The 2-front model itself is a significant improvement on the single front Green-Ampt model, and it appears potentially useful for analyzing the response of unsaturated flow systems under various types of oscillatory and transient forcing. Overall, the N-front method is useful for exploring the frequency response of the water table to tidal forcing.</description>

      <title>OpenACC offloading of the MFC compressible multiphase flow solver on AMD and NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GPUs are the heart of the latest generations of supercomputers. We efficiently accelerate a compressible multiphase flow solver via OpenACC on NVIDIA and AMD Instinct GPUs. Optimization is accomplished by specifying the directive clauses 'gang vector' and 'collapse'. Further speedups of six and ten times are achieved by packing user-defined types into coalesced multidimensional arrays and manual inlining via metaprogramming. Additional optimizations yield seven-times speedup in array packing and thirty-times speedup of select kernels on Frontier. Weak scaling efficiencies of 97% and 95% are observed when scaling to 50% of Summit and 95% of Frontier. Strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 81% are observed when increasing the device count by a factor of 8 and 16 on V100 and MI250X hardware. The strong scaling efficiency of AMD's MI250X increases to 92% when increasing the device count by a factor of 16 when GPU-aware MPI is used for communication.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission of internal waves by a radiative instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous emission of internal waves (IWs) from balanced mesoscale eddies has been previously proposed to provide a source of oceanic IW kinetic energy (KE). This study examines the mechanisms leading to the spontaneous emission of spiral-shaped IWs from an anticyclonic eddy with an order-one Rossby number, using a high-resolution numerical simulation of a flat-bottomed, wind-forced, reentrant channel flow configured to resemble the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. It is demonstrated that IWs are spontaneously generated as a result of a loss of balance process that is concentrated at the eddy edge, and then radiate radially outward. A 2D linear stability analysis of the eddy shows that the spontaneous emission arises from a radiative instability which involves an interaction between a vortex Rossby wave supported by the radial gradient of potential vorticity and an outgoing IWs. This particular instability occurs when the perturbation frequency is superinertial. This finding is supported by a KE analysis of the unstable modes and the numerical solution, where it is shown that the horizontal shear production provides the source of perturbation KE. Furthermore, the horizontal length scale and frequency of the most unstable mode from the stability analysis agree well with those of the spontaneously emitted IWs in the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model of optothermal fluidics in a confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the semi-analytical solution of the temperature and flow fields of a fluid confined in a narrow space between two parallel plates. The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Solving the Hele-Shaw flow using the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm on superconducting devices: A study of efficiency and challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum processors capable of handling practical fluid flow problems represents a distant yet promising frontier. Recent strides in quantum algorithms, particularly linear solvers, have illuminated the path toward quantum solutions for classical fluid flow solvers. However, assessing the capability of these quantum linear systems algorithms (QLSAs) in solving ideal flow equations on real hardware is crucial for their future development in practical fluid flow applications. In this study, we examine the capability of a canonical QLSA, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, in accurately solving the system of linear equations governing an idealized fluid flow problem, specifically the Hele-Shaw flow. Our investigation focuses on analyzing the accuracy and computational cost of the HHL solver. To gauge the stability and convergence of the solver, we conduct shots-based simulations on quantum simulators. Furthermore, we share insights gained from executing the HHL solver on superconducting quantum devices. To mitigate errors arising from qubit measurement, gate operations, and qubit decoherence inherent in quantum devices, we employ various error suppression and mitigation techniques. Our preliminary assessments serve as a foundational step towards enabling more complex quantum utility scale evaluation of using QLSA for solving fluid flow problems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional coherent structures in a curved pipe flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dean's approximation for curved pipe flow, valid under loose coiling and high Reynolds numbers, is extended to study three-dimensional travelling waves. Two distinct types of solutions bifurcate from the Dean's classic two-vortex solution. The first type arises through a supercritical bifurcation from inviscid linear instability, and the corresponding self-consistent asymptotic structure aligns with the vortex-wave interaction theory. The second type emerges from a subcritical bifurcation by curvature-induced instabilities and satisfies the boundary region equations. Despite the subcritical nature of the second type of solutions, it is not possible to connect their solution branches to the zero-curvature limit of the pipe. However, by continuing from known self-sustained exact coherent structures in the straight pipe flow problem, another family of three-dimensional travelling waves can be shown to exist across all Dean numbers. The self-sustained solutions also possess the two high-Reynolds-number limits. While the vortex-wave interaction type of solutions can be computed at large Dean numbers, their branch remains unconnected to the Dean vortex solution branch.</description>

      <title>Optimal trajectories for Bayesian olfactory search in the low information limit and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In turbulent flows, tracking the source of a passive scalar cue requires exploiting the limited information that can be gleaned from rare, randomized encounters with the cue. When crafting a search policy, the most challenging and important decision is what to do in the absence of an encounter. In this work, we perform high-fidelity direct numerical simulations of a turbulent flow with a stationary source of tracer particles, and obtain quasi-optimal policies (in the sense of minimal average search time) with respect to the empirical encounter statistics. We study the trajectories under such policies and compare the results to those of the infotaxis heuristic. In the presence of a strong mean wind, the optimal motion in the absence of an encounter is zigzagging (akin to the well-known insect behavior ``casting'') followed by a return to the starting location. The zigzag motion generates characteristic $t^{1/2}$ scaling of the rms displacement envelope. By passing to the limit where the probability of detection vanishes, we connect these results to the classical linear search problem and derive an estimate of the tail of the arrival time pdf as a stretched exponential $p(T)\sim \exp(-k\sqrt{T})$ for some $k&gt;0,$ in agreement with Monte Carlo results. We also discuss what happens as the wind speed becomes smaller.</description>

      <title>Sticking without contact: Elastohydrodynamic adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adhesion between dry solid surfaces is typically governed by contact forces, involving surface forces and elasticity. For surfaces immersed in a fluid, out-of-contact adhesion arises due to the viscous resistance to the opening of the liquid gap. While the adhesion between dry solids is described by the classical JKR theory, there is no equivalent framework for the wet adhesion of soft solids. Here, we investigate theoretically the viscous adhesion emerging during the separation of a sphere from an elastic substrate. The suction pressure within the thin viscous film between the solids induces significant elastic displacements. Unexpectedly, the elastic substrate closely follows the motion of the sphere, leading to a sticking without contact. The initial dynamics is described using similarity solutions, resulting in a nonlinear adhesion force that grows in time as F ~ t^(2/3). When elastic displacements become large enough, another similarity solution emerges that leads to a violent snap-off of the adhesive contact through a finite-time singularity. The observed phenomenology bears a strong resemblance with JKR theory, and is relevant for a wide range of applications involving viscous adhesion.</description>

      <title>High-order Accurate Entropy Stable Schemes for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Synge-type Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All the existing entropy stable (ES) schemes for relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) in the literature were restricted to the ideal equation of state (EOS), which however is often a poor approximation for most relativistic flows due to its inconsistency with the relativistic kinetic theory. This paper develops high-order ES finite difference schemes for RHD with general Synge-type EOS, which encompasses a range of special EOSs. We first establish an entropy pair for the RHD equations with general Synge-type EOS in any space dimensions. We rigorously prove that the found entropy function is strictly convex and derive the associated entropy variables, laying the foundation for designing entropy conservative (EC) and ES schemes. Due to relativistic effects, one cannot explicitly express primitive variables, fluxes, and entropy variables in terms of conservative variables. Consequently, this highly complicates the analysis of the entropy structure of the RHD equations, the investigation of entropy convexity, and the construction of EC numerical fluxes. By using a suitable set of parameter variables, we construct novel two-point EC fluxes in a unified form for general Synge-type EOS. We obtain high-order EC schemes through linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes. Arbitrarily high-order accurate ES schemes are achieved by incorporating dissipation terms into the EC schemes, based on (weighted) essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions. Additionally, we derive the general dissipation matrix for general Synge-type EOS based on the scaled eigenvectors of the RHD system. We also define a suitable average of the dissipation matrix at the cell interfaces to ensure that the resulting ES schemes can resolve stationary contact discontinuities accurately. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our schemes for RHD with four special EOSs.</description>

      <title>A lattice Boltzmann method for Biot's consolidation model of linear poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biot's consolidation model is a classical model for the evolution of deformable porous media saturated by a fluid and has various interdisciplinary applications. While numerical solution methods to solve poroelasticity by typical schemes such as finite differences, finite volumes or finite elements have been intensely studied, lattice Boltzmann methods for poroelasticity have not been developed yet. In this work, we propose a novel semi-implicit coupling of lattice Boltzmann methods to solve Biot's consolidation model in two dimensions. To this end, we use a single-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for reaction-diffusion equations to solve the Darcy flow and combine it with a recent pseudo-time multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann scheme for quasi-static linear elasticity by Boolakee, Geier and De Lorenzis (2023, DOI: 10.1016/j.cma.2022.115756). The numerical results demonstrate that naive coupling schemes lead to instabilities when the poroelastic system is strongly coupled. However, the newly developed centered coupling scheme using fully explicit and semi-implicit contributions is stable and accurate in all considered cases, even for the Biot--Willis coefficient being one. Furthermore, the numerical results for Terzaghi's consolidation problem and a two-dimensional extension thereof highlight that the scheme is even able to capture discontinuous solutions arising from instantaneous loading.</description>

      <title>On flow disturbances caused by pressure taps in highly elastic flows around a microfluidic cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to characterise the onset of laterally asymmetric flow of viscoelastic solutions around a confined microfluidic cylinder, which was encountered in a recent study [Rodrigues et al., $\textit{J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech.}$ $\textbf{289}$, 104406 (2020)]. To this end, two non-Newtonian fluids were employed in the same micro-geometry. Two microchannels were studied, both with a cylinder of diameter 75 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, aspect ratio (channel height over width) of 0.37 and blockage ratio (cylinder diameter over channel width) of 0.28, differing only on the width of the pressure taps, located 500 $\mathrm{\mu}$m up- and downstream from the respective cylinder face, on opposing walls. The working fluids consist of two poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions: a weakly shear-thinning elastic fluid and an elastic shear-thinning fluid. Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry ($\mathrm{\mu}$PIV) and streak imaging techniques were used to evaluate the flow over a Weissenberg number range: $100\leq Wi\leq500$, while maintaining a low Reynolds number, $Re&lt;1$. The elastic shear-thinning solution showed laterally asymmetric flow past the cylinder with both pressure tap designs, while with the weakly shear-thinning solution asymmetric flow was only observed with the wider pressure tap intake. In both cases, the fluids preferentially chose the cylinder/wall gap opposing the upstream pressure tap, which was found to influence the flow greatly, seemingly associated with time-dependent flow and possibly the lateral flow asymmetry itself. This work brings to light the necessary compromise between optimal pressure tap design for quality pressure measurements and minimal flow interference, due to the increased susceptibility of elastic microfluidic flows to flow perturbations.</description>

Abstract: In Nagib, Chauhan and Monkewitz~\cite{NCM07} we concluded that nearly all available $C_f$ relations for zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers are in remarkable agreement over the entire range $Re_\theta$ $&lt;$ O($10^8$), provided one coefficient is adjusted in each relation by anchoring it to accurate measurements. Regarding the peak of the streamwise turbulence intensity $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$, we conclude here that accurate measurements in flows with $Re_\tau$ $&gt;$ O($10^6$) are required, especially when looking only at the peak $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$ to discriminate between recently proposed trends. We also find remarkable agreement between the three analyses of Monkewitz \cite{M22}, Chen and Sreenivasan \cite{CS22} and Monkewitz and Nagib \cite{MN15}, with some coefficients slightly modified, by underpinning them with the same accurate measurements of $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$ from reliable channel and boundary layer data. All the three analyses conclude that the inner peak of $&lt;uu&gt;^+$ remains finite in the limit of infinite Reynolds number, which is at variance with the unlimited growth of $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$ as $\ln{Re}$ $_\tau$ predicted by the attached eddy model \cite{MM19}. Accurate measurements of high-order moments and the guidance of consistent asymptotic expansions may help clarify the issue at lower $Re_\tau$ values.</description>

      <title>Approximation of sea surface velocity field by fitting surrogate two-dimensional flow to scattered measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12746v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a rapid approximation method is introduced to estimate the sea surface velocity field based on scattered measurements. The method uses a simplified two-dimensional flow model as a surrogate model, which mimics the real submesoscale flow. The proposed approach treats the interpolation of the flow velocities as an optimization problem, aiming to fit the flow model to the scattered measurements. To ensure consistency between the simulated velocity field and the measured values, the boundary conditions in the numerical simulations are adjusted during the optimization process. Additionally, the relevance of quantity and quality of the scattered measurements is assessed, emphasizing the importance of the measurement locations within the domain as well as explaining how these measurements contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the sea surface velocity field approximation. The proposed methodology has been successfully tested in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, leveraging measurements obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) drifters and high-frequency (HF) radar systems. The adaptability of this approach for different domains, measurement types, and conditions implies that it is suitable for real-world submesoscale scenarios where only an approximation of the sea surface velocity field is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Periodically activated physics-informed neural networks for assimilation tasks for three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply physics-informed neural networks to three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a cubic cell with a Rayleigh number of Ra = 10^6 and a Prandtl number of Pr = 0.7 to assimilate the velocity vector field from given temperature fields and vice versa. With the respective ground truth data provided by a direct numerical simulation, we are able to evaluate the performance of the different activation functions applied (sine, hyperbolic tangent and exponential linear unit) and different numbers of neurons (32, 64, 128, 256) for each of the five hidden layers of the multi-layer perceptron. The main result is that the use of a periodic activation function (sine) typically benefits the assimilation performance in terms of the analyzed metrics, correlation with the ground truth and mean average error. The higher quality of results from sine-activated physics-informed neural networks is also manifested in the probability density function and power spectra of the inferred velocity or temperature fields. Regarding the two assimilation directions, the assimilation of temperature fields based on velocities appears to be more challenging in the sense that it exhibits a sharper limit on the number of neurons below which viable assimilation results can not be achieved.</description>

      <title>Laminar planar jets of elastoviscoplastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform numerical simulations of planar jets of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluid (\citet{saramito2007new} model) at low Reynolds number. Three different configurations are considered: $(i)$ EVP jet in EVP ambient fluid, $(ii)$ EVP jet in Newtonian ambient fluid (miscible), and $(iii)$ EVP jet in Newtonian ambient fluid (immiscible). We investigate the effect of the Bingham number, \textit{i.e.} of the dimensionless yield stress of the EVP fluid, on the jet dynamics, and find a good agreement with the scaling for laminar, Newtonian jets for the centerline velocity $u_c/u_0\propto (x/h)^{-1/3}$ and for the jet thickness $\delta_{mom}/h\propto (x/h)^{2/3}$ at small Bingham number. This is lost once substantial regions of the fluid become unyielded, where we find that the spreading rate of the jet and the decay rate of the centerline velocity increase with the Bingham number, due to the regions of unyielded fluid inducing a blockage effect on the jet. The most striking difference among the three configurations we considered is the extent and position of the regions of unyielded fluid: large portions of ambient and jet fluids (in particular, away from the inlet) are unyielded for the EVP jet in EVP ambient fluid, whereas for the other two configurations, the regions of unyielded fluid are limited to the jet, as expected. We derive a power law scaling for the centerline yield variable and confirm it with the results from our numerical simulations. The yield variable determines the transition from the viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid (yielded) to the viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt material (unyielded).</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for the sound generation of bio-inspired flapping wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bio-inspired flapping wings have been extensively studied for their remarkable aerodynamic performance. Recently, their noise emission has attracted growing interest, but a careful analysis of scaling laws for their sound generation is missing. This work presents scaling laws for the sound generation of bio-inspired flapping wings during hovering flight based on the potential flow theory and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy. Direct numerical simulations considering a range of parameters including the Reynolds number, Mach number and wing kinematics confirms that the proposed scaling laws capture the major physics involved and their predictions agree well with the numerical results. The scaling laws can be used as a powerful tool for engineers in the design of micro-aerial vehicles considering both aerodynamics and acoustics performances simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Deformation Dynamics of Nanopores upon Water Imbibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capillarity-driven transport in nanoporous solids is widespread in nature and crucial for modern liquid-infused engineering materials. During imbibition, curved menisci driven by high negative Laplace pressures exert an enormous contractile load on the porous matrix. Due to the challenge of simultaneously monitoring imbibition and deformation with high spatial resolution, the resulting coupling of solid elasticity to liquid capillarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we study water imbibition in mesoporous silica using optical imaging, gravimetry, and high-resolution dilatometry. In contrast to an expected Laplace pressure-induced contraction, we find a square-root-of-time expansion and an additional abrupt length increase when the menisci reach the top surface. The final expansion is absent when we stop the imbibition front inside the porous medium in a dynamic imbibition-evaporation equilibrium, as is typical for transpiration-driven hydraulic transport in plants, especially in trees. These peculiar deformation behaviors are validated by single-nanopore molecular dynamics simulations and described by a continuum model that highlights the importance of expansive surface stresses at the pore walls (Bangham effect) and the buildup or release of contractile Laplace pressures as menisci collectively advance, arrest, or disappear. Our model suggests that these observations apply to any imbibition process in nanopores, regardless of the liquid/solid combination, and that the Laplace contribution upon imbibition is precisely half that of vapor sorption, due to the linear pressure drop associated with viscous flow. Thus, simple deformation measurements can be used to quantify surface stresses and Laplace pressures or transport in a wide variety of natural and artificial porous media.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetized Asteroseismic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified plasmas with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along a horizontal $x$-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical $z$-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, $B_0^2 \sim z^{n+1}$, where $n$ is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: $\Omega^2 \sim K\left(2m+n\right) \left[1 + (1/M_\mathrm{A})^2 (4-2\gamma+\cos^2\theta-3\cos^4\theta)/4 \right]$. Here, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $K$ the wavenumber, $\theta$ the angle the wave-vector makes with the background magnetic field, $M_\mathrm{A}$ the Alfv\'enic Mach number, and $m$ an integer representing the eigenstate. We discuss roles of such an explicit formula in asteroseismology.</description>
