      <title>GCMe: Efficient implementation of Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions for molecular dynamics simulations of soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a pivotal tool for understanding the structure, dynamics, and phase behavior in charged soft matter systems. To explore phenomena across greater length and time scales in MD simulations, molecules are often coarse-grained for better computational performance. However, commonly-used force fields represent particles as hard-core interaction centers with point charges, which often overemphasizes the packing effect and short-range electrostatics, especially in systems with bulky deformable organic molecules and systems with strong coarse-graining. This underscores the need for an efficient soft-core model to physically capture the effective interactions between coarse-grained particles. To this end, we implement a soft-core model uniting the Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions that is phenomenologically equivalent to recent theoretical models. We first parameterize it generically using water as the model solvent. Then, we benchmark its performance in the OpenMM toolkit for different boundary conditions to highlight a computational speedup of up to $34\times$ compared to commonly used force fields and existing implementations. Finally, we demonstrate its utility by investigating how boundary polarizability affects the adsorption behavior of a polyelectrolyte solution on perfectly conducting and nonmetal electrodes.</description>

      <title>Performance assessment of the effective core potentials under the Fermionic neural network: first and second row elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning techniques has driven the emergence of a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo method (referred to as FermiNet), which has manifested high accuracy and strong predictive power in the electronic structure calculations of atoms, molecules as well as some periodic systems. Recently, the implementation of the effective core potential (ECP) scheme in it further facilitates more efficient calculations in practice. But there still lack a more comprehensive assessment on the ECP's performance under the FermiNet. In this work, we set sail to fill this gap by conducting extensive tests on the first two row elements regarding their atomic spectral and molecular properties. Our major finding is that in general the qualities of ECPs have been correctly reflected under the FermiNet, and a more recently built ECP, ccECP, seems to prevail on the overall performance. Meanwhile, a variation of the transferability between different ECPs has also been observed in the results of the hydrides. On the other hand, the high accuracy of the all-electron calculations is hindered by the absence of relativistic effects as one gets to the second row. Meanwhile the numerical instabilities are more often seen in the all-electron calculations, which could be another source of errors. Finally, with more in-depth discussions, we generate possible directions for developing and improving the FermiNet in the near future.</description>

      <title>doped: Python toolkit for robust and repeatable charged defect supercell calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects are a universal feature of crystalline solids, dictating the key properties and performance of many functional materials. Given their crucial importance yet inherent difficulty in measuring experimentally, computational methods (such as DFT and ML/classical force-fields) are widely used to predict defect behaviour at the atomic level and the resultant impact on macroscopic properties. Here we report `doped`, a Python package for the generation, pre-/post-processing and analysis of defect supercell calculations. `doped` has been built to implement the defect simulation workflow in an efficient, user-friendly yet powerful and fully-flexible manner, with the goal of providing a robust general-purpose platform for conducting reproducible calculations of solid-state defect properties.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Diels-Alder Reaction on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of chemical reactions is an anticipated application of quantum computers. Using a Diels-Alder reaction as a test case, in this study we explore the potential applications of quantum algorithms and hardware in investigating chemical reactions. Our specific goal is to calculate the activation barrier of a reaction between ethylene and cyclopentadiene forming a transition state. To achieve this goal, we use quantum algorithms for near-term quantum hardware (entanglement forging and quantum subspace expansion) and classical post-processing (many-body perturbation theory) in concert. We conduct simulations on IBM quantum hardware using up to 8 qubits, and compute accurate activation barriers in the reaction between cyclopentadiene and ethylene by accounting for both static and dynamic electronic correlation. This work illustrates a hybrid quantum-classical computational workflow to study chemical reactions on near-term quantum devices, showcasing the potential of quantum algorithms and hardware in accurately calculating activation barriers.</description>

      <title>The effect of cation-disorder on lithium transport in halide superionic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the chloride-based Li-ion solid electrolytes, Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ (LZC) have emerged as potential candidates due to their affordability, moisture stability, and high ionic conductivity. LZC synthesized by solid-state heating exhibits limited Li-ion conductivity while the mechanochemical ball-milled material is more conductive. In this computational study, we integrate thermodynamic modeling, using cluster-expansion Monte Carlo, and kinetic modeling, using molecular dynamics, to investigate whether cation disorder can be achieved in LZC, and how it affects Li-ion transport. Our results indicate that fast Li-ion conductivity is induced by the activation of Li/vacancy disorder, which itself depends on the degree of Zr disorder. We find that the very high-temperature scale at which equilibrium Zr-disorder can form precludes any equilibrium synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why only non-equilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball milling leads to good conductivity. We identify as the critical mechanism the lack of Li/vacancy disorder near room temperature when Zr is well-ordered. Our simulations further show that the Li/vacancy order-disorder transition temperature is lowered by Zr disorder, which is necessary for creating high Li diffusivity at room temperature. The insights obtained from this study raise a challenge for the large-scale production of these materials and the potential for the long-term stability of their properties.</description>

      <title>Geometric and electronic properties of two kinds of CrO2 magnetic monolayers: D3d and D2h phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the high magnetic coupling strength between the Cr elements, the bulk phase CrO2 is one of several ferromagnetic oxides known to have the highest Curie temperature. When the dimensionality of the material is reduced from 3D to 2D, the 2D CrO2 system material is expected to maintain a high Curie temperature. In this work, we predict two new phases of CrO2 monolayer (D3d and D2h) by using first-principles calculations. We have found that the Curie temperature of 2D CrO2 is much lower than that of its bulk phase, but still remains as high as 191K, which is comparable to that of Fe2Cr2Ge6. In addition, 1L D3d-CrO2 is in the ferromagnetic state, while 1L D2h-CrO2 is in the antiferromagnetic state. Also, the different geometric structure affects its electrical properties: the 1L D3d-CrO2 is a half-metal while 1L D2h-CrO2 is a semiconductor. Our studies have shown that there is a wealth of electrical and magnetic properties in CrO2.</description>

      <title>Criticality in an imidazolium ionic liquid fully wetting a sapphire support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Ionic liquids have various applications in catalytic reaction environments. In those systems, their interaction with interfaces is key to their performance as a liquid phase. We hypothesize that the way a monolayer ionic liquid phase interacts with interfaces like a sapphire substrate is significantly dependent on temperature and that critical behavior can be observed in the structural properties of the liquid film.
  Methods and simulations: We perform molecular dynamics simulations of imidazolium-based ionic liquid monolayers deposited on a sapphire substrate at temperatures from 200K to 400K. We develop computational tools to analyze structural properties of molecular arrangement in the monolayer, the structure of the film and the defects spontaneously forming and healing.
  Findings: We observe a clear structural phase transition at around 300K from a solid-like to a liquid-like behavior of a film. Below the critical point an alternating crystalline structure of cations and anions with alignment of periodic vectors with the underlying substrate grid is observed, with frozen defects. Above the critical temperature, the pattern becomes isotropic within the contact layer that displays dynamic defects of a characteristic size. Our results highlight the importance of confinement to the phase behavior of the system.</description>

      <title>A Physics-driven GraphSAGE Method for Physical Process Simulations Described by Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have successfully addressed various computational physics problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs). However, while tackling issues related to irregularities like singularities and oscillations, trained solutions usually suffer low accuracy. In addition, most current works only offer the trained solution for predetermined input parameters. If any change occurs in input parameters, transfer learning or retraining is required, and traditional numerical techniques also need an independent simulation. In this work, a physics-driven GraphSAGE approach (PD-GraphSAGE) based on the Galerkin method and piecewise polynomial nodal basis functions is presented to solve computational problems governed by irregular PDEs and to develop parametric PDE surrogate models. This approach employs graph representations of physical domains, thereby reducing the demands for evaluated points due to local refinement. A distance-related edge feature and a feature mapping strategy are devised to help training and convergence for singularity and oscillation situations, respectively. The merits of the proposed method are demonstrated through a couple of cases. Moreover, the robust PDE surrogate model for heat conduction problems parameterized by the Gaussian random field source is successfully established, which not only provides the solution accurately but is several times faster than the finite element method in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Density Response and Local Field Factor of Warm Dense Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present quasi-exact ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the partial static density responses and local field factors of hydrogen in the warm dense matter regime, from solid density conditions to the strongly compressed case. The full dynamic treatment of electrons and protons on the same footing allows us to rigorously quantify both electronic and ionic exchange--correlation effects in the system, and to compare with earlier incomplete models such as the archetypal uniform electron gas [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 235001 (2020)] or electrons in a fixed ion snapshot potential [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 066402 (2022)] that do not take into account the interplay between the two constituents. The full electronic density response is highly sensitive to electronic localization around the ions, and our results constitute unambiguous predictions for upcoming X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments with hydrogen jets and fusion plasmas. All PIMC results are made freely available and can directly be used for a gamut of applications, including inertial confinement fusion calculations and the modelling of dense astrophysical objects. Moreover, they constitute invaluable benchmark data for approximate but computationally less demanding approaches such as density functional theory or PIMC within the fixed-node approximation.</description>

      <title>A generalized hybrid method for surfactant dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generalized hybrid method for both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) surfactant dynamics. While the Navier-Stokes equations are solved by the Eulerian method, the surfactant transport is tracked by a Lagrangian particle method, in which the remeshing technique is employed to prevent particle clustering. For the mass redistribution during remeshing, the redistribution weight is selected with weighted least squares, which shares the theoretical basis of the moving least squares method (MLS) and enables the present hybrid method to work in both 2-D and 3-D cases. This optimized mass redistribution effectively strengthens the robustness of the present hybrid method, as validated by 2-D topological changes of the dumbbell. The conservation, accuracy, and convergence of the present hybrid method have also been validated with both 2-D and 3-D test cases, including a translation circle/sphere, a deformed circle/sphere in the shear flow, and droplet deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a plasma sheath forms next to a dielectric wall, material properties determine electron absorption and reflection from the surface, impacting the sheath formation and structure. The low energy regime of this interaction is often not considered rigorously in emissive sheath simulations, but may be modeled from quantum mechanical first principles, and has important applications to plasma thrusters and fusion devices. In this work, low energy electron reflection from the wall is implemented as a boundary condition in a continuum kinetic framework and the sheath is simulated for dielectric material parameters in high and low emission cases. The results presented here demonstrate that the material parameters can have significant effect on the resulting sheath profile and particle distribution functions. Surfaces with high reflection rates see the formation of a space-charge limited sheath.</description>

      <title>Quantum Control of Radical Pair Dynamics beyond Time-Local Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We realize arbitrary waveform-based control of spin-selective recombination reactions of radical pairs in the low magnetic field regime. To this end, we extend the Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) paradigm to allow for optimizing reaction yields. This overcomes drawbacks of previously suggested time-local optimization approaches for the reaction control of radical pairs, which were limited to high biasing fields. We demonstrate how efficient time-global optimization of the recombination yields can be realized by gradient based methods augmented by time-blocking, sparse sampling of the yield, and evaluation of the central single time-step propagators and their Fr\'echet derivatives using iterated Trotter-Suzuki splittings. Results are shown for both a toy model, previously used to demonstrate coherent control of radical pair reactions in the simpler high-field scenario, and furthermore for a realistic exciplex-forming donor-acceptor system comprising 16 nuclear spins. This raises prospects for the spin-control of actual radical pair systems in ambient magnetic fields, by suppressing or boosting radical reaction yields using purpose-specific radio-frequency waveforms, paving the way for reaction-yield-dependent quantum magnetometry and potentially applications of quantum control to biochemical radical pair reactions. We demonstrate the latter aspect for two radical pairs implicated in quantum biology.</description>

      <title>Native point defects in HgCdTe infrared detector material: Identifying deep centers from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the native point defects in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) detector material Hg$_{0.75}$Cd$_{0.25}$Te using a dielectric-dependent hybrid density functional combined with spin-orbit coupling. Characterizing these point defects is essential as they are responsible for intrinsic doping and nonradiative recombination centers in the detector material. The dielectric-dependent hybrid functional allows for an accurate description of the band gap ($E_g$) for Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Te (MCT) over the entire compositional range, a level of accuracy challenging with standard hybrid functionals. Our comprehensive examination of the native point defects confirms that cation vacancies $V_\text{Hg(Cd)}$ are the primary sources of $p$-type conductivity in the LWIR material given their low defect formation energies and the presence of a shallow acceptor level ($-$/0) near the valence-band maximum (VBM). In addition to the shallow acceptor level, the cation vacancies exhibit a deep charge transition level (2$-$/$-$) situated near the midgap, characteristic of nonradiative recombination centers. Our results indicate that Hg interstitial could also be a deep center in the LWIR MCT through a metastable configuration under the Hg-rich growth conditions. While an isolated Te antisite does not show deep levels, the formation of $V_\text{Hg}$-Te$_\text{Hg}$ defect complex introduces a deep acceptor level within the band gap.</description>

Abstract: We present analytical and numerical solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the scattered wavefunctions generated by confocal parabolic billiards and parabolic segments with various $\delta$-type potential-strength functions. The analytical expressions are expressed as summations of products of parabolic cylinder functions $D_m$. We numerically investigate the resonances and tunneling in the confocal parabolic billiards by employing an accurate boundary wall method that provides a complete inside-outside picture. The criterion for discretizing the parabolic sides of the billiard is explained in detail. We discuss the phenomenon of transparency at certain eigenenergies.</description>
