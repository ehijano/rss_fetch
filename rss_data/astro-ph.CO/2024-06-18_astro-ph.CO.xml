      <title>Reducing Model Error Using Optimised Galaxy Selection: Weak Lensing Cluster Mass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are one of the most powerful probes to study extensions of General Relativity and the Standard Cosmological Model. Upcoming surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time are expected to revolutionise the field, by enabling the analysis of cluster samples of unprecedented size and quality. To reach this era of high-precision cluster cosmology, the mitigation of sources of systematic error is crucial. A particularly important challenge is bias in cluster mass measurements induced by inaccurate photometric redshift estimates of source galaxies. This work proposes a method to optimise the source sample selection in cluster weak lensing analyses drawn from wide-field survey lensing catalogs to reduce the bias on reconstructed cluster masses. We use a combinatorial optimisation scheme and methods from variational inference to select galaxies in latent space to produce a probabilistic galaxy source sample catalog for highly accurate cluster mass estimation. We show that our method reduces the critical surface mass density $\Sigma_{\rm crit}$ modelling bias on the 60-70% level, while maintaining up to 90% of galaxies. We highlight that our methodology has applications beyond cluster mass estimation as an approach to jointly combine galaxy selection and model inference under sources of systematics.</description>

      <title>Constraining modified gravity with weak lensing peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that maximizing the information extracted from upcoming and ongoing stage-IV weak-lensing surveys requires higher-order summary statistics that complement the standard two-point statistics. In this work, we focus on weak-lensing peak statistics to test two popular modified gravity models, $f(R)$ and nDGP, using the FORGE and BRIDGE weak-lensing simulations, respectively. From these simulations we measure the peak statistics as a function of both cosmological and modified gravity parameters simultaneously. Our findings indicate that the peak abundance is sensitive to the strength of modified gravity, while the peak two-point correlation function is sensitive to the nature of the screening mechanism in a modified gravity model. We combine these simulated statistics with a Gaussian Process Regression emulator and a Gaussian likelihood to generate stage-IV forecast posterior distributions for the modified gravity models. We demonstrate that, in a systematics-free case, peak statistics can constrain $\log_{10}(f_{R0}) = -6$ to 2% precision, and $\log_{10}(H_0 r_c) = 0.5$ to 25% precision. Finally, we find that our weakest models, $\log_{10}(f_{R0})$ &lt; 6.17 and $\log_{10}(H_0 r_c)$ &gt; 1, can be ruled out at the two sigma level with an area of $300 \rm{deg}^2$ and $1000 \rm{deg}^2$, respectively, with the upcoming stage-IV data.</description>

      <title>Be careful in multi-messenger inference of the Hubble constant: A path forward for robust inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) are a direct probe of the expansion history of the universe and carry the potential to shed light on the disparity between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. To measure the value of $H_0$ with such observations requires pristine inference of the luminosity distance and the true source redshift with minimal impact from systematics. In this analysis, we carry out joint inference on mock gravitational wave (GW) signals and their electromagnetic (EM) afterglows from BNS coalescences and find that the inclination angle inferred from the afterglow light curve and apparent superluminal motion can be precise, but need not be accurate and is subject to systematic uncertainty that could be as large as $1.5\sigma$. This produces a disparity between the EM and GW inferred inclination angles, which if not carefully treated when combining observations can bias the inferred value of $H_0$. We also find that already small misalignments of $3^{\circ}-6^{\circ}$ between the inherent system inclinations for the GW and EM emission can bias the inference by $\mathcal{O}(1-2\sigma)$ if not taken into account. As multi-messenger BNS observations are rare, we must make the most out of a small number of events and harness the increased precision, while avoiding reduced accuracy. We demonstrate how to mitigate these potential sources of bias by jointly inferring the mismatch between the GW- and EM-based inclination angles and $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Weak-Lensing Shear-Selected Galaxy Clusters from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program: I. Cluster Catalog, Selection Function and Mass--Observable Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first step towards deriving cosmological constraints through the abundances of galaxy clusters selected in a $510\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ weak-lensing aperture mass map, constructed with the Year-Three shear catalog from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. We adopt a conservative source galaxy selection to construct a sample of $129$ weak-lensing peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio above $4.7$. We use semi-analytical injection simulations to derive the selection function and the mass--observable relation of our sample. These results take into account complicated uncertainties associated with weak-lensing measurements, such as the non-uniform survey depth and the complex survey geometry, projection effects from uncorrelated large-scale structures, and the intrinsic alignment of source galaxies. We also propose a novel modeling framework to make parts of the mass--observable relation insensitive to assumed cosmological parameters. Such a framework not only offers a great computational advantage to cosmological studies, but can also benefit future astrophysical studies using shear-selected clusters. Our results are an important step towards utilizing these cluster samples that are constructed nearly independent of any baryonic assumptions in upcoming deep-and-wide lensing surveys from the Vera Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing Shear-selected Galaxy Clusters from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program: II. Cosmological Constraints from the Cluster Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints using the abundance of weak-lensing shear-selected galaxy clusters in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. The clusters are selected on the mass maps constructed using the three-year (Y3) weak-lensing data with an area of $\approx500~$deg$^2$, resulting in a sample size of $129$ clusters with high signal-to-noise ratios $\nu$ of $\nu\geq4.7$. Owing to the deep, wide-field, and uniform imaging of the HSC survey, this is by far the largest sample of shear-selected clusters, in which the selection solely depends on gravity and is free from any assumptions about the dynamical state. Informed by the optical counterparts, the shear-selected clusters span a redshift range of $z\lesssim0.7$ with a median of $z\approx0.3$. The lensing sources are securely selected at $z\gtrsim0.7$ with a median of $z\approx1.3$, leading to nearly zero cluster member contamination. We carefully account for (1) the bias in the photometric redshift of sources, (2) the bias and scatter in the weak-lensing mass using a simulation-based calibration, and (3) the measurement uncertainty that is directly estimated on the mass maps using an injection-based method developed in a companion paper (Chen et al. submitted). In a blind analysis, the fully marginalized posteriors of the cosmological parameters are obtained as $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}} = 0.50^{+0.28}_{-0.24}$, $\sigma_8 = 0.685^{+0.161}_{-0.088}$, $\hat{S}_{8}\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3\right)^{0.25} = 0.835^{+0.041}_{-0.044}$, and $\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3} = 0.993^{+0.084}_{-0.126}$ in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We compare our cosmological constraints with other studies, including those based on cluster abundances, galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering, and Cosmic Microwave Background observed by $Planck$, and find good agreement at levels of $\lesssim2\sigma$.

      <title>Density Fluctuations in the Intracluster Medium: An Attempt to Constrain Viscosity with Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of viscosity in the Intracluster Medium (ICM) is still an open question in astrophysics. To address this problem, we have run a set of cosmological simulations of three galaxy clusters with a mass larger than $M_{\mathrm{Vir}} &gt; 10^{15} $M$_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ using the SPMHD-code OpenGadget3. We aim to quantify the influence of viscosity and constrain its value in the ICM. Our results show significant morphological differences at small scales, temperature variations, and density fluctuations induced by viscosity. We observe a suppression of instabilities at small scales, resulting in a more filamentary structure and a larger amount of small structures due to the lack of mixing with the medium. The conversion from kinetic to internal energy leads to an increase of the virial temperature of the cluster of $\sim$5% - 10%, while the denser regions remain cold. The amplitude of density fluctuations is found to increase with viscosity, as well as the velocity fluctuations. However, comparison with observational data indicates consistency with observed density fluctuations, challenging the direct constraint of viscosity solely through density fluctuations. Furthermore, the ratio of density to velocity fluctuations remains close to 1 regardless of the amount of viscosity, in agreement with the theoretical expectations. Our results show for the first time in a cosmological simulation of a galaxy cluster the effect of viscosity in the ICM, a study that is currently missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Modeling optical systematics for the Taurus CMB experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate a variety of optical systematics for Taurus, a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation experiment, to assess their impact on large-scale E-mode polarisation measurements and constraints of the optical depth to reionisation {\tau}. We model a one-month flight of Taurus from Wanaka, New Zealand aboard a super-pressure balloon (SPB). We simulate night-time scans of both the CMB and dust foregrounds in the 150GHz band, one of Taurus's four observing bands. We consider a variety of possible systematics that may affect Taurus's observations, including non-gaussian beams, pointing reconstruction error, and half-wave plate (HWP) non-idealities. For each of these, we evaluate the residual power in the difference between maps simulated with and without the systematic, and compare this to the expected signal level corresponding to Taurus's science goals. Our results indicate that most of the HWP-related systematics can be mitigated to be smaller than sample variance by calibrating with Planck's TT spectrum and using an achromatic HWP model, with a preference for five layers of sapphire to ensure good systematic control. However, additional beam characterization will be required to mitigate far-sidelobe pickup from dust on larger scales.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low frequency LOFAR spectral indices of cluster radio halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fraction of galaxy clusters harbor diffuse radio sources known as radio halos. The currently adopted scenario for their formation is based on second-order Fermi re-acceleration of seed electrons that is driven by merger-driven turbulence in the intra-cluster medium. This mechanism is expected to be inefficient, which implies that a significant fraction of halos should have very steep ($\alpha &lt; -1.5$) energy spectra. We start investigating the potential and current limitations of the combination of the two surveys conducted by LOFAR, LoTSS (144 MHz) and LoLSS (54 MHz), to probe the origin of radio halos. We follow up the 20 radio halos detected in the DR1 of LoTSS, which covers the HETDEX field, with the LoLSS survey, and we study their spectral properties between 54 and 144 MHz. After the removal of compact sources, 9 halos were excluded due to unreliable halo flux density measurements at 54 MHz. Our main finding is that 7 out of 11 ($\sim$ 64%) exhibit an ultra-steep spectrum ($\alpha &lt; -1.5$), which is a key prediction of turbulent re-acceleration models. We also note a tentative trend for more massive systems to host flatter halos, although the currently poor statistics does not allow for a deeper analysis. Our sample suffers from low angular resolution at 54 MHz, which limits the accuracy of the compact-sources subtraction. Nevertheless, this study is the first step towards providing compelling evidence for the existence of a large fraction of radio halos with very steep spectrum, which is a fundamental prediction of turbulent re-acceleration models. In this regard, the forthcoming second data release of LoLSS, along with the integration of LOFAR international stations and the instrumental upgrade to LOFAR2.0, will improve both the statistics and the low-frequency angular resolution, allowing to conclusively determine the origin of radio halos in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Precisely Measuring the Cosmic Reionization History from IGM Damping Wings Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing the IGM damping wings imprinted on the proximity zones of quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whereas past work has typically forgone the additional constraining power afforded by the blue side continuum ($1216\,\r{A} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1280\,\r{A}$) and/or opted not to model the large correlated IGM transmission fluctuations in the proximity zone ($\lambda \lesssim 1216\,\r{A}$), we construct a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum accounting for all sources of error - the stochasticity induced by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, the unknown intrinsic spectrum of the quasar, and spectral noise. This principled Bayesian method allows us to marginalize out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar's radiation and its unknown intrinsic spectrum to precisely measure the IGM neutral fraction, $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$. A key element of our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) to describe the intrinsic quasar spectrum via a small number of nuisance parameters. Using a large sample of $15,559$ SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z \gtrsim 2.15$ we trained and quantified the performance of six distinct DR methods, and find that a six parameter PCA model (five coefficients plus a normalization) performs best, with complex machine learning approaches providing no advantage. By conducting statistical inference on 100 realistic mock EoR quasar spectra, we demonstrate the reliability of the credibility contours that we obtain on $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$ and the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$. The new method introduced here will transform IGM damping wings into a precision probe of reionization, on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Precision of IGM Damping Wing Measurements Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the precision with which the Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wing signature imprinted on the spectra of high-redshift quasars (QSOs) by the foreground neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) can measure the history of cosmic reionization. We leverage a novel inference pipeline based on a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum (both red- and blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line), accounting for all relevant sources of uncertainty - the stochasticity caused by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, it's unknown intrinsic spectrum, and spectral noise. Performing fast JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) parameter inference, we precisely measure the underlying global IGM neutral fraction as well as the lifetime of the quasar. Running a battery of tests on over a thousand mocks, we find optimal precision when running the pipeline with a six parameter PCA continuum model (five coefficients and a normalization) on $\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{N} \sim 10$ spectra, binned to a $\sim 500\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ velocity pixel scale, and extending at least out to the C IV $\lambda\,1549\,\text{\r{A}}$ emission line. After marginalizing out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar continuum, a single spectrum constrains the IGM neutral fraction to $28.0_{-8.8}^{+8.2}\,\%$ and the quasar lifetime to $0.80_{-0.55}^{+0.22}\,\mathrm{dex}$, improving notably towards spectra with a stronger IGM damping wing imprint. Higher precision can be achieved by averaging over statistical quasar samples. We identify two primary sources of uncertainty that contribute approximately equally to the total error budget: the uncertain quasar continuum model and the stochastic distribution of neutral regions arising from both the reionization topology and the location of the quasar's ionization front.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the cosmic microwave backgroundradiation are described to remarkable accuracy by the six-parameterLambda CDM cosmology. However, the key ingredients of this model, namely dark matter, dark energy and cosmic inflation are not understood at a fundamental level. It is therefore important to investigate tensions between the CMB and other cosmological probes. I will review aspects of tensions with direct measurements of the Hubble constant H_0, measurements of weak gravitational lensing, and the recent hints of evolving dark energy reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (I) Large Scale Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with a mass greater than a few grams and sub-micrometer size, formed during the quark-hadron transition. Originating from the axion field, they offer a possible resolution of the similarity between visible and dark components of the Universe. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and resulting in pervasive electromagnetic radiation throughout the Universe. This work aims to predict the electromagnetic signature in large-scale structures from the AQN-baryon interaction, accounting for thermal and non-thermal radiations. We use Magneticum hydrodynamical simulations to describe the distribution and dynamics of gas and dark matter at cosmological scales. We calculate the electromagnetic signature from radio, starting at $\nu \sim$ 1 GHz, up to a few keV X-ray energies. We find that the AQNs signature is characterized by monopole and fluctuation signals. The amplitude of both signals strongly depends on the average AQN mass and the ionization level of the baryonic environment. We identify a most optimistic scenario with a signal often near the sensitivity limit of existing instruments, such as FIRAS and the South Pole Telescope for high-resolution. Fluctuations in the Extra-galactic Background Light caused by the AQN can be tested with space-based imagers Euclid and James Webb Space Telescope. We also identify a minimal configuration, still out of reach of existing instruments, but future experiments might be able to pose constraints on the AQN model. We conclude that this is a viable dark matter model, which does not violate the canons of cosmology, nor existing observations. The best chances for testing this model reside in 1) ultra-deep IR and optical surveys, 2) spectral distorsions of the CMB and 3) low-frequency (1 GHz &lt; $\nu $ &lt; 100 GHz) and high-resolution ($\ell &gt; 10^4$) observations.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) of stellar mass or heavier would accrete baryonic gas, which becomes denser and hotter, injecting energetic photons in the cosmological medium soon after cosmic recombination, in the so-called dark ages. The ionisation history of the universe would be altered, an effect cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarisation anisotropies is sensitive to. The magnitude of the effect depends on the abundance and mass distribution of the PBHs, as well as on still uncertain aspects of accretion luminosity. We review the current understanding of this field, with an emphasis on the peculiarities of the phenomenon in the cosmological context, and present the existing constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Cosmology from galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing in harmonic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the joint tomographic analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering in harmonic space, using galaxy catalogues from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3). We utilise the redMaGiC and MagLim catalogues as lens galaxies and the METACALIBRATION catalogue as source galaxies. The measurements of angular power spectra are performed using the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method, and our theoretical modelling follows the fiducial analyses performed by DES Y3 in configuration space, accounting for galaxy bias, intrinsic alignments, magnification bias, shear magnification bias and photometric redshift uncertainties. We explore different approaches for scale cuts based on non-linear galaxy bias and baryonic effects contamination. Our fiducial covariance matrix is computed analytically, accounting for mask geometry in the Gaussian term, and including non-Gaussian contributions and super-sample covariance terms. To validate our harmonic space pipelines and covariance matrix, we used a suite of 1800 log-normal simulations. We also perform a series of stress tests to gauge the robustness of our harmonic space analysis. In the $\Lambda$CDM model, the clustering amplitude $S_8 =\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ is constrained to $S_8 = 0.704\pm 0.029$ and $S_8 = 0.753\pm 0.024$ ($68\%$ C.L.) for the redMaGiC and MagLim catalogues, respectively. For the $w$CDM, the dark energy equation of state is constrained to $w = -1.28 \pm 0.29$ and $w = -1.26^{+0.34}_{-0.27}$, for redMaGiC and MagLim catalogues, respectively. These results are compatible with the corresponding DES Y3 results in configuration space and pave the way for harmonic space analyses using the DES Y6 data.</description>

      <title>A Trifecta of Modelling Tools: Navigating COMPAS, Shark and Bayesian Inference for Binary Black Hole Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have revealed surprising properties of binary black hole (BBH) populations, but there is still mystery surrounding how these compact objects evolve. We apply Bayesian inference and an efficient method to calculate the BBH merger rates in the Shark host galaxies, to determine the combination of COMPAS parameters that outputs a population most like the GW sources from the LVK transient catalogue. For our COMPAS models, we calculate the likelihood with and without the dependence on the predicted number of BBH merger events. We find strong correlations between hyper-parameters governing the specific angular momentum (AM) of mass lost during mass transfer, the mass-loss rates of Wolf--Rayet stars via winds and the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) formation channel. We conclude that analysing the marginalised and unmarginalised likelihood is a good indicator of whether the population parameters distribution and number of observed events reflect the LVK data. In doing so, we see that the majority of the models preferred in terms of the population-level parameters of the BBHs greatly overpredict the number of events we should have observed to date. Looking at the smaller number of models which perform well with both likelihoods, we find that those with no CHE, AM loss occurring closer to the donor during the first mass-transfer event, and/or higher rates of mass-loss from Wolf--Rayet winds are generally preferred by current data. We find these conclusions to be robust to our choice of selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Refining Galactic primordial black hole evaporation constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential dark matter (DM) candidates, particularly focusing on light asteroid-mass PBHs. These PBHs are expected to emit particles through Hawking evaporation that can generate cosmic rays (CRs), eventually producing other secondary radiations through their propagation in the Milky Way, in addition to prompt emissions. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of CR signals resulting from PBH evaporation, incorporating the full CR transport to account for reacceleration and diffusion effects within the Milky Way. In particular, we revisit the $e^\pm$ flux produced by PBHs, using Voyager 1, and study for the first time the diffuse X-ray emission from the up-scattering of Galactic ambient photons due to PBH-produced $e^\pm$ via the inverse Compton effect using XMM-Newton data, as well as the morphological information of the diffuse 511 keV line measured by INTEGRAL/SPI. In doing so, we provide leading constraints on the fraction of DM that can be in form of PBHs in a conservative way, whilst also testing how different assumptions on spin and mass distributions affect our conclusions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a search strategy for MeV-scale feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) at the $e^+e^-$ collider.

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>The Absolute Age of NGC 3201 derived from Detached Eclipsing Binaries and the Hess Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 3201 using $10,000$ sets of theoretical isochrones constructed through Monte Carlo simulation using the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program. These isochrones take into consideration of uncertainty introduced by the choice of stellar evolution parameters. We fit isochrones with 3 detached eclipsing binaries and obtained an age independent of distance. We also fit isochrones with differential reddening corrected HST photometry data utilizing two different Hess diagram based fitting methods. Results from 3 different methods analyzing 2 different types of data agree to within $1 \sigma$, and we find the absolute age of NGC 3201 $= 11.85 \pm 0.74$ Gyr. We also perform variable importance analysis to study the uncertainty contribution from individual parameters and we find the distance is the dominance source of uncertainty in photometry based analysis while total metallicity, Helium abundance, $\alpha$-element abundance, mixing length, and treatment of helium diffusion are important source of uncertainties for all 3 methods.</description>

      <title>Projected gravitational wave constraints on primordial black hole abundance for extended mass distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the projected minimum constraints set by next-generation gravitational wave detectors Einstein Telescope and LISA on the abundance of primordial black holes relative to dark matter for extended primordial black hole mass distributions. We consider broad power law distributions for a range of negative and positive exponents $\gamma$ and use the IMRPhenomXAS waveforms to simulate binary sources up to mass ratios $q = 1000$ and redshifts $z=300$. Our results show that power law mass distributions loosen the $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ constraint for increasing power law exponents, suggesting that extended distributions do not help in evading existing constraints. Interestingly, very negative values of $\gamma$ yield constraints close to ones derived from a monochromatic distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings from Tribrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a class of supersymmetric inflation models where the scalar component of a matter superfield, or a $D$-flat direction of matter fields, drives inflation. Similar to Hybrid inflation, the end of inflation is reached when a "waterfall field", which was stabilized during inflation at a field value where the scalar potential features a large vacuum energy, starts rapidly rolling towards its minimum where a symmetry group $G$ is spontaneously broken. In contrast to standard supersymmetric Hybrid inflation, where the inflaton is a gauge singlet, in Tribrid inflation it can be a gauge non-singlet, which, via its vacuum expectation value, already breaks the gauge symmetry. This raises the question whether topological defects can still form after inflation in this class of models, and if so, which types of defects are generated. We investigate this question systematically in realisations of Tribrid inflation where $G = U(1)$ and we analyse under which conditions cosmic strings form. We find that in the considered cases where domain walls form, these are only temporary and do not invalidate the model realisations. We also discuss how our results can be used to analyse models of Tribrid inflation associated with the final step of $SO(10)$ breaking, where cosmic strings can be metastable and provide a promising explanation of the recent PTA results hinting at a stochastic gravitational wave background at nanohertz frequencies.</description>

Abstract: We study Dark Matter production during first order phase transitions from bubble-plasma collisions. We focus on scenarios where the Dark Matter sector is secluded and its interaction with the visible sector (including the Standard Model) originates from dimension-five and dimension-six operators. We find that such DM is generally heavy and has a large initial velocity, leading to the possibility of DM being warm today. We differentiate between the cases of weakly and strongly coupled dark sectors, where, in the latter case, we focus on glueball DM, which turns out to have very distinct phenomenological properties. We also systematically compute the Freeze-In production of the dark sector and compare it with the bubble-plasma DM abundances.</description>

      <title>$F(Q)$ gravity with Gauss-Bonnet corrections: from early-time inflation to late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the $f(Q)$ gravity with a non-metricity scalar $Q$, the curvatures in Einstein's gravity, that is, the Riemann curvature constructed from the standard Levi-Civita connection, could not be excluded or naturally appear. The first observation is that even in $f(Q)$ gravity, the conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor is not described by the covariant derivatives in the non-metricity gravity but that is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The commutator of the covariant derivatives in Einstein's gravity inevitably induces the Riemann curvature. There is no symmetry nor principle which prohibits the Riemann curvature in non-metricity gravity. Based on this observation, we propose and investigate $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal{G}$ and its generalisations. We show how $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ models realising any given the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime can be reconstructed. We apply the reconstruction formalism to cosmology. Explicitly, the gravity models which realise slow roll or constant roll inflation, dark energy epoch as well as the unification of the inflation and dark energy are found. The dynamical autonomous system and the gravitational wave in the theory under investigation are discussed. It is found the condition that the de Sitter spacetime becomes the (stable) fixed point of the system.</description>

      <title>Dark energy with a shift-symmetric scalar field: obstacles, loophole hunting and dead ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a scalar field being the fundamental description of dark energy without the need of self-tuning any parameter. Thereby, we focus on shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories satisfying also that the propagation speed of gravitational waves is equal to the speed of light. Analysing the stability of scalar linear perturbations, we discuss the conditions that seems to be necessary to describe (super) accelerated cosmic expansion without introducing instabilities. It has been established, however, that this stability can be ruined when taking into account the interaction with tensor perturbations (essentially gravitational waves). Indeed, although we shall point out that the standard proof of absence of dark energy stable braiding models due to this interaction has a possible way-out, we find general arguments suggesting that there are no dark energy stable solutions that can exploit this loophole. Thus, we discuss future research directions for finding viable fundamental descriptions of dark energy. We also provide a dictionary between the covariant version of the scalar field theory and that of the Effective Field Theory approach, explicitly computing the parameters in the latter formalism in terms of the functions appearing in the covariant version, and its derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these expressions are explicitly obtained up-to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Percolating Cosmic String Networks from Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new mechanism, whose ingredients are realised in string compactifications, for the formation of cosmic (super)string networks. Oscillating string loops grow when their tension $\mu$ decreases with time. If $2H + \dot{\mu}/\mu &lt; 0$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter, loops grow faster than the scale factor and an initial population of isolated small loops (for example, produced by nucleation) can grow, percolate and form a network. This condition is satisfied for fundamental strings in the background of a kinating volume modulus rolling towards the asymptotic large volume region of moduli space. Such long kination epochs are motivated in string cosmology by both the electroweak hierarchy problem and the need to solve the overshoot problem. The tension of such a network today is set by the final vacuum; for phenomenologically appealing Large Volume Scenario (LVS) vacua, this would lead to a fundamental string network with $G \mu \sim 10^{-10}$.</description>

      <title>Viscous Unified Dark Matter Models Under Scrutiny: Uncovering Inconsistencies from Dynamical System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscous unified dark matter models aim to describe the dark sector of the Universe, as the dark matter fluid itself gives rise to an accelerated expansion due to a negative bulk viscous pressure. However, in most studies, radiation is often disregarded as a minor factor in dynamical system analyses, overlooking whether radiation domination is achievable. In this paper, we rigorously examine this critical aspect for common parameterizations of bulk viscosity, denoted as $\xi$, within two general classes of viscous unified models. Our findings reveal significant inconsistencies in models where $\xi \propto H^{1-2s} \rho_{m}^{s}$ with $s\leq 0$, and surprisingly, in models where $\xi \propto \rho_{m}^{s}$ with exponents $s&lt;0$, as they both fail to produce a radiation-dominated era. Moreover, the exponent $s$ must lye within the interval $0 \leq s &lt; 1/2$ for the latter model to correctly describes the cosmological evolution. These results underscore the need of including these constraints as a prior in statistical analyses of observational data, with implications for current statistical inferences for the second model, where both prior and best-fit values of $s$ often fall outside the acceptable range.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter Radio Signal from the Milky Way Electron Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>Rapidly growing primordial black holes as seeds of the massive high-redshift JWST Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\gtrsim 7$ have been recently detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form so early within the framework of standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work, we propose that this puzzle can be explained by the presence of some primordial black holes (PBHs) with a mass of $\sim 1000 M_\odot$. These PBHs, clothed in dark matter halo and undergoing super-Eddington accretion, serve as seeds for the early galaxy formation with masses of $\sim 10^{8}-10^{10}~M_\odot$ at high redshift, thus accounting for the JWST observations. Using a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to constrain the PBH mass distribution models, we find that the Lognormal model with $M_{\rm c}\sim 750M_\odot$ is preferred over other hypotheses. These rapidly growing BHs are expected to emit strong radiation and may appear as high-redshift compact objects, similar to those recently discovered by JWST. Although we focuse on PBHs in this work, the bound on the initial mass of the seed black holes remains robust even if they were formed through astrophysical channels.</description>

      <title>Towards including super-sample covariance in the unbinned likelihood for cluster abundance cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of the abundance of galaxy clusters in the Universe is a sensitive probe of cosmology, which depends on both the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of structure. Density fluctuations across the finite survey volume add noise to this measurement, this is often referred to as super-sample covariance (SSC). For an unbinned cluster analysis, such noise has not been included in the cluster likelihood, since the effect of SSC was small compared to the Poisson shot-noise for samples of a few hundred clusters. For upcoming large cluster surveys such as the Rubin LSST, which will deliver catalogs of tens of thousands of clusters, this effect will no longer be negligible. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid likelihood based on the Gauss-Poisson Compound model (GPC), by using infinitesimal mass bins and standard redshift bins. This likelihood has the advantages of an unbinned Poisson likelihood whilst successfully incorporating the effects of SSC. Using a simulated dark matter halo catalog, we find that the hybrid likelihood, accounting for both Poisson noise and SSC, increases the dispersion of the parameter posteriors by 20 percent when using 100,000 clusters compared to the standard unbinned likelihood, based on Poisson statistics only.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XV: Population Analysis of Lines of Sight of 25 Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Extreme Value Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-Delay Cosmography is a technique for measuring $H_0$ with strong gravitational lensing. It requires a correction for line of sight perturbations, and it is necessary to build tools to assess populations of these lines of sight efficiently. We aim demonstrate the techniques necessary to analyze line of sight effects at a population level, and investigate whether strong lenses fall in preferably overdense environments. We analyze a set of 25 galaxy-galaxy lens lines of sight in the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey sample using standard techniques, then perform a hierarchical analysis to constrain the population-level parameters. We introduce a new statistical model for these posteriors that may provide insight into the underlying physics of the system. We find the median value of $\kappa_{\rm{ext}}$ in the population model to be $0.033 \pm 0.010$. The median value of $\kappa_{\rm{ext}}$ for the individual lens posteriors is $0.008 \pm 0.015$. Both approaches demostrate that our systems are drawn from an overdense sample. The different results from these two approaches show the importance of population models that do not multiply the effect of our priors.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianities in primordial black hole formation and induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating PBHs is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function and induced gravitational waves (GWs) with such non-Gaussianities. When the PBH abundance is fixed, non-Gaussianity only has mild impact on the spectral shape of the induced GWs, which gives relatively robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting signatures of thermal axions in nonstandard cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the formation of a thermal population of hadronic axions in nonstandard cosmologies, in light of the recent developments in obtaining continuous and smooth interaction rates for both the gluon and photon couplings. For certain cosmological histories, such as low-temperature reheating (LTR) and kination-like scenarios, the thermalization of the axion can be severely delayed to higher masses. In the case that thermal equilibrium is achieved, we improve the constraints on LTR for axion masses around the eV scale with respect to previous works and we constrain for the first time early matter-dominated (EMD) cosmologies. We also point out the possibility of having the co-existence of cold and warm dark matter populations of axions in kination-like scenarios in the eV mass range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 48 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly meant provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions.</description>

      <title>Note on black holes with kilometer-scale ultraviolet regulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular black hole metrics involve a universal, mass-independent regulator that can be up to O(700) km while remaining consistent with terrestrial tests of Newtonian gravity and astrophysical tests of general relativistic orbits. However, for such large values of the regulator scale, the metric describes a compact, astrophysical-mass object with no horizon rather than a black hole. We note that allowing the regulator to have a nontrivial mass dependence preserves the horizon, while allowing large, percent-level effects in black hole observables. By considering the deflection angle of light and the black hole shadow, we demonstrate this possibility explicitly.</description>

      <title>Fireball anti-nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tentative identification of approximately ten relativistic anti-helium cosmic-ray events at AMS-02 would, if confirmed, challenge our understanding of the astrophysical synthesis of heavy anti-nuclei. We propose a novel scenario for the enhanced production of such anti-nuclei that is triggered by isolated, catastrophic injections of large quantities of energetic Standard Model (SM) anti-quarks in our galaxy by physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We demonstrate that SM anti-nucleosynthetic processes that occur in the resulting rapidly expanding, thermalized fireballs of SM plasma can, for a reasonable range of parameters, produce the reported tentative $\sim 2:1$ ratio of anti-helium-3 to anti-helium-4 events at AMS-02, as well as their relativistic boosts. Moreover, we show that this can be achieved without violating anti-deuterium or anti-proton flux constraints for the appropriate anti-helium fluxes. A plausible BSM paradigm for the catastrophic injections is the collision of macroscopic composite dark-matter objects carrying large net anti-baryon number. Such a scenario would require these objects to be cosmologically stable, but to destabilize upon collision, promptly releasing a fraction of their mass energy into SM anti-particles within a tiny volume. We show that, in principle, the injection rate needed to attain the necessary anti-helium fluxes and the energetic conditions required to seed the fireballs appear possible to obtain in such a paradigm. We leave open the question of constructing a BSM particle physics model to realize this, but we suggest two concrete scenarios as promising targets for further investigation.</description>

      <title>A deep learning model for the density profiles of subhaloes in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based model for the total density profiles of subhaloes with masses $M \gtrsim 7\times 10^8\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ in the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. The model is based on an interpretable variational encoder (IVE) which returns the independent factors of variation in the density profiles within a low-dimensional representation, as well as the predictions for the density profiles themselves. The IVE returns accurate and unbiased predictions on all radial ranges, including the outer region profile where the subhaloes experience tidal stripping; here its fit accuracy exceeds that of the commonly used Einasto profile. The IVE discovers three independent degrees of freedom in the profiles, which can be interpreted in terms of the formation history of the subhaloes. In addition to the two parameters controlling the normalization and inner shape of the profile, the IVE discovers a third parameter that accounts for the impact of tidal stripping onto the subhalo outer profile; this parameter is sensitive to the mass loss experienced by the subhalo after its infall onto its parent halo. Baryonic physics in the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model does not impact the number of degrees of freedom identified in the profile compared to the pure dark matter expectations, nor their physical interpretation. Our newly proposed profile fit can be used in strong lensing analyses or other observational studies which aim to constrain cosmology from small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of an ionized bubble: NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the $z=6.6$ double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter COLA1 and its environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasingly neutral intergalactic gas at $z&gt;6$ impacts the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux observed from galaxies. One luminous galaxy, COLA1, stands out because of its unique double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ line at $z=6.6$, unseen in any simulation of reionization. Here we present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy in a 21 arcmin$^2$ field centered on COLA1. We find 141 galaxies spectroscopically-selected through the [OIII]($\lambda4969,5008$) doublet at $5.35&lt;z&lt;6.95$, with 40 of these sources showing H$\beta$. For COLA1 we additionally detect [OIII]$_{4363}$ and H$\gamma$. We measure a systemic redshift of $z=6.5917$ for COLA1, confirming the double-peak nature of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. This implies that it resides in a highly ionized bubble and that it is leaking ionizing photons with a high escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}{\rm (LyC)}=20$-$50$%, making it a prime laboratory to study Lyman continuum escape in the Epoch of Reionization. COLA1 shows all the signs of a prolific ionizer with a Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of $81\pm5\%$, Balmer decrement indicating no dust, a steep UV slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}=-3.2\pm 0.4$), and a star-formation surface density $\gtrsim 10\times$ that of typical galaxies at similar redshift. We detect 5 galaxies in COLA1's close environment ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$). Exploiting the high spectroscopic completeness inherent to grism surveys, and using mock simulations that mimic the selection function, we show the that number of detected companions is very typical for a similarly UV-bright ($M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-21.3$) galaxy; that is, the ionized bubble around COLA1 is unlikely due to an excessively large over-density. Instead, the measured ionizing properties suggest that COLA1 by itself might be powering the bubble required to explain its double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile ($R_{\rm ion}\approx0.7$ pMpc), with minor contribution from detected neighbours ($-17.5&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-19.5$).</description>
