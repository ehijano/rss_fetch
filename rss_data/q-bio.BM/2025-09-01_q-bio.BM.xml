      <title>Pep2Prob Benchmark: Predicting Fragment Ion Probability for MS$^2$-based Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information. Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless, this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring sophisticated machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Compass Mechanism in Cryptochromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptochrome flavoproteins are prime candidates for mediating magnetic sensing in migratory animals via the radical pair mechanism (RPM), a spin-dependent process initiated by photoinduced electron transfer. The canonical FAD-tryptophan radical pair exhibits pronounced anisotropic hyperfine couplings, enabling sensitivity to geomagnetic fields. However, maintaining spin coherence under physiological conditions and explaining responses to weak radiofrequency fields remain unresolved challenges. Alternative radicals, such as superoxide and ascorbate, have been proposed to enhance anisotropy or suppress decoherence. This review summarizes the quantum basis of magnetoreception, evaluates both canonical and alternative radical pair models, and discusses amplification strategies including triads, spin scavenging, and bystander radicals. Emphasis is placed on how molecular geometry, exchange and dipolar interactions, and hyperfine topology modulate magnetic sensitivity. Key open questions and future directions are outlined, highlighting the need for structural and dynamical data under physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>ImmunoAI: Accelerated Antibody Discovery Using Gradient-Boosted Machine Learning with Thermodynamic-Hydrodynamic Descriptors and 3D Geometric Interface Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require 10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on 117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2 variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Stable electron-irradiated [1-$^{13}$C]alanine radicals for clinically viable metabolic imaging with Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (dDNP) increases the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments by $&gt;10^4$-fold, permitting isotopically-labelled molecules to be transiently visible in MRI scans. dDNP requires a source of unpaired electrons in contact with labelled nuclei, cooled to $\sim$1K, and spin-pumped into a given state by microwaves. These electrons are usually chemical radicals, requiring removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources, such as UV irradiation, generate lower polarisation and require cryogenic transport. We present ultra-high-dose-rate electron irradiation as a novel alternative for generating non-persistent radicals in alanine/glycerol mixtures. These are stable for months at room temperature, quench spontaneously upon dissolution, are present in dose-dependent concentrations, and generate comparable nuclear polarisation to trityl radicals used clinically (20\%) through a novel mechanism. This process is inherently sterilising, permitting imaging of alanine metabolism \textit{in vivo}. As well as scientific novelty, this overcomes the biggest barrier to clinically translating dDNP.</description>
