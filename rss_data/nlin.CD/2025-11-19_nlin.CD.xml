      <title>Investigating the Phase Space Dynamics of Hamiltonian Systems by the Origin-Fate Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase space transport in a two-dimensional stretched caldera potential using the Origin-Fate Map (OFM) framework, complemented by Lagrangian Descriptor (LD) analysis. The caldera potential, a model for reaction dynamics with multiple exit channels, is adjusted by a stretching factor lambda that controls the directional bias of the four-saddle landscape. Several OFMs are constructed for two Poincare surfaces of section using forwards and backwards symplectic integration to assign each initial condition a channel of origin and fate. Our results reproduce the highly symmetric lambda = 1.0 patterns reported in Hillebrand et al. (Phys. Rev. E 108, 024211, 2023), and reveal, for smaller lambda, pronounced channel imbalance, figure-eight transport loops, and complex mixed-channel chaotic regions. Long-time integrations show a reduction of trapped regions with boundaries that exhibit self-similarity under deep zoom, revealing fractal-like structures. High-resolution OFMs and LD gradient maps uncover lobe dynamics and manifold structures that govern transport, showing near-perfect alignment between LD ridges and OFM boundaries.</description>

      <title>Universal regimes of strong turbulence in the multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.</description>

      <title>Convective Space-Time Chaos as a Dynamical Model of Deterministic and Stochastic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a concept of deterministic and stochastic turbulence has been introduced based on experiments with a boundary layer. In these experiments, the flow was driven with controlled random perturbation; in addition, natural ambient noise was also present. Deterministic property manifested itself as repeatability of turbulence patterns induced by identical random perturbations at the inlet (deterministic turbulence). A stochastic non-identical component originating from natural noise grows and eventually dominates the flow further downstream (stochastic turbulence). We argue that these properties can be explained by exploring the concept of convective space-time chaos, where secondary perturbations on top of a chaotic state grow but move away in the laboratory reference frame. We illustrate this with two simple models of convective space-time chaos, one is a partial differential equation describing waves on a film flowing down a plate, and the other is a set of unidirectionally coupled ordinary differential equations. To prove convective space-time chaos, we calculate the profiles of the convective Lyapunov exponent. The repeatability of the turbulent field in different identical experimental runs corresponds to the reliability of stable dynamical systems in response to random forcing. The onset of the stochastic component is quantified with the spatial Lyapunov exponent. We demonstrate how an effective randomization of the field is observed when the driving is quasiperiodic. Furthermore, we discuss space-time duality, which links sensitivity to boundary conditions in the convective space-time chaos to the usual sensitivity to initial conditions in a standard chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>Energy, enstrophy and helicity transfers in polymeric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the scale-by-scale transfers of energy, enstrophy and helicity in homogeneous and isotropic polymeric turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The microscale Reynolds number is set to $Re_\lambda \approx 460$, and the Deborah number $De = \tau_p/\tau_f$ is varied between $1/9 \le De \le 9$; $\tau_p$ is the polymeric relaxation time and $\tau_f$ is the turnover time of the largest scales of the flow. The study relies on the exact scale-by-scale budget equations (derived from the the governing model equations) for energy, enstrophy and helicity, which account for the back-reaction of the polymers on the flow. Polymers act as a sink/source in the flow, and provide alternative routes for the scale-by-scale transfers of the three quantities, whose relevance changes with $De$. We find that polymers deplete the nonlinear energy cascade mainly at smaller scales, by weakening both the extreme forward as well as reverse local events. The new polymer-driven energy flux dominates at small scales for $De \ge 1$, and on average transfers energy from larger to smaller scales with localised backscatter events. Polymers weaken the stretching of vorticity with the enstrophy being mainly generated by the fluid-polymer interaction, especially when $De \ge 1$. Accordingly, an inspection of the small-scale flow topology shows that polymers favour events with two-dimensional state of straining, and promote/inhibit extreme extension/rotation events: in polymeric turbulence shear and planar extensional flows are more probable. The helicity injected at the largest scales shows a similar transfer process to as energy, being mainly driven by the nonlinear cascade at large scales and by the polymer-driven flux at small scales. Polymers are found to favour events that break the small-scale mirror symmetry, with the relative helicity monotonically increasing with $De$ at all scales.</description>

      <title>Topological gravity for arbitrary Dyson index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the well established duality of topological gravity to a double scaled matrix model with the Airy spectral curve to define what we refer to as topological gravity with arbitrary Dyson index $\upbeta$ ($\upbeta$ topological gravity). On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index between the Wigner-Dyson universality classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as interpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the gravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space volumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we study correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural properties, having clear implications for the generalised moduli space volumes. Additionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like recursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate whether $\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the symplectic Wigner-Dyson class, not studied in the literature yet, and establish strong evidence for quantum chaos for this version of the theory, and thus for all bosonic varieties of topological gravity. We further argue for quantum chaoticity in the general $\upbeta$ case, based on novel constraints we find to be obeyed by genuinely non-Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space volumes. As for the general $\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected from a chaotic system is not known fully analytically we give a novel way to approach it, starting with the result of $\upbeta$ topological gravity and compare the results to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.</description>
