      <title>Simplified equations for the semi-localized transitions (SLT) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplified version of the semi-localized transitions (SLT) model is derived. The SLT-QE5 approximation reduces the number of differential equations from seven to five. Numerical calculations show that the approximation is very good for various trap parameters except the case with large reduction of activation energy during recombination to adjacent hole together with very low retrapping coefficient.</description>

      <title>A 5.9 GHz Sezawa SAW Acoustic Delay Line Based on Al0.6Sc0.4N-on-Sapphire with Propagation Q-factor &gt; 3,000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12480v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line based on a Scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN)-on-sapphire platform operating at 5.9 GHz with an exceptionally high acoustic propagation Q-factor. An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL). The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths, after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at 5.9 GHz, with a group velocity (v_g) of around 5,779 m/s. Based on these results, the proposed ADLs exhibit a high acoustic propagation Q-factor of 3,044. These findings highlight the potential of AlScN-on-sapphire platforms for high operational frequency, low-loss SAW ADL devices in advanced RF applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal Transport of GaN/Substrate Heterostructures under Non-Uniform Heat Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat generated in gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) is often concentrated in nanoscale regions and must dissipate through multiple heterostructures. However, the influence of non-uniform heat sources on the thermal transport of such heterostructures remains unclear. In this work, a thermal transport model for heterostructures under the non-uniform heat source is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations. Temperature, heat flux, and spectral thermal conductance distributions are compared between uniform and non-uniform heat sources. The effects of heterostructure height, heat source width, and heat source height on thermal transfer characteristics are analyzed for four typical heterostructures: GaN/AlN, GaN/Diamond, GaN/Si, and GaN/SiC. The results reveal that non-uniform heat sources have little effect on average interfacial thermal conductance but induce pronounced local non-uniformity when the heterostructure height is small. The interfacial thermal conductance near the heat source region is significantly higher than that in other areas. As the heat source non-uniformity increases, the total thermal resistance of the heterostructure rises markedly, reaching several times that under uniform heat sources. Finite-element calculations fail to capture the combined effects of non-uniform heating and microscale dimensions, leading to a severe underestimation of heterostructure total thermal resistance. This work reveals the thermal transport mechanisms of heterostructures under non-uniform heat sources and provides theoretical guidance for the thermal design of wide-bandgap semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Morphological and Chemical Changes in Cd-free Colloidal QD-LEDs During Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) have demonstrated remarkable brightness, saturated color, and high efficiencies across a broad spectral range. However, in contrast to organic LEDs (OLEDs), QD-LED operational lifetimes remain limited, with the underlying degradation mechanisms not fully understood. In the present study, we show that InP/ZnSe/ZnS (red-emitting) and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS (blue-emitting) cadmium-free colloidal QD-LEDs undergo nanoscale morphological changes during operation. Specifically,interparticle coarsening and layer thinning are observed in the electron transport layer (ETL) consisting of ZnMgO nanoparticles (NPs), in the QD emissive layer, and in the organic hole transport layer. This is accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals throughout the device, with oxygen accumulating at the electrode/ETL interfance. Moreover, in situ transmission electron microscopy reveals the electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO NPs coarsening. To mitigate these degradation pathway, we show that acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilize the ETL/QD layers by suppressing the radical formation and halting morphology changes. This approach achieves dramatic stability enhancements, exhibits an 8-fold and 5000-fold lifetime improvement on InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs, respectively. Our findings establish the causal relationships between the morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and state-of-the-art QD-LEDs instability, providing new insights into a scalable encapsulation treatment that enables efficient and long-lived Cd-free QD-LEDs.</description>

      <title>Terahretz Channel Modeling in ULEO Satellite-to-Ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth in satellite data traffic demands communication systems exceeding current microwave capacity limitations, while the terahertz (THz) frequency band (0.1-10 THz) offers unprecedented bandwidth potential with superior weather resilience compared to optical systems, particularly when combined with ultra-low Earth orbit (ULEO) satellite deployments below 300 km altitude. This article presents comprehensive channel modeling and performance evaluation for ULEO-THz satellite-to-ground communications, analyzing three distinct transmission architectures (direct satellite-to-ground, satellite-relay-ground forwarding, and satellite-to-high altitude base station with fiber backhaul) through altitude-resolved atmospheric propagation models validated using year-long meteorological data from four high-altitude stations in Tibet and Qinghai, China. The analysis incorporates frequency-dependent atmospheric absorption using ITU-R standards, free-space path loss with curved atmospheric modeling, and regional atmospheric variations to derive total channel path loss, available bandwidth capacity, and bit error rate (BER) performance under both AWGN and Weibull fading conditions across multiple THz frequencies. Results demonstrate that direct satellite-to-ground transmission at lower THz frequencies achieves optimal practical performance with maximum available bandwidth under QPSK modulation, while satellite-relay-ground forwarding suffers prohibitive cumulative losses from multiple hops, and satellite-to-high altitude base station configurations, despite favorable atmospheric channel characteristics, become impractical due to substantial electro-optical conversion penalties and fiber transmission losses in long-haul applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of the acoustic frequency-up conversion effect by nonlinear thin plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical methods of sound absorption present fundamental limits that can be overcome by using nonlinear effects. Thin clamped plates have been identified as strongly nonlinear elements, capable of transferring the acoustic power of an incident air-borne wave towards higher frequencies. Here, we experimentally show that these plates exhibit different vibrational nonlinear behaviors depending on the amplitude and frequency of the excitation signal. The lowest excitation levels achieved lead to harmonic generation in a weakly nonlinear regime, while higher levels produce quasi-periodic and chaotic regimes. Since these nonlinear vibration regimes govern the acoustic frequency-up conversion process, we investigate the influence of relevant physical and geometrical parameters on the emergence of these nonlinear regimes. A parametric study on plates of different thicknesses reveals that the frequency-up conversion effect is mostly guided by the resonance of the plate at its first eigenfrequency, which depends not only on its thickness but also on a static tension introduced by the clamping. Finally, a design proposition involving multiple plates with different properties is presented in order to reach a broadband frequency-up conversion.</description>

      <title>A general thermodynamic model for the steady-state temperature of a photovoltaic module on the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic conversion is highly dependent on the converter's temperature. In the absence of atmosphere, it can be rigorously determined using a thermal balance leading to a compact expression. The derivation starts from a fully spectral, two-sided radiative balance and proceeds to a practical gray-band (integrated) expression that can be used to estimate Tc from measurable quantities: plane-of-array irradiance, spectral absorptance (or a broadband absorptance), thermal emissivities, view factors to the regolith and to space, module electrical efficiency, and conduction to the mount. The model can be extended to other airless celestial bodies and to deep space.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Light Interstitial Segregation Energies in Ni: The Role of Local Cr Coordination for Boron and Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding interstitial segregation in chemically complex alloys requires accounting for chemical and structural heterogeneity of interfaces, motivating approaches that move beyond scalar descriptors to capture the full spatial and compositional spectra of segregation behavior. Here, we introduce a spectral segregation framework that maps distributions of segregation energies for light interstitials in Ni as a function of local Cr coordination. Boron exhibits a broad, rugged energy spectrum with significant positional flexibility whereas carbon remains confined to a narrow spectrum with minimal displacement. At the free surface, Cr-rich coordination destabilizes both interstitials (e.g., positive segregation energies), in sharp contrast to the stabilizing role of Cr at the GB. This inversion establishes a natural segregation gradient that drives interstitials away from undercoordinated internal surfaces and toward GBs. These results underscore the limitations of single-valued segregation descriptors and demonstrate how a distributional approach reveals the mechanistic origins of interstitial--interface interactions in chemically heterogeneous alloys.</description>

      <title>Topological Phononic Crystal on the Scale of Quasi-Ballistic Phonon Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon engineering technology has opened up the functional thermal management of semiconductor-based classical and quantum electronics at the micro- and nanoscales. However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal characteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic thermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon behaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be compatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological phononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and designable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study, we experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of quasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based topological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed through change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters of topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using topological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors were found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly, the topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in micro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results pave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena, such as quasi-ballistic phonons.</description>

      <title>Real-time vacuum-state quantum random number generator on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) produce true random numbers, which are guaranteed by the fundamental principles of quantum physics. Miniaturization of QRNGs is crucial for a wide range of communication and cryptography applications. Here, we first report a fully functional QRNG chip based on vacuum-state fluctuations, with dimensions of 16.6 mm x 7.8 mm. The quantum entropy source, which is achieved via hybrid photonic integration with a SiO2 waveguide, generates raw quantum random numbers. The hybrid photonic and electrical components are assembled into a compact ceramic package using system-in-package technology. A microcontroller unit acquires the raw data and outputs the processed quantum random numbers via a serial peripheral interface. According to the characterization results, the QRNG chip achieves a constant real-time output rate of 5.2 Mbps across the industrial temperature range of -40{\deg}C to 85{\deg}C, making it suitable for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>

      <title>Real-time, Adaptive Radiological Anomaly Detection and Isotope Identification Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Stress States of Theoretically Modelled Polarimetric Measurements on Dielectric Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes a theoretical model of a reflective polarimetric measurement technique determining the surface stress of a dielectric material, e.g. glass. We have developed a procedure to reconstruct the actual stress state, which is the orientation and value of the principal axes of stress, from the calculated Stokes vector components that would appear as polarization signals in a measurement. We consider a special geometry of the principle stress axis, where we chose one of them to be perpendicular to the surface and relaxed to a zero value. Our new approach of reconstructing surface stress states from reflected polarization states embraces the determination of the reflection M\"uller matrix. With that and an initial Stokes vector, the resulting reflected Stokes vector is calculated to create a database. The database represents the dependence of the resulting Stokes vector on the initial Stokes vector and the stress states included in the reflection matrix, which is iteratively calculated for several stress components and its orientations. Introducing a model for the dependency of the reflected Stokes vector components on the stress states and fitting it to the database results in a system of equations of those dependencies which are solved for the stress state components and orientation. Finally, we found a theoretical determination accuracy of the model for surface stress magnitude to be of the order of a few MPa.</description>

      <title>HiLAB: A Hybrid Inverse-Design Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs. Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters, produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude, accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green, and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust, multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation nanophotonic challenges.</description>
