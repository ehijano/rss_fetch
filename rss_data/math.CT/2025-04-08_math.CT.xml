      <title>Lax structures in 2-category theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on topics in 2-category theory: in particular on double categories, pseudomonads and codescent objects. In Chapter 2 we recall all the necessary notions. In Chapter 3 we show that factorization systems can be equivalently described as double categories satisfying certain properties. In Chapter 4 we focus on turning weak (colax) structures into strict ones in a universal way - this covers for instance colax monoidal categories or lax functors. In Chapter 5 we study the Kleisli 2-category for a lax-idempotent pseudomonad, the application of which is establishing weak cocompleteness of 2-categories such as the one of monoidal categories and lax monoidal functors. Finally, Chapter 6 focuses on the process of turning any 2-monad into a lax-idempotent one.</description>

      <title>A note on delay-inverse systems, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of an inverse system in a category was recently introduced, as well as that of the corresponding pro-category These so called the delay-inverse systems and delay-pro-category could potentially yield a new theory of (delay-) inverse systems as well as a kind of coarser abstract shape theory. However, we have proven that, whenever an indexing set has cardinality $\aleph_{n}, n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the potential new theory reduces, in its essence (the classification and invariants), to the ordinary one.</description>

      <title>Aggregating time-series and image data: functors and double functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregation of time-series or image data over subsets of the domain is a fundamental task in data science. We show that many known aggregation operations can be interpreted as (double) functors on appropriate (double) categories. Such functorial aggregations are amenable to parallel implementation via straightforward extensions of Blelloch's parallel scan algorithm. In addition to providing a unified viewpoint on existing operations, it allows us to propose new aggregation operations for time-series and image data.</description>

      <title>A 2-Categorical Bridge Between Henkin Constructions and Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem: Unifying Completeness and Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified categorical framework that connects the syntactic Henkin construction for the first-order Completeness Theorem with Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem. Concretely, we define two canonical functors from the category of first-order theories to the category of their models, and then introduce a canonical natural transformation that links the Henkin-based term models to semantically constructed models arising from compactness or saturation arguments. We prove that every component of this natural transformation is an isomorphism, thereby establishing a strong equivalence between the syntactic and semantic perspectives. Furthermore, we show that this transformation is 2-categorically rigid: any other natural transformation in the same setting is uniquely isomorphic to it. Our framework highlights the shared diagonalization principle underlying both Henkin's and Lawvere's methods and demonstrates concrete applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the design of advanced type-theoretic systems.</description>

      <title>Profinite Direct Sums with Applications to Profinite Groups of Type $\Phi_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the "profinite direct sum" is a good notion of infinite direct sums for profinite modules having properties similar to direct sums of abstract modules. For example, the profinite direct sum of projective modules is projective, and there is a Mackey's Formula for profinite modules described using these sums. As an application, we prove that the class of profinite groups of type $\Phi_R$ is closed under subgroups.</description>

      <title>Premonoidal and Kleisli double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a double categorical version of the recently introduced notion of premonoidal bicategories. We introduce a funny product and a funny type of multicategory on double categories granting them a closed funny monoidal structure. We investigate relations between various funny type of structures and premonoidal double categories. We prove that a premonoidal double category $\Dd$ is purely central if and only if its binoidal structure is given by a pseudodouble quasi-functor (a multimap for a Gray type of multicategory) if and only if it admits a monoidal structure. For such $\Dd$ we introduce pure center and show that the monoidal structure on $\Dd$ extends to it. We also discuss one-sided and general centers.
  Exploiting the companion-lifting properties of vertical structures in a double category into their horizontal counterparts, we prove a series of further results simplifying proofs for the corresponding bicategorical findings. We introduce vertical strengths on vertical double monads and horizontal strengths on horizontal double monads and prove that the former induce the latter. We show that vertical strengths induce actions of the induced horizontally monoidal double category on the corresponding Kleisli double category of the induced horizontal double monad. We prove that there is a 1-1 correspondence between horizontal strengths and extensions of the canonical action of the double category on itself. Finally, we show that for a bistrong vertical double monad the corresponding Kleisli double category is premonoidal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how change of enriching base category via a faithful, conservative right adjoint functor interacts with enriched coverages and sheaves on a given enriched category. We prove that change of base via such a functor gives rise both to an injective mapping on subobjects in enriched presheaf categories, and to an injective mapping on enriched coverages. In case the base change functor is also full, the enriched associated sheaf construction on a presheaf category commutes with base change.</description>

      <title>A characterisation for the category of Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The categories of real and of complex Hilbert spaces with bounded linear maps have received purely categorical characterisations by Chris Heunen and Andre Kornell. These characterisations are achieved through Sol\`er's theorem, a result which shows that certain orthomodularity conditions on a Hermitian space over an involutive division ring result in a Hilbert space with the division ring being either the reals, complexes or quaternions. The characterisation by Heunen and Kornell makes use of a monoidal structure, which in turn excludes the category of quaternionic Hilbert spaces. We provide an alternative characterisation without the assumption of monoidal structure on the category. This new approach not only gives a new characterisation of the categories of real and of complex Hilbert spaces, but also the category of quaternionic Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Operads and the Markov Property on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov processes on the lattices with arbitrary dimension are omnipresent in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1, for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: as an example, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. The present work fills this gap by providing a new and complete algebraic description of these models without any other assumption than the Markov property. In order to handle higher dimensions and higher products, the language of operads is used in order to focus on associativities and the geometric interpretation of the algebraic products. This formalism leads to a new parametrization of boundary conditions of Markov processes, with concrete computations. This parametrization is inspired matrix product states in the physics literature. Among others, a probabilistic application elaborated in this paper is the construction of translation-invariant infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice by using Kolmogorov's extension; this provides a new alternative tool to the traditional analytical approaches of large size limits. Various models are considered as illustrations.</description>

      <title>Twisted post-Hopf algebras, twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators and Hopf trusses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present article is devoted to study the categorical relationships between the categories of Hopf trusses, weak twisted post-Hopf algebras and weak twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter objects are a generalisation of relative Rota-Baxter operators where the Rota-Baxter condition is modified through a cocycle. Under certain conditions, this work shows that the three aforementioned categories are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Higher Auslander-Gorenstein Algebras And Gabriel Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study the relationship between two important notions in ring theory, category theory, and representation theory of Artin algebras; namely, Gabriel topologies and higher Auslander(-Gorenstein) algebras. It is well-known that the class of all torsionless modules over a higher Auslander(-Gorenstein) algebra is a torsion-free class of a hereditary torsion theory that is cogenerated by its injective envelope and so by Gabriel-Maranda correspondence we can define a Gabriel topology on it. We show that higher Auslander(-Gorenstein) algebras can be characterized by this Gabriel topology. This characterization can be considered as a higher version of the Auslander-Buchsbaum-Serre theorem that is considered as one of the most important achievements of the use of homological algebra in the theory of commutative rings. Among some applications, the results also reveal a relation between the projective dimension of a module and the projective dimensions of the annihilator ideals of its objects over higher Auslander algebras.</description>

      <title>Injective generation for graded rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate injective generation for graded rings. We first examine the relation between injective generation and graded injective generation for graded rings. We then reduce the study of injective generation for graded rings to the study of injective generation for certain Morita context rings and we provide sufficient conditions for injective generation of the latter. We then provide necessary and sufficient conditions so that injectives generate for tensor rings and for trivial extension rings. We provide two proofs for the class of tensor rings, the one uses covering theory and the other uses the framework of cleft extensions of module categories. We finally prove injective generation for twisted tensor products of finite dimensional algebras.</description>
