      <title>An Improved Physically-Based Surface Triangulation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes improvements to the physically-based surface triangulation method, bubble meshing. The method simulates physical bubbles to automatically generate mesh vertices, resulting in high-quality Delaunay triangles. Despite its flexibility in local mesh size control and the advantage of local re-meshing, bubble meshing is constrained by high computational costs and slow convergence on complex surfaces. The proposed approach employs conformal mapping to simplify surface bubble packing by flattening the surface onto a plane. Surface triangulation is induced from the planar mesh, avoiding direct bubble movement on the surface. Optimizing bubble quantity control and separating it from the relaxation process accelerates convergence, cutting computation time by over 70%. The enhanced method enables efficient triangulation of disk topology surfaces, supports local size control, curvature adaptation, and re-meshing of discrete surfaces. Keywords: Adaptive triangulation, Surface remeshing, Bubble meshing, Conformal parameterization, Algorithm efficiency</description>

      <title>GASP: A Gradient-Aware Shortest Path Algorithm for Boundary-Confined Visualization of 2-Manifold Reeb Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization. Namely, they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to generate Reeb graph visualizations, called \textit{GASP}, that is cognizant of these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing Reeb graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Volume-Sensitive Bounds for Polytope Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating convex bodies is a fundamental question in geometry, which has a wide variety of applications. Given a convex body $K$ in $\textbf{R}^d$ for fixed $d$, the objective is to minimize the number of facets of an approximating polytope for a given Hausdorff error $\varepsilon$. It is known that $O((\text{diam}(K)/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ facets suffice and are necessary for many instances, such as the Euclidean ball. However, this bound is far from optimal for ``skinny'' convex bodies.
  A natural way to characterize the skinniness of a convex object is in terms of its relationship to the Euclidean ball. Given a convex body $K$, its \emph{volume diameter} $\Delta_d(K)$ is defined to be the diameter of a Euclidean ball of the same volume as $K$. The \emph{surface diameter} $\Delta_{d-1}(K)$ is defined analogously for surface area. It follows from generalizations of the isoperimetric inequality that $\text{diam}(K) \geq \Delta_{d-1}(K) \geq \Delta_d(K)$.
  Arya, da Fonseca, and Mount proved that the diameter-based bound could be made sensitive to the surface diameter, improving the above bound to $O((\Delta_{d-1}(K)/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$. In this paper, we strengthen this by proving the existence of an approximation with $O((\Delta_d(K)/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ facets. As a function of volume alone, this bound is tight up to constant factors.
  Our improvements arise from a combination of new ideas. We exploit known properties of the original body and its polar dual. In order to obtain a volume-sensitive bound, we explore the problem of computing a low-complexity polytope that is sandwiched between two given convex bodies. We show that this problem can be reduced to a covering problem involving a natural intermediate body based on the harmonic mean. Our proof relies on a geometric analysis of a relative notion of fatness involving these bodies.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Mesh to Improve the Triangular Expansion Algorithm for Computing Visibility Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of improving the query performance of the triangular expansion algorithm (TEA) for computing visibility regions by finding the most advantageous instance of the triangular mesh, the preprocessing structure. The TEA recursively traverses the mesh while keeping track of the visible region, the set of all points visible from a query point in a polygonal world. We show that the measured query time is approximately proportional to the number of triangle edge expansions during the mesh traversal. We propose a new type of triangular mesh that minimizes the expected number of expansions assuming the query points are drawn from a known probability distribution. We design a heuristic method to approximate the mesh and evaluate the approach on many challenging instances that resemble real-world environments. The proposed mesh improves the mean query times by 12-16% compared to the reference constrained Delaunay triangulation. The approach is suitable to boost offline applications that require computing millions of queries without addressing the preprocessing time. The implementation is publicly available to replicate our experiments and serve the community.</description>

      <title>Counts and end-curves in two-parameter persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite dimensional, bigraded module over the polynomial ring in two variables, we define its two-parameter count, a natural number, and its end-curves, a set of plane curves. These are two-dimensional analogues of the notions of bar-count and endpoints of singly-graded modules over the polynomial ring in one variable, from persistence theory. We show that our count is the unique one satisfying certain natural conditions; as a consequence, several inclusion-exclusion formulas in two-parameter persistence yield the same positive number, which equals our count, and which in turn equals the number of end-curves, giving geometric meaning to this count. We show that the end-curves determine the classical Betti tables by showing that they interpolate between generators, relations, and syzygies. Using the band representations of a certain string algebra, we show that the set of end-curves admits a canonical partition, where each part forms a closed curve on the plane; we call this the boundary of the module. As an invariant, the boundary is neither weaker nor stronger than the rank invariant, but, in contrast to the rank invariant, it is a complete invariant on the set of spread-decomposable representations. Our results connect several lines of work in multiparameter persistence, and their extension to modules over the real-exponent polynomial ring in two variables relates to two-dimensional Morse theory.</description>
