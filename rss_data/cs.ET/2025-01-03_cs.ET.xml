      <title>TReCiM: Lower Power and Temperature-Resilient Multibit 2FeFET-1T Compute-in-Memory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CiM) emerges as a promising solution to solve hardware challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly addressing the "memory wall" issue. By utilizing nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices in a crossbar structure, CiM efficiently accelerates multiply-accumulate (MAC) computations, the crucial operations in neural networks and other AI models. Among various NVM devices, Ferroelectric FET (FeFET) is particularly appealing for ultra-low-power CiM arrays due to its CMOS compatibility, voltage-driven write/read mechanisms and high ION/IOFF ratio. Moreover, subthreshold-operated FeFETs, which operate at scaling voltages in the subthreshold region, can further minimize the power consumption of CiM array. However, subthreshold-FeFETs are susceptible to temperature drift, resulting in computation accuracy degradation. Existing solutions exhibit weak temperature resilience at larger array size and only support 1-bit. In this paper, we propose TReCiM, an ultra-low-power temperature-resilient multibit 2FeFET-1T CiM design that reliably performs MAC operations in the subthreshold-FeFET region with temperature ranging from 0 to 85 degrees Celcius at scale. We benchmark our design using NeuroSim framework in the context of VGG-8 neural network architecture running the CIFAR-10 dataset. Benchmarking results suggest that when considering temperature drift impact, our proposed TReCiM array achieves 91.31% accuracy, with 1.86% accuracy improvement compared to existing 1-bit 2T-1FeFET CiM array. Furthermore, our proposed design achieves 48.03 TOPS/W energy efficiency at system level, comparable to existing designs with smaller technology feature sizes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Partition Function Estimation of a Markov Random Field in a Radar Anomaly Detection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In probability theory, the partition function is a factor used to reduce any probability function to a density function with total probability of one. Among other statistical models used to represent joint distribution, Markov random fields (MRF) can be used to efficiently represent statistical dependencies between variables. As the number of terms in the partition function scales exponentially with the number of variables, the potential of each configuration cannot be computed exactly in a reasonable time for large instances. In this paper, we aim to take advantage of the exponential scalability of quantum computing to speed up the estimation of the partition function of a MRF representing the dependencies between operating variables of an airborne radar. For that purpose, we implement a quantum algorithm for partition function estimation in the one clean qubit model. After proposing suitable formulations, we discuss the performances and scalability of our approach in comparison to the theoretical performances of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Seq2Seq Model-Based Chatbot with LSTM and Attention Mechanism for Enhanced User Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chatbot is an intelligent software application that automates conversations and engages users in natural language through messaging platforms. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots serve various functions, including customer service, information gathering, and casual conversation. Existing virtual assistant chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, demonstrate the potential of AI in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, many current solutions rely on predefined APIs, which can result in vendor lock-in and high costs. To address these challenges, this work proposes a chatbot developed using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an encoder-decoder architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. By avoiding predefined APIs, this approach ensures flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The chatbot is trained, validated, and tested on a dataset specifically curated for the tourism sector in Draa-Tafilalet, Morocco. Key evaluation findings indicate that the proposed Seq2Seq model-based chatbot achieved high accuracies: approximately 99.58% in training, 98.03% in validation, and 94.12% in testing. These results demonstrate the chatbot's effectiveness in providing relevant and coherent responses within the tourism domain, highlighting the potential of specialized AI applications to enhance user experience and satisfaction in niche markets.</description>

      <title>Distributed Traffic Control in Complex Dynamic Roadblocks: A Multi-Agent Deep RL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) represent a transformative advancement in the transportation industry. These vehicles have sophisticated sensors, advanced algorithms, and powerful computing systems that allow them to navigate and operate without direct human intervention. However, AVs' systems still get overwhelmed when they encounter a complex dynamic change in the environment resulting from an accident or a roadblock for maintenance. The advanced features of Sixth Generation (6G) technology are set to offer strong support to AVs, enabling real-time data exchange and management of complex driving maneuvers. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to improve AVs' decision-making in dynamic and complex Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) utilizing 6G-V2X communication. The primary objective is to enable AVs to avoid roadblocks efficiently by changing lanes while maintaining optimal traffic flow and maximizing the mean harmonic speed. To ensure realistic operations, key constraints such as minimum vehicle speed, roadblock count, and lane change frequency are integrated. We train and test the proposed MARL model with two traffic simulation scenarios using the SUMO and TraCI interface. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed model adapts to various traffic conditions and achieves efficient and robust traffic flow management. The trained model effectively navigates dynamic roadblocks, promoting improved traffic efficiency in AV operations with more than 70% efficiency over other benchmark solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimization of global quantum communication through satellite constellations. We address the challenge of quantum key distribution (QKD) across vast distances and the limitations posed by terrestrial fiber-optic networks. Our research focuses on the configuration of satellite constellations to improve QKD between ground stations and the application of innovative orbital mechanics to reduce latency in quantum information transfer. We introduce a novel approach using quantum relay satellites in Molniya orbits, enhancing communication efficiency and coverage. The use of these high eccentricity orbits allows us to extend the operational presence of satellites over targeted hemispheres, thus maximizing the quantum network's reach. Our findings provide a strategic framework for deploying quantum satellites and relay systems to achieve a robust and efficient global quantum communication network.</description>

      <title>LENS-XAI: Redefining Lightweight and Explainable Network Security through Knowledge Distillation and Variational Autoencoders for Scalable Intrusion Detection in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems necessitates advanced, interpretable, and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) to combat emerging cyber threats. Traditional IDS face challenges such as high computational demands, limited explainability, and inflexibility against evolving attack patterns. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Lightweight Explainable Network Security framework (LENS-XAI), which combines robust intrusion detection with enhanced interpretability and scalability. LENS-XAI integrates knowledge distillation, variational autoencoder models, and attribution-based explainability techniques to achieve high detection accuracy and transparency in decision-making. By leveraging a training set comprising 10% of the available data, the framework optimizes computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoTset, UKM-IDS20, CTU-13, and NSL-KDD, demonstrates the framework's superior performance, achieving detection accuracies of 95.34%, 99.92%, 98.42%, and 99.34%, respectively. Additionally, the framework excels in reducing false positives and adapting to complex attack scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Key strengths of LENS-XAI include its lightweight design, suitable for resource-constrained environments, and its scalability across diverse IIoT and cybersecurity contexts. Moreover, the explainability module enhances trust and transparency, critical for practical deployment in dynamic and sensitive applications. This research contributes significantly to advancing IDS by addressing computational efficiency, feature interpretability, and real-world applicability. Future work could focus on extending the framework to ensemble AI systems for distributed environments, further enhancing its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Host-guided data placement: whose job is it anyway?</title>

Abstract: The increasing demand for SSDs coupled with scaling difficulties have left manufacturers scrambling for newer SSD interfaces which promise better performance and durability. While these interfaces reduce the rigidity of traditional abstractions, they require application or system-level changes that can impact the stability, security, and portability of systems. To make matters worse, such changes are rendered futile with introduction of next-generation interfaces. Further, there is little guidance on data placement and hardware specifics are often abstracted from the application layer. It is no surprise therefore that such interfaces have seen limited adoption, leaving behind a graveyard of experimental interfaces ranging from open-channel SSDs to zoned namespaces.
  In this paper, we show how shim layers can to shield systems from changing hardware interfaces while benefiting from them. We present Reshim, an all-userspace shim layer that performs affinity and lifetime based data placement with no change to the operating system or the application. We demonstrate Reshim's ease of adoption with host-device coordination for three widely-used data-intensive systems: RocksDB, MongoDB, and CacheLib. With Reshim, these systems see 2-6 times highe write throughput, up to 6 times lower latency, and reduced write amplification compared to filesystems like F2FS. Reshim performs on par with application-specific backends like ZenFS while offering more generality, lower latency, and richer data placement. With Reshim we demonstrate the value of isolating the complexity of the placement logic, allowing easy deployment of dynamic placement rules across several applications and storage interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Genetic Algorithm Framework for the MaxCut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MaxCut problem is a fundamental problem in Combinatorial Optimization, with significant implications across diverse domains such as logistics, network design, and statistical physics. The algorithm represents innovative approaches that balance theoretical rigor with practical scalability. The proposed method introduces a Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) using a Grover-based evolutionary framework and divide-and-conquer principles. By partitioning graphs into manageable subgraphs, optimizing each independently, and applying graph contraction to merge the solutions, the method exploits the inherent binary symmetry of MaxCut to ensure computational efficiency and robust approximation performance. Theoretical analysis establishes a foundation for the efficiency of the algorithm, while empirical evaluations provide quantitative evidence of its effectiveness. On complete graphs, the proposed method consistently achieves the true optimal MaxCut values, outperforming the Semidefinite Programming (SDP) approach, which provides up to 99.7\% of the optimal solution for larger graphs. On Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, the QGA demonstrates competitive performance, achieving median solutions within 92-96\% of the SDP results. These results showcase the potential of the QGA framework to deliver competitive solutions, even under heuristic constraints, while demonstrating its promise for scalability as quantum hardware evolves.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simplicity and Sophistication using GLinear: A Novel Architecture for Enhanced Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields. There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, GLinear, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It also provides better prediction accuracy by using a smaller amount of historical data compared to other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictor (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being parametrically efficient, significantly outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF. We hope that the proposed GLinear opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

      <title>Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 16%, and a 20% HDVs nearly halves it. The study also develops an adaptive potential (APL) controller that forms APL corridors with modified PLs in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of 23.6% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs in LFT is required before significant benefits of LFT start appearing compared to a scenario with all HDVs. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.</description>

      <title>SARA: A Microservice-Based Architecture for Cross-Platform Collaborative Augmented Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) functionalities may be effectively leveraged in collaborative service scenarios (e.g., remote maintenance, on-site building, street gaming, etc.). Standard development cycles for collaborative AR require to code for each specific visualization platform and implement the necessary control mechanisms over the shared assets. This paper describes SARA, an architecture to support cross-platform collaborative Augmented Reality applications based on microservices. The architecture is designed to work over the concept of collaboration models (turn, layer, ownership,hierarchy-based and unconstrained examples) which regulate the interaction and permissions of each user over the AR assets. Thanks to the reusability of its components, during the development of an application, SARA enables focusing on the application logic while avoiding the implementation of the communication protocol, data model handling and orchestration between the different, possibly heterogeneous,devices involved in the collaboration (i.e., mobile or wearable AR devices using different operating systems). To describe how to build an application based on SARA, a prototype for HoloLens and iOS devices has been implemented. the prototype is a collaborative voxel-based game in which several players work real time together on a piece of land, adding or eliminating cubes in a collaborative manner to create buildings and landscapes. Turn-based and unconstrained collaboration models are applied to regulate the interaction, the development workflow for this case study shows how the architecture serves as a framework to support the deployment of collaborative AR services, enabling the reuse of collaboration model components, agnostically handling client technologies.</description>

      <title>Cool, But What About Oracles? An Oracle-Based Perspective on Blockchain Integration in the Accounting Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bitcoin Network is a sophisticated accounting system that allows its underlying cryptocurrency to be trusted even in the absence of a reliable financial authority. Given its undeniable success, the technology, generally referred to as blockchain, has also been proposed as a means to improve legacy accounting systems. Accounting for real-world data, however, requires the intervention of a third party known as an Oracle, which, having not the same characteristics as a blockchain, could potentially reduce the expected integration benefit. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study aims to investigate whether the papers concerning blockchain integration in accounting consider and address the limitations posed by oracles. A broad overview of the limitations that emerged in the literature is provided and distinguished according to the specific accounting integration. Results support the view that although research on the subject counts numerous articles, actual studies considering oracle limitations are lacking. Interestingly, despite the scarce production of papers addressing oracles in various accounting sectors, reporting for ESG already shows interesting workarounds for oracle limitations, with permissioned chains envisioned as a valid support for the safe storage of sustainability data.</description>
