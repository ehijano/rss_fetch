      <title>Type-II Weyl nodes, flat bands, and evidence for a topological Hall-effect in the new ferromagnet FeCr$_3$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between linearly dispersing or Dirac-like, and flat electronic bands, for instance, in the kagome ferromagnets, has attracted attention due to a possible interplay between topology and electronic correlations. Here, we report the synthesis, structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of a single-crystalline ferromagnetic compound, namely Fe$_{1/3}$CrTe$_2$ or FeCr$_3$Te$_6$, which crystallizes in the $P\bar{3}m1$ space group instead of the $I2/m$ previously reported for FeCr$_2$Te$_4$. Electronic band structure calculations reveal type-II Dirac nodes and relatively flat bands near the Fermi level ($\varepsilon_F$). This compound shows onset Curie temperature $T_{\text{c}}\simeq 120$ K, followed by an additional ferromagnetic transition near $T_{\text{c2}} \sim 92.5 $ K. Below $T_{\text{c}}$, FeCr$_3$Te$_6$ displays a pronounced anomalous Hall effect, as well as sizable coercive fields that exceed $\mu_0H = 1$~T at low $T$s. However, a scaling analysis indicates that the anomalous Hall effect results from a significant intrinsic contribution, as expected from the calculations, but also from the extrinsic mechanism, i.e., scattering. The extrinsic contribution probably results from occupational disorder at the 1b Fe-site within the van der Waals gap of the CrTe$_2$ host. We also observe evidence for a topological Hall component superimposed onto the overall Hall response, suggesting the presence of chiral spin textures akin to skyrmions in this centrosymmetric system. Their possible presence will require experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of strong coupling Bose polarons: From repulsive polarons to non-Gaussian many-body bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the Bose polaron problem of a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing) impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states, including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state. This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques. This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Field-tunable spin disordered phase in the triangular-lattice delafossite TlYbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice compound TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around ~ 30 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.</description>
