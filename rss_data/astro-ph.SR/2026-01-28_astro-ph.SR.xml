      <title>Homogenous abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti for about 1500 red giants in 16 globular clusters from FLAMES spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FLAMES survey ``Na-O anti-correlation and HB" uncovered the modern standard for globular clusters (GCs), that is their ubiquitous multiple stellar populations (MPs) distinct by the abundance of proton-capture elements. That survey can still be mined to extract a wealth of data. We derive new abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti for 948, 954, 1542, and 1350 red giant branch stars in 16 GCs, both formed in situ or accreted in the Milky Way. The program GCs cover the metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-2.35 dex to [Fe/H]=-0.74 dex. Both the halo and disc GCs show a clear overabundance of alpha-elements with the modulation in Mg and Si due to the MPs phenomenon in different clusters. We found star to star variations in Si abundance correlated to changes in Na in more than half of our sample, implying that temperatures in excess of about 65 MK were achieved in the polluters responsible for the enrichment. We confirm with an enlarged sample the previous result that significant variations in Mg are observed in GCs that are metal-poor, massive or both. Evidence of excess of Ca with respect to reference unpolluted field stars are found in NGC 6752 and NGC 7078, indicating the action of proton-capture reactions at very high temperature regime in these GCs. These excesses fit very well in a previously found relation as a function of a combination of cluster mass and metallicity shown by other typical signatures of MPs. At odds with previous results based on the Si abundance from APOGEE, we found that the average abundance of alpha-elements is not an efficient discriminating factor between in situ and accreted GCs.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous abundance ratios of hydrostatic and explosive alpha-elements in globular clusters from high resolution optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic globular clusters (GCs) were born shortly after the Big Bang. For such old stellar systems the initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass regime can never be observed directly, because stars more massive than about 1 Mo have evolved since longtime. However, the hydrostatic to explosive alpha-element ratio (HEx ratio) offers a way to bypass the lack of observable high mass stars through the yields that massive stars released when exploding as supernovae, incorporated in the stars we presently observe in GCs. The HEx ratio measures the percentage of high mass stars over the total number of stars exploding as supernovae and it is an efficient probe of the ephemeral first phases of the GC evolution. We exploited a recently completed survey to assemble a dataset of very homogeneous abundances of alpha-elements in 27 GCs from [Fe/H]~ -2.4 to ~ -0.3 dex. In agreement with previous results from APOGEE, we confirm that the HEx ratio is indistinguishable for GCs formed in situ and accreted in the Galaxy, and that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity. However, we posit that this trend is better explained by a metallicity-dependent IMF deficient in the highest mass stars at high metallicity, as corroborated by the declining [O/Mg] ratio as a function of the [Mg/H] ratio. At odds with the previous analysis based on APOGEE data, we detect an anti-correlation of HEx ratio with both present day and initial GC masses. Finally, we hypothesise that in that analysis, the stars of the GC M 54 were probably confused with stars in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, where the cluster is presently immersed.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood LIV: 54 Orbits of M Dwarf Multiples within 30 Parsecs with Speckle Interferometry at SOAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 1066 speckle measurements of M dwarf multiples observed over 2021-2024, all taken with HRCam on the Southern Astrophysical Research 4.1 m telescope. Among these, 900 observations resolve companions in 212 pairs, with separations spanning 17 milliarcseconds to 3.4 arcsec and brightness differences ranging from 0 to 4.9 magnitudes in the I filter. We have characterized the orbits of 54 of these companions, spanning periods of 0.67-30 yr, by combining our data with literature astrometry, radial velocities, and, in four cases, Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations. Among the orbits presented here are 28 that are the first-ever such characterizations for their systems, and 26 that revise previously-published orbits, thus providing a significant update to the observed dynamics of M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. From these orbits, we provide new and updated dynamical total masses for these systems, precise to 0.7-7% in nearly all cases. Future mass derivations for components in these systems will contribute to efforts in refining the mass-luminosity relation for the smallest stars, and will enhance investigations of age, magnetism, and metallicity effects on luminosities at a given mass.</description>

      <title>The MIRI Excess around Degenerates (MEAD) Survey II: A Probable Planet detected via IR Excess around WD 0644+025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIRI Excess Around Degenerates (MEAD) Survey is a cycle 2 JWST program designed to image nearby white dwarfs with MIRI at 10 and 15 microns. This survey targeted 56 white dwarfs within 25 pc to search for mid-infrared excesses, flux deficits from collision-induced absorption, and resolved substellar companions. In this paper we present our analysis of WD 0644+025, an unusually massive white dwarf (0.95 Msun) and the MEAD target exhibiting the most significant mid-infrared excess. The observed JWST MIRI photometry shows a 7.3 sigma excess at 15 microns and a 3.6 sigma excess at 10 microns, which may be associated with either a planetary companion or a circumstellar dust disk. This excess corresponds to a companion mass of 6.8 Mjup (Teff=261 +/- 9 K) with orbital distance &lt;11.8 au, although substantially lower masses are possible if we consider a closely orbiting insolated companion. No spatially resolved sources are detected within 200 au, with contrast curve analysis excluding planets more massive than 2 Mjup beyond ~12 au. Metal pollution is confirmed in both archival Keck HIRES spectra from 1999 and new observations from 2025, with no evidence suggesting the accretion rate has substantially changed over the decades. We explore possible dust disk morphologies to describe the observed IR excess, and find that traditional debris disks struggle to fit our data. WD 0644+025 thus represents a compelling case study in the growing population of white dwarfs with cold infrared excesses, and highlights JWST's ability to probe planetary system remnants inaccessible to prior infrared observatories.</description>

      <title>How to interpret near-infrared polarisation spectra of active M dwarfs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of global magnetic fields in M dwarfs rely on many approximations regarding the derivation of average line profiles from spectropolarimetric data, interpreting them with analytical functions and modelling them using Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI). These assumptions have not been systematically tested. We assessed the accuracy of standard treatments of average polarisation profiles in M dwarfs and their interpretation with ZDI. We focused on the filling-factor approach, which attempts to represent coexisting global and small-scale fields. We performed polarised radiative transfer calculations across the near-infrared spectrum of a typical M dwarf. From these theoretical spectra, we derived mean Stokes profiles and approximated them with different line-synthesis methods. To test the recovery of global fields, we performed ZDI inversions using simulated Stokes V observations for low- and high-activity cases. The analytical approximation of mean polarisation profiles reproduces Stokes I and V only for fields up to ~1 kG and fails for linear polarisation. ZDI with single-line analytical Stokes V profiles is adequate for weakly magnetic M dwarfs with fields below a few hundred gauss. However, combined with the filling-factor formalism, this traditional modelling approach produces unphysical local fields and distorted global geometries for active M dwarfs with multi-kilogauss fields. These issues are mitigated using a new mapping technique based on theoretical Stokes profiles that account for both global and randomly distributed small-scale fields. Our study reveals fundamental limitations of current ZDI analyses of active M dwarfs and questions the reliability of some published maps. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Appraising the Necklace: A post-common-envelope carbon dwarf inside an apparently carbon-poor planetary nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The Necklace nebula is a bipolar, post-common-envelope planetary nebula, the central star of which has been shown to have a dwarf carbon star companion. Aims: We aim to understand the origins of the Necklace and its dwarf carbon central star. Methods: We study the carbon abundance of the nebula through far ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Furthermore, through simultaneous modelling of multiband light and velocity curves, we attempt to constrain the parameters of the central star system. Results: Puzzlingly, we find that the region of the inner nebula observed with the Hubble Space Telescope is seemingly not carbon-rich, at odds with the dwarf carbon star nature of the companion of the central star. The initial mass of the nebular progenitor was likely very close to the limit to become carbon-rich, perhaps experiencing a very late thermal pulse. The dwarf carbon star companion is found to be significantly inflated with respect to that expected for an isolated main sequence star of the same mass. Conclusions: The properties of the central binary are consistent with the progenitor having become carbon-rich and its companion having accreted a significant amount of that carbon-enriched material. However, it is unclear how this evolutionary hypothesis can be reconciled with the inner nebula potentially being carbon poor.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Large-Scale Magnetic Field Disturbances and Switchbacks in Interplanetary Type III Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type III solar radio bursts are driven by non-thermal electron beams travelling along heliospheric magnetic fields, with the radio emission frequency drift-rate determined by the beam speed and the plasma density profile. Analysing beam kinematics inferred from the drift-rate reveals behaviour inconsistent with the emitter moving radially through smooth, monotonically decreasing density. We examine whether these features are driven by disturbances in the guiding magnetic field direction, such as switchbacks, rather than plasma inhomogeneities along the beam path. Using simulations and remote observations of 24 interplanetary type III bursts observed by Parker Solar Probe, we relate measured drift-rate variations to local field deflections. In 50% of events, we identify disturbances above a $2\sigma$ noise level that can be attributed to perpendicular deflections of the field between (0.7-1.7) R$_\odot$, over scales (1.8-6.4) R$_\odot$ at heliocentric distances (9-30) R$_\odot$. The features correspond to either density changes of (10-30)%, or deflections of the field direction by (23-88)$^\circ$. Further, beam transport simulations show field direction perturbations produce additional observational signatures in type III bursts: delayed emission, intensity breaks, and enhanced emission resembling stria fine structures. In addition, we identified four bursts where the observed variations are more plausibly explained by field deflections, possibly in the form of magnetic switchbacks, than by unrealistically large density changes along the field line. The results show that variations in type III burst profiles can arise from magnetic as well as density fluctuations, and demonstrate the value of type III bursts as remote probes of inner-heliospheric structure at kilometric wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Chemically peculiar stars investigated by the BRITE Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of BRITE photometry for 85 chemically peculiar stars, aimed at refining or determining their rotational periods. Utilizing a uniform Lomb-Scargle-based pipeline, we derived significant periods for 47 targets. A comparison with existing literature periods reveals generally good agreement, although several stars exhibit discrepant or previously unrecognized behavior. Notably, six targets display clear multiperiodicity, which, when combined with archival TESS data, suggests that these six candidates are likely misclassified, for example, as a magnetic CP2 or a CP4 star and instead exhibit characteristics consistent with a Be/shell star. Furthermore, eleven stars show no detectable periodic variations within the precision limits of BRITE. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of long-term nanosatellite photometry, particularly when complemented by TESS data, in verifying catalogue periods, identifying multiperiodic behavior, and detecting potential misclassifications among bright CP stars.</description>

      <title>Uniform Forward-Modeling Analysis of Ultracool Dwarfs. IV. Benchmarking the Sonora Diamondback and Saumon &amp; Marley (2008) Atmospheric Models Across Late-M, L, and T types with Low-Resolution 0.8-2.5 $\mu$m Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) We present a systematic assessment of two major cloudy atmospheric model grids -- SM08 (Saumon &amp; Marley 2008) and Sonora Diamondback -- when applied to low-resolution near-infrared (0.8-2.5 $\mu$m) spectroscopy. Our analysis focuses on a uniform sample of 142 age-benchmark brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects spanning late-M, L, and T spectral types, with independently determined ages from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr. We perform forward-model spectral fitting for all benchmarks' IRTF/SpeX spectra ($R\sim$80-250) using both SM08 and Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models to infer effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, and cloud sedimentation efficiencies. The two model grids yield broadly consistent results. Among L4-L9 dwarfs, we identify a statistically significant, population-level age dependence of the cloud parameter $f_{\rm sed}$, with young benchmarks ($&lt;300$ Myr) exhibiting systematically lower $f_{\rm sed}$ values than older counterparts. This trend is absent across L0-T5 and T0-T5, demonstrating that cloud properties vary with age and surface gravity and offering explanations for the observed gravity-dependent photometric properties at the late-L end of the L/T transition. By comparing spectroscopically inferred parameters with predictions from evolution models, we quantify systematic errors in the fitted atmospheric parameters and establish empirical calibrations to anchor future studies using these atmospheric models. Stacked residuals of the sample reveal wavelength-dependent data-model mismatches associated with key atomic and molecular absorption bands, highlighting the need for improved opacities and rainout chemistry. Finally, we show that including an interstellar-medium-like extinction term significantly improves the spectral fits, confirming and broadening previous findings and suggesting missing opacity sources in current cloudy models.</description>

      <title>Physical and Chemical Characterization of GY 91's Multi-ringed Protostellar Disk with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GY 91, commonly categorized as a Class I young stellar object, is notable for disk dust substructures that have been hypothesized to trace early planet formation. Using the ALMA 12-m and ACA arrays, we present new Band 7 dust continuum and molecular line observations of GY 91 at an angular resolution of (~40 au). We report detections of CS $J=6-5$, N$_2$H$^+$ $J=3-2$, C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$, H$_2$CS $J_{K_a, K_c} = 8_{1,7}-7_{1,6}$, H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$, and H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{2,3}-3_{2,2}$, as well as a tentative detection of $^{13}$C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$. We observe azimuthal asymmetry in CS and H$_2$CS emission, as well as radially structured H$_2$CO $4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ emission outside the dust continuum. C$^{18}$O and H$_2$CO 4$_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ show significant cloud contamination, while CS and N$_2$H$^+$ are good tracers of Keplerian rotation originating from the disk. Envelope emission does not appear to contribute significantly either to the continuum or molecular line observations. GY 91's chemical properties appear in large part to resemble those of Class II disks, although observations of additional molecular probes should be obtained for a fuller comparison. With CS, we estimated a dynamical stellar mass of 0.58 $M_\odot$, which is higher than previous estimates from stellar evolutionary models (0.25 $M_\odot$). Using both radiative transfer modeling of the dust continuum and comparison of the C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes to literature thermochemical models, we estimate a disk mass of $\sim0.01$ $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Development of Electroformed X-ray Optics Bridging Synchrotron Technology and Space Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed X-ray telescope mirrors using an original electroforming replication technique established through the fabrication of millimeter-aperture, ultra-short-focal-length nanofocusing mirrors for synchrotron X-ray microscopy. This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats.</description>

      <title>Continued activity of the 25th cycle: largest in 20 years. Ground-level enhancement and Forbush decrease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After a very calm 24th solar activity cycle, the 25th cycle has already seen several interesting events. A Ground Level Enhancement GLE77 was observed on 11 November 2025 following an X5.1 class solar flare. A strong Forbush decrease occurred on 19 and 20 January 2026 during one of the most intense geomagnetic storms of Solar Cycle 25. Events were recorded coherently by the global neutron monitor network and by SEVAN detectors at multiple altitudes. Using spectrometric capabilities, we reconstruct energy spectra of missing neutrons and muons during the FD and compare them with corresponding spectra measured during GLE77. The analysis demonstrates that FD and GLE signatures are intrinsically asymmetric. FDs selectively suppress the preexisting galactic cosmic ray population, whereas GLEs introduce an additional, harder particle component. Neutron and muon channels exhibit markedly different spectral behavior, particularly at higher deposited energies, reflecting their sensitivity to different primary energy ranges. These results show that combined NM and SEVAN observations provide robust, complementary diagnostics of rigidity dependent cosmic ray modulation during extreme heliospheric disturbances.</description>

      <title>CH3CCH as a thermometer in warm molecular gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic temperature is a fundamental parameter in molecular clouds. Symmetric top molecules, such as NH$_3$ and CH$_3$CCH, are often used as thermometers. However, at high temperatures, NH$_3$(2,2) can be collisionally excited to NH$_3$(2,1) and rapidly decay to NH$_3$(1,1), which can lead to an underestimation of the kinetic temperature when using rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2). In contrast, CH$_3$CCH is a symmetric top molecule with lower critical densities of its rotational levels than those of NH$_3$, which can be thermalized close to the kinetic temperature at relatively low densities of about 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. To compare the rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) and CH$_3$CCH rotational levels in warm molecular gas, we used observational data toward 55 massive star-forming regions obtained with Yebes 40m and TMRT 65m. Our results show that rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) are systematically lower than those from CH$_3$CCH 5-4. This suggests that CH$_3$CCH rotational lines with the same $J$+1$\rightarrow$$J$ quantum number may be a more reliable thermometer than NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) in warm molecular gas located in the surroundings of massive young stellar objects or, more generally, in massive star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Formalism for Impurity-Induced Resonances in Sub-barrier Proton-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental refinements of stellar reaction rates, we establish a non-perturbative Green's function formalism based on the exact solution of the Dyson equation for sub-barrier proton-nucleus resonant scattering. By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$~MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$~MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$~MeV and $1.067$~MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$~MeV and $1.058$~MeV, respectively. We demonstrate that these threshold states are characterized by a significant enhancement of the resonant cross-section, driven by the inverse relationship between the tunneling width and the spectral density peak.</description>

      <title>Predicted incidence of Jupiter-like planets around white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Only a handful of gas giant planets orbiting white dwarfs are known. It remains unclear whether this paucity reflects observational challenges or the consequences of stellar evolution. We aim to carry out population synthesis of substellar objects around white dwarfs to predict the fraction and properties of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions. We generated a representative population of white-dwarf progenitors with substellar companion and used the stellar-evolution codes MESA and SSE with standard prescriptions for mass loss and stellar tides to predict the resulting population of white dwarfs and their companions. We find that the predicted fraction of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions in the Milky Way is, independent of uncertainties related to initial distributions, stellar tides, or stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch, below ~3%. The occurrence rate peaks at relatively low-mass (~0.53 Msun to ~0.66 Msun) white dwarfs and relatively young (~1-6 Gyr) systems, where it exceeds 3%. The semimajor axes of the surviving companions range from 3-24 au. We estimate that ~95% of the predicted companions are gas-giant planets. Owing to the strong dependence of companion occurrence on the metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor, the assumed age-metallicity relation strongly affects the predictions. Based on recent estimates of the local age-metallicity relation, we estimate that the fraction of white dwarfs with companions close to the Sun might reach ~8%. If the planetary and brown dwarf companion distributions derived from intermediate-mass giant stars through radial velocity surveys reflect the characteristics of the true population, less than 3% of white dwarfs host substellar companions. This most likely represents an upper limit on possible detections because a significant number of companions might not be detectable with current facilities.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the J-method from the perspective of the AGB evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JAGB method has been proposed as a distance indicator for Local Group galaxies. We investigate the populations of the J region in the (J-K,J) colour-magnitude plane of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), aiming to distinguish general features of the J luminosity function (JLF) from those sensitive to the stellar population of each galaxy. Using a population synthesis approach based on stellar evolution and dust formation modelling, we predict the distribution of stars within the J region and compare it with observations. Stars in this region are identified as recently formed C-stars that have not yet accumulated large amounts of carbon. Typically, 2--3 $M_\odot$ stars remain longer in the J region, while lower-mass stars evolve faster. The JLF of the LMC, peaked at the expected magnitudes for these stars, confirms this picture. In the SMC, the J flux distribution is shifted to higher magnitudes, indicating an older population with lower-mass progenitors.</description>

      <title>A near-infrared stellar atlas of the Galactic plane from the VVVX survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended (VVVX) ESO public survey observed the Galactic plane and the outer Galactic bulge in the near-infrared to mitigate the effects of extinction that severely limit optical observations of these regions. By significantly expanding the area covered by the original VVV survey, VVVX enables a deeper and broader exploration of the most obscured and crowded regions of the Milky Way. We aim to extend and complete our photometric catalogs of the entire Galactic plane region accessible from the southern hemisphere, focusing on the areas newly covered by the VVVX survey. Building on previous work, we applied point-spread function fitting techniques to detect point sources and extract their deep J, H, and Ks photometry across the VVVX footprint. The resulting catalogs were calibrated using astrometric and photometric reference data. Cross-matching between filters and epochs was used to ensure a high level of reliability and completeness. We produce a deep, highly complete near-infrared catalog of more than 700 million sources in the Galactic plane and outer Galactic bulge. When combined with our previous VVV atlas, the full catalog includes over 1.5 billion sources. The derived density maps and color-magnitude diagrams enable detailed studies of Galactic structure, extinction, and stellar populations, and highlight features such as the Carina arm tangency, the Sagittarius stream, and numerous star clusters. This extended atlas provides an unprecedented view of the innermost regions of the Milky Way. It is now publicly available through the VISTA Science Archive, offering a valuable resource for the astronomical community to investigate the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk and bulge.</description>

      <title>Evolution of reconnection flux during eruption of magnetic flux ropes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powerful drivers of space weather, with magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) widely regarded as their primary precursors. However, the variation in reconnection flux during the evolution of MFR during CME eruptions remains poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic model using which we explore the temporal evolution of reconnection flux during the MFR evolution using both numerical simulations and observational data. Our initial coronal configuration features an isothermal atmosphere and a potential arcade magnetic field beneath which an MFR emerges at the lower boundary. As the MFR rises, we observe significant stretching and compression of the overlying magnetic field beneath it. Magnetic reconnection begins with the gradual formation of a current sheet, eventually culminating with the impulsive expulsion of the flux rope. We analyze the temporal evolution of reconnection fluxes during two successive MFR eruptions while continuously emerging the twisted flux rope through the lower boundary. We also conduct a similar analysis using observational data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for an eruptive event. Comparing our MHD simulation with observational data, we find that reconnection flux play a crucial role in determination of CME speeds. From the onset to the eruption, the reconnection flux shows a strong linear correlation with the velocity. This nearly realistic simulation of a solar eruption provides important insights into the complex dynamics of CME initiation and progression.</description>

      <title>Seeking Spectroscopic Binaries with Data-Driven Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven stellar classification has a long and important history in astronomy, dating as far back as Annie Jump Cannon's "by eye" classifications of stars into spectral types still used today. In recent years, data-driven spectroscopy has proven to be an effective means of deriving stellar properties for large samples of stars, sidestepping issues with computational efficiency, incomplete line lists, and radiative transfer calculations associated with physical stellar models. A logical application of these algorithms is the detection of unresolved stellar binaries, which requires accurate spectroscopic models to resolve flux contributions from a fainter secondary star in the spectrum. Here we use The Cannon to train a data-driven model on spectra from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We show that our model is competitive with existing data-driven models in its ability to predict stellar properties Teff, stellar radius, [Fe/H], vsin(i), and instrumental PSF, particularly when we apply a novel wavelet-based processing step to spectra before training. We find that even with accurate estimates of star properties, our model's ability to detect unresolved binaries is limited by its approx. 3% accuracy in per-pixel flux predictions, illuminating possible limitations of data-driven model applications.</description>

      <title>A sudden dramatic change and recovery of magneto-environment of a repeating fast radio burst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin. Some FRBs exhibit mild magneto-ionic environmental variations, possibly attributed to plasma turbulence or binary configuration. We report an abrupt magneto-ionic variation of FRB 20220529, a repeating FRB from a disk galaxy at redshift $0.1839 \pm 0.0001$. Initially, the Faraday rotation measure (RM) had a median of $17~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ and a scatter of $101~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ over 17 months. In December 2023, it jumped to $1977 \pm 84~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, and returned to typical values within two weeks. This drastic RM variation suggests that a dense magnetized clump enters and exits the line of sight in week timescales. One plausible scenario invokes a coronal mass ejection from a companion star, while other scenarios invoking extreme turbulence or binary orbital motion are also possible.</description>

Abstract: We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.</description>
