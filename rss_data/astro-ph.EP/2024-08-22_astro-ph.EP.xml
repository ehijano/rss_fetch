      <title>Properties of outer solar system pebbles during planetesimal formation from meteor observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the late stages of accretion leading up to the formation of planetesimals, particles grew to pebbles the size of 1-mm to tens of cm. That is the same size range that dominates the present-day comet mass loss. Meteoroids that size cause visible meteors on Earth. Here, we hypothesize that the size distribution and the physical and chemical properties of young meteoroid streams still contain information about the conditions in the solar nebula during these late stages of accretion. From observations of 47 young meteor showers, we find that freshly ejected meteoroids from long-period comets tend to have low bulk density and are distributed with equal surface area per log-mass interval (magnitude distribution index chi ~ 1.85), suggesting gentle accretion conditions. Jupiter-family comets, on the other hand, mostly produce meteoroids twice as dense and distributed with a steeper chi ~ 2.15 or even chi ~ 2.5, which implies that those pebbles grew from particles fragmenting in a collisional cascade or by catastrophic collisions, respectively. Both comet populations contain an admixture of compact materials that are sometimes sodium-poor, but Jupiter-family comets show a higher percentage (~8% on average) than long-period comet showers (~4%), and a wider range. While there are exceptions in both groups, the implication is that most long-period comets formed under gentle particle growth conditions, possibly near the 30 AU edge of the Trans Neptunian Disk, while most Jupiter family comets formed closer to the Sun where pebbles reached or passed the fragmentation barrier. This is possible if the Scattered Disk represents all objects scattered by Neptune during its migration, while the present-day outer Oort cloud formed only during and after the Sun had moved away from sibling stars.</description>

      <title>Gas dynamics around a Jupiter-mass planet I. Influence of protoplanetary disk properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets grow and acquire their gas envelope during the disk phase. At the time of the discovery of giant planets in their host disk, it is important to understand the interplay between the host disk and the envelope and circum-planetary disk properties of the planet. Our aim is to investigate the dynamical and physical structure of the gas in the vicinity of a Jupiter-mass planet and study how protoplanetary disk propertiesy, determine the planetary system as well as the accretion rate inside the planet's Hill sphere.We ran global 3D simulations with the grid-based code fargOCA, using a fully radiative equation of state and a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01. We explored three models. The nominal one features a disk with surface density, Sigma, corresponding to the MMSN at the planet's location, characterised by an alpha viscosity value of 0.004. The second model has a surface density ten times smaller than the nominal one and the same viscosity. In the third model, we also reduced the viscosity value by a factor of 10. During gap formation gas is heated by compression and cools according to opacity, density, and temperature values. In the analysis of our disks, we find that the gas flowing into the Hill sphere is approximately scaled as the product Sigma nu , as expected from viscous transport while The accretion rate is scaled as sqrt(Sigma nu ).Previous studies have shown that pressure or rotationally supported structures are formed around giant planets, depending on the equation of state (EoS) or on the opacity. In the case of a fully radiative EoS and a constant dust to gas ratio of 0.01, we find that low-mass and low-viscosity circum-stellar disks favour the formation of a rotationally supported circum-planetary disk. Gas accretion leading to the doubling time of the planetary system &gt;10^5 years has only been found in the case of a low-viscosity disk.</description>

      <title>Earth-like planets hosting systems: Architecture and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Earth-like planets is a major focus of current planetology research and faces a significant technological challenge. Indeed, when it comes to detecting planets as small and cold as the Earth, the cost of observation time is massive. Understanding in what type of systems Earth-like planets (ELPs) form and how to identify them is crucial for preparing future missions such as PLATO, LIFE, or others. Theoretical models suggest that ELPs predominantly form within a certain type of system architecture. Therefore, the presence or absence of ELPs could be inferred from the arrangement of other planets within the same system. This study aims to identify the profile of a typical system that harbours an ELP by investigating the architecture of systems and the properties of their innermost detectable planets. Here, we introduce a novel method for determining the architecture of planetary systems and categorising them into four distinct classes. Using three populations of synthetic planetary systems generated using the Bern model around three different types of stars, we studied the `theoretical' architecture (the architecture of a complete planetary system) and the `biased' architecture (the architecture of a system in which only detectable planets are taken into account) of the synthetic systems. The biased architecture of a system, studied in conjunction with the mass, radius, and period of the innermost detectable planet, appears to correlate with the presence or absence of an ELP in the same system. We conclude that the detections of ELPs can be predicted thanks to the already known properties of their systems, and we present a list of the properties of the systems most likely to host such a planet.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of ablating meteorite samples for improved meteoroid composition diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission spectra and diagnostic spectral features of a diverse range of ablated meteorite samples with a known composition are presented. We aim to provide a reference spectral dataset to improve our abilities to classify meteoroid composition types from meteor spectra observations. The data were obtained by ablating meteorite samples in high-enthalpy plasma wind tunnel facilities recreating conditions characteristic of low-speed meteors. Near-UV to visible-range (320 - 800 nm) emission spectra of 22 diverse meteorites captured by a high-resolution Echelle spectrometer were analyzed to identify the characteristic spectral features of individual meteorite groups. The same dataset captured by a lower-resolution meteor spectrograph was applied to compare the meteorite data with meteor spectra observations. Spectral modeling revealed that the emitting meteorite plasma was characterized by temperatures of 3700 - 4800 K, similar to the main temperature component of meteors. The studied line intensity variations were found to trace the differences in the original meteorite composition and thus can be used to constrain the individual meteorite classes. We demonstrate that meteorite composition types, including ordinary chondrites, carbonaceous chondrites, various achondrites, stony-iron and iron meteorites, can be spectrally distinguished by measuring relative line intensities of Mg I, Fe I, Na I, Cr I, Mn I, Si I, H I, CN, Ni I, and Li I. Additionally, we confirm the effect of the incomplete evaporation of refractory elements Al, Ti, and Ca, and the presence of minor species Co I, Cu I, and V I.</description>

      <title>A Search for Collisions and Planet-Disk Interactions in the Beta Pictoris Disk with 26 Years of High Precision HST/STIS Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta Pictoris (Beta Pic)'s well-studied debris disk and two known giant planets, in combination with the stability of HST/STIS (and now also JWST), offers a unique opportunity to test planet-disk interaction models and to observe recent planetesimal collisions. We present HST/STIS coronagraphic imaging from two new epochs of data taken between 2021 and 2023, complementing earlier data taken in 1997 and 2012. This dataset enables the longest baseline and highest precision temporal comparison of any debris disk to date, with sensitivity to temporal surface brightness variations of sub-percentage levels in the midplane of the disk. While no localized surface brightness changes are detected, which would be indicative of a recent planetesimal collision, there is a tentative brightening of the SE side of the disk over the past decade. We link the constraints on surface brightness variations to dynamical models of the planetary system's evolution and to the collisional history of planetesimals. Using a coupled collisional model and injection/recovery framework, we estimate sensitivity to expanding collisional debris down to a Ceres-mass per progenitor in the most sensitive regions of the disk midplane. These results demonstrate the capabilities of long-baseline, temporal studies with HST (and also soon with JWST) for constraining the physical processes occurring within debris disks.</description>

      <title>Expected Impact of Rubin Observatory LSST on NEO Follow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate and analyse the contribution of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to the rate of discovery of Near Earth Object (NEO) candidates, their submission rates to the NEO Confirmation page (NEOCP), and the resulting demands on the worldwide NEO follow-up observation system. We find that, when using current NEOCP listing criteria, Rubin will typically contribute ~129 new objects to the NEOCP each night in the first year, an increase of ~8x relative to present day. Only 8.3% of the objects listed for follow-up will be NEOs, with the primary contaminant being a background of yet undiscovered, faint, main belt asteroids (MBAs). We consider follow-up prioritisation strategies to lessen the impact on the NEO follow-up system. We develop an algorithm that predicts (with 68% accuracy) whether Rubin itself will self recover any given tracklet; external follow-up of such candidates can be de-prioritised. With this algorithm enabled, the follow-up list would be reduced to 64 NEO candidates per night (with ~8.4% purity). We propose additional criteria based on trailing, apparent magnitude, and ecliptic latitude to further prioritise follow-up. We hope observation planners and brokers will adopt some of these open-source algorithms, enabling the follow-up community to effectively keep up with the NEOCP in the early years of LSST.</description>

      <title>Climate Bistability at the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone due to Runaway Greenhouse and Cloud Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the climate dynamics at the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) is crucial for predicting the habitability of rocky exoplanets. Previous studies using Global Climate Models (GCMs) have indicated that planets receiving high stellar flux can exhibit climate bifurcations, leading to bistability between a cold (temperate) and a hot (runaway) climate. However, the mechanism causing this bistability has not been fully explained, in part due to the difficulty associated with inferring mechanisms from small numbers of expensive numerical simulations in GCMs. In this study, we employ a two-column (dayside and nightside), two-layer climate model to investigate the physical mechanisms driving this bistability. Through mechanism-denial experiments, we demonstrate that the runaway greenhouse effect, coupled with a cloud feedback on either the dayside or nightside, leads to climate bistability. We also map out the parameters that control the location of the bifurcations and size of the bistability. This work identifies which mechanisms and GCM parameters control the stellar flux at which rocky planets are likely to retain a hot, thick atmosphere if they experience a hot start. This is critical for the prioritization of targets and interpretation of observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Furthermore, our modeling framework can be extended to planets with different condensable species and cloud types.</description>

      <title>RIS-Vis: A Novel Visualization Platform for Seismic, Geodetic, and Weather Data Relevant to Antarctic Cryosphere Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antarctic ice shelves play a vital role in preserving the physical conditions of the Antarctic cryosphere and the Southern Ocean, and beyond. By serving as a buttressing force, ice shelves prevent sea-level rise by restraining the flow of continental ice and glaciers to the sea. Sea-level rise impacts the global environment in multiple ways, including flooding habitats, eroding coastlines, and contaminating soil and groundwater. It is therefore essential to monitor the stability of Antarctic ice shelves, for which a variety of complementary data sources is required. We have developed RIS-Vis, a novel data visualization platform to monitor Antarctic ice shelves. Although focused on the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), RIS-Vis could be readily scaled to monitor other ice shelves around Antarctica, and elsewhere. Currently, RIS-Vis is capable of analyzing and visualizing seismic, geodetic, and weather data to provide meaningful information for Antarctic cryosphere research. RIS-Vis was built using Python libraries including Obspy, APScheduler, and the Plotly Dash framework, and uses SQLite as the backing database. Visualizations developed on RIS-Vis include filtered seismic waveforms, spectrograms, and power spectral densities, geodetic-based ice-shelf flow, and meteorological variables such as atmospheric temperature and pressure. The dashboard visualization platform abstracts away the time-intensive analysis process of raw data and allows scientists to better concentrate on RIS science.</description>

      <title>The Prevalence of Resonance Among Young, Close-in Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple planets undergoing disk migration may be captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances with the innermost planet parked near the disk's inner edge. Subsequent dynamical evolution may disrupt these resonances, leading to the non-resonant configurations typically observed among {\it Kepler} planets that are Gyrs old. In this scenario, resonant configurations are expected to be more common in younger systems. This prediction can now be tested, thanks to recent discoveries of young planets, particularly those in stellar clusters, by NASA's {\it TESS} mission. We divided the known planetary systems into three age groups: young ($&lt;$100-Myr-old), adolescent (0.1-1-Gyr-old), and mature ($&gt;1$-Gyr-old). The fraction of neighboring planet pairs having period ratios within a few percent of a first-order commensurability (e.g.~4:3, 3:2, or 2:1) is 70$\pm$15\% for young pairs, 24$\pm$8\% for adolescent pairs, and 15$\pm$2\% for mature pairs. The fraction of systems with at least one nearly commensurable pair (either first or second-order) is 86$\pm13$\% among young systems, 38$\pm12$\% for adolescent systems, and 23$\pm3$\% for mature systems. First-order commensurabilities prevail across all age groups, with an admixture of second-order commensurabilities. Commensurabilities are more common in systems with high planet multiplicity and low mutual inclinations. Observed period ratios often deviate from perfect commensurability by $\sim$1\% even among young planets, too large to be explained by resonant repulsion with equilibrium eccentricity tides. We also find that super-Earths in the radius gap ($1.5-1.9R_\oplus$) are less likely to be near-resonant (11.9$\pm2.0\%$) compared to Earth-sized planets ($R_p&lt;1R_\oplus$; 25.3$\pm4.4\%$) or mini-Neptunes ($1.9R_\oplus \leq R_p&lt;2.5R_\oplus$; 14.4$\pm1.8\%$).</description>

      <title>TESS discovery of two super-Earths orbiting the M-dwarf stars TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 near the radius valley</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the validation of two TESS super-Earth candidates transiting the mid-M dwarfs TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 every 10.90 and 10.44 days, respectively. The first star (TOI-6002) is located $32.038\pm0.019$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2409^{+0.0066}_{-0.0065} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2105^{+0.0049}_{-0.0048} M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3229^{+77}_{-57}$ K. The second star (TOI-5713) is located $40.946\pm0.032$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2985^{+0.0073}_{-0.0072} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2653\pm0.0061 M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3225^{+41}_{-40}$ K. We validated the planets using TESS data, ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from many ground-based facilities, as well as high-resolution AO observations from Keck/NIRC2. TOI-6002 b has a radius of $1.65^{+0.22}_{-0.19} R_\oplus$ and receives $1.77^{+0.16}_{-0.11} S_\oplus$. TOI-5713 b has a radius of $1.77_{-0.11}^{+0.13} R_\oplus$ and receives $2.42\pm{0.11} S_\oplus$. Both planets are located near the radius valley and near the inner edge of the habitable zone of their host stars, which makes them intriguing targets for future studies to understand the formation and evolution of small planets around M-dwarf stars.</description>
