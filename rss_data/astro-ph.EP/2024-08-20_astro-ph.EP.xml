      <title>Microphysical Prescriptions for Parameterized Water Cloud Formation on Ultra-cool Substellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely-used EddySed cloud model (Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001) for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable $f_{sed}$ parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically-informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Pursuing Truth: Improving Retrievals on Mid-Infrared Exo-Earth Spectra with Physically Motivated Water Abundance Profiles and Cloud Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds affect retrievals. In a first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure-temperature structure, and the abundances of $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, and $\mathrm{O_3}$. Further, at $R=100$, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature $\mathrm{CH_4}$ becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dust accumulation of the PDS 70 disk revealed by ALMA Band 3 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PDS 70 system, hosting two planets within its disk, is an ideal target for examining the effect of planets on dust accumulation, growth, and ongoing planet formation. Here, we present high-resolution ($0.''07 = 8 \ \mathrm{au}$) dust continuum observations of the PDS 70 disk in ALMA Band 3 (3.0 mm). While previous Band 7 observations showed a dust ring with slight asymmetry, our Band 3 observations reveal a more prominent asymmetric peak in the northwest direction, where the intensity is 2.5 times higher than in other directions and the spectral index is at the local minimum with $\alpha_{\mathrm{SED}} \sim 2.2$. This indicates that a substantial amount of dust is accumulated both radially and azimuthally in the peak. We also detect point-source emission around the stellar position in the Band 3 image, which is likely to be free-free emission. We constrain the eccentricity of the outer ring to be $e&lt;0.04$ from the position of the central star and the outer ring. From the comparison with numerical simulations, we constrain the mass of PDS 70c to be less than 4.9 Jupiter masses if the gas turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}} = 10^{-3}$. Then, we discuss the formation mechanism of the disk structures and further planet formation scenarios in the disk.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Habitability and Stellar Habitable Zones from Observed Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of exoplanetary habitability is integral to advancing our knowledge of extraterrestrial life potential and detailing the environmental conditions of distant worlds. In this analysis, we explore the properties of exoplanets situated with respect to circumstellar habitable zones by implementing a sophisticated filtering methodology on data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This research encompasses a thorough examination of 5,595 confirmed exoplanets listed in the Archive as of March 10th, 2024, systematically evaluated according to their calculated surface temperatures and stellar classifications of their host stars, taking into account the biases implicit in the methodologies used for their discovery. Our findings elucidate distinctive patterns in exoplanetary attributes, which are significantly shaped by the spectral classifications and mass of the host stars. The insights garnered from our study not only enhance the existing models for managing burgeoning exoplanetary datasets, but also lay foundational groundwork for future explorations into the dynamic relationships between exoplanets and their stellar environments.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way's Thick Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (${\lesssim}$1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way's thick disk are ${\sim}50\%$ less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift $z {\sim}2$), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ${\sim}7$ orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ${\sim}$0.2--0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ${\gtrsim}$Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk vs.~thin disk.</description>

      <title>Global weather map reveals persistent top-of-atmosphere features on the nearest brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions display rotationally modulated photometric variability, especially those near the L/T transition. This variability is commonly attributed to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) inhomogeneities, with proposed models including patchy thick and thin clouds, planetary-scale jets, or chemical disequilibrium. Surface mapping techniques are powerful tools to probe their atmospheric structures and distinguish between models. One of the most successful methods for stellar surface mapping is Doppler imaging, where the existence of TOA inhomogeneities can be inferred from their varying Doppler shifts across the face of a rotating star. We applied Doppler imaging to the nearest brown dwarf binary WISE 1049AB (aka Luhman 16AB) using time-resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observations from Gemini IGRINS, and obtained for the first time H and K band simultaneous global weather map for brown dwarfs. Compared to the only previous Doppler map for a brown dwarf in 2014 featuring a predominant mid-latitude cold spot on WISE 1049B and no feature on WISE 1049A, our observations detected persistent spot-like structures on WISE 1049B in the equatorial to mid-latitude regions on two nights, and revealed new polar spots on WISE 1049A. Our results suggest stability of atmospheric features over timescale of days and possible long-term stable or recurring structures. H and K band maps displayed similar structures in and out of CO bands, indicating the cold spots not solely due to chemical hotspots but must involve clouds. Upcoming 30-m extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will enable more sensitive Doppler imaging of dozens of brown dwarfs and even a small number of directly-imaged exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Jupiter Analog Misaligned to the Inner Planetary System in HD 73344</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a Jupiter-like planet, HD 73344 d ($m_{d}=2.55^{+0.56}_{-0.46}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{d}=6.70^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ AU, $e_{d}=0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) based on 27-year radial velocity observations. HD 73344 also hosts a compact inner planetary system, including a transiting sub-Neptune HD 73344 b ($P_{b}=15.61\ \mathrm{days}$, $r_{b}=2.88^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\ \mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and a non-transiting Saturn-mass planet ($P_{c}=65.936\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{c}\sin{i_c}=0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$). By analyzing TESS light curves, we identified a stellar rotation period of $9.03\pm{1.3}$ days. Combining this with $v\sin{i_*}$ measurements from stellar spectra, we derived a stellar inclination of $63.6^{+17.4}_{-16.5}\ \rm{deg} $. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we characterized the three-dimensional orbit of the outer giant planet and constrained its mutual inclination relative to the innermost transiting planet to be $46 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 134\ \rm{deg}\ (1\sigma)$ and $20 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 160\ \rm{deg}\ (2\sigma)$, strongly disfavoring coplanar architectures. Our analytical calculations and N-body simulation reveal that the two inner planets are strongly coupled with each other and undergo nodal precession together around the orbital axis of the giant planet. During nodal precession, the orbital inclination of inner planets oscillate with time and therefore become misaligned relative to the stellar spin axis. The formation of such systems suggests a history of planet-planet scattering or misalignment between the inner and outer components of protoplanetary disks. The upcoming release of Gaia DR4 will uncover more systems similar to HD 73344 and enable the study of the flatness of exoplanet systems with a mixture of inner and outer planetary systems on a statistical level.</description>

      <title>Obliquities of Exoplanet Host Stars: 19 New and Updated Measurements, and Trends in the Sample of 205 Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the obliquities in exoplanet systems have revealed some remarkable architectures, some of which are very different from the Solar System. Nearly 200 obliquity measurements have been obtained through observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Here we report on observations of 19 planetary systems that led to 17 clear detections of the RM effect and 2 less secure detections. After adding the new measurements to the tally, we use the entire collection of RM measurements to investigate four issues that have arisen in the literature. i) Does the obliquity distribution show a peak at approximately 90$^\circ$? We find tentative evidence that such a peak does exist when restricting attention to the sample of sub-Saturn planets and hot Jupiters orbiting F stars. ii) Are high obliquities associated with high eccentricities? We find the association to be weaker than previously reported, and that a stronger association exists between obliquity and orbital separation, possibly due to tidal obliquity damping at small separations. iii) How low are the lowest known obliquities? Among hot Jupiters around cool stars, we find the dispersion to be $1.4\pm0.7^\circ$, smaller than the 6$^\circ$ obliquity of the Sun, which serves as additional evidence for tidal damping. iv) What are the obliquities of stars with compact and flat systems of multiple planets? We find that they generally have obliquities lower than $10^\circ$, with several remarkable exceptions possibly caused by wide-orbiting stellar or planetary companions.</description>

      <title>Ocean Circulation on Tide-locked Lava Worlds, Part II: Scalings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On tidally locked lava planets, magma ocean can form on the permanent dayside. The circulation of the magma ocean can be driven by stellar radiation and atmospheric winds. The strength of ocean circulation and the depth of the magma ocean depend on external forcings and the dominant balance of the momentum equation. In this study, we develop scaling laws for the magma ocean depth, oceanic current speed, and ocean heat transport convergence driven by stellar and wind forcings in three different dynamic regimes: non-rotating viscosity-dominant Regime I, non-rotating inviscid limit Regime II, and rotation-dominant Regime III. Scaling laws suggest that magma ocean depth, current speed, and ocean heat transport convergence are controlled by various parameters, including vertical diffusivity/viscosity, substellar temperature, planetary rotation rate, and wind stress. In general, scaling laws predict that magma ocean depth ranges from a few meters to a few hundred meters. For Regime I, results from scaling laws are further confirmed by numerical simulations. Considering the parameters of a typical lava super-Earth, we found that the magma ocean is most likely in the rotation-dominant Regime III.</description>

      <title>Ocean Circulation on Tide-locked Lava Worlds, Part I: An Idealized 2D Numerical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magma ocean is expected to exist on the dayside of tide-locked planets if surface temperature exceeds the melting temperature of typical crust. As highly prioritized targets for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), more information about the surface and atmosphere of lava planets will soon be available. In most previous studies of lava planets, the system is typically assumed to be vigorously convecting and isentropic. This implies a magma ocean depth reaching $O$($10^4$--$10^5$) m, determined by the adiabats and melting curves. In this study, we aim to simulate ocean circulation and ocean depth on tidally locked lava worlds using an idealized 2D (x-z) model developed by the authors. Our simulation results show that under zero or a small internal source, the maximum zonal current speed ranges from 0.1--1.0 m s$^{-1}$ and the magma ocean depth remains $O$(100) m, being more than 100 times shallower than that predicted in a fully convecting system. We demonstrate that the ocean heat transport divergence is consistently smaller than the stellar insolation by 1--2 orders of magnitude. Consequently, the impact of ocean circulation on the thermal phase curve of tidally locked lava worlds is minimal in observations.</description>

      <title>Single-Star Warm-Jupiter Systems Tend to Be Aligned, Even Around Hot Stellar Hosts: No $T_{\rm eff}-\lambda$ Dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar obliquity distribution of warm-Jupiter systems is crucial for constraining the dynamical history of Jovian exoplanets, as the warm Jupiters' tidal detachment likely preserves their primordial obliquity. However, the sample size of warm-Jupiter systems with measured stellar obliquities has historically been limited compared to that of hot Jupiters, particularly in hot-star systems. In this work, we present newly obtained sky-projected stellar obliquity measurements for warm-Jupiter systems, TOI-559, TOI-2025, TOI-2031, TOI-2485, TOI-2524, and TOI-3972, derived from the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, and show that all six systems display alignment with a median measurement uncertainty of 13 degrees. Combining these new measurements with the set of previously reported stellar obliquity measurements, our analysis reveals that single-star warm-Jupiter systems tend to be aligned, even around hot stellar hosts. This alignment exhibits a 3.4-$\sigma$ deviation from the $T_{\rm eff}-\lambda$ dependency observed in hot-Jupiter systems, where planets around cool stars tend to be aligned, while those orbiting hot stars show considerable misalignment. The current distribution of spin-orbit measurements for Jovian exoplanets indicates that misalignments are neither universal nor primordial phenomena affecting all types of planets. The absence of misalignments in single-star warm-Jupiter systems further implies that many hot Jupiters, by contrast, have experienced a dynamically violent history.</description>

      <title>Fringing analysis and forward modeling of Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combines high contrast imaging with high resolution spectroscopy (R$\sim$35,000 in K band) to study directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs in unprecedented detail. KPIC aims to spectrally characterize substellar companions through measurements of planetary radial velocities, spins, and atmospheric composition. Currently, the dominant source of systematic noise for KPIC is fringing, or oscillations in the spectrum as a function of wavelength. The fringing signal can dominate residuals by up to 10% of the continuum for high S/N exposures, preventing accurate wavelength calibration, retrieval of atmospheric parameters, and detection of planets with flux ratios less than 1% of the host star. To combat contamination from fringing, we first identify its three unique sources and adopt a physically informed model of Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavities to apply to post-processed data. We find this strategy can effectively model the fringing in observations of A0V/F0V stars, reducing the residual systematics caused by fringing by a factor of 2. Next, we wedge two of the transmissive optics internal to KPIC to eliminate two sources of fringing and confirm the third source as the entrance window to the spectrograph. Finally, we apply our previous model of the Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity to new data taken with the wedged optics to reduce the amplitude of the residuals by a factor of 10.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At least two global "Snowball Earth" glaciations occurred during the Neoproterozoic Era (1000-538.8 million years ago). Post-glacial surface environments during this time are recorded in cap carbonates: layers of limestone or dolostone that directly overlie glacial deposits. Postulated environmental conditions that created the cap carbonates lack consensus largely because single hypotheses fail to explain the cap carbonates' global mass, depositional timescales, and geochemistry of parent waters. Here, we present a global geologic carbon cycle model before, during, and after the second glaciation (i.e. the Marinoan) that explains cap carbonate characteristics. We find a three-stage process for cap carbonate formation: (1) low-temperature seafloor weathering during glaciation generates deep-sea alkalinity; (2) vigorous post-glacial continental weathering supplies alkalinity to a carbonate-saturated freshwater layer, rapidly precipitating cap carbonates; (3) mixing of post-glacial meltwater with deep-sea alkalinity prolongs cap carbonate deposition. We suggest how future geochemical data and modeling refinements could further assess our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The Resonant Remains of Broken Chains from Major and Minor Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and Kepler have revealed that practically all close-in sub-Neptunes form in mean-motion resonant chains, most of which unravel on timescales of 100 Myr. Using a series of N-body integrations, we study how planetary collisions resulting from the destabilization of resonant chains produce the distribution of orbital periods observed among mature systems, focusing on the resonant fine structures that remain post-instability. In their natal chains, planets near first-order resonances have period ratios just wide of perfect commensurability, driven there by disk migration and eccentricity damping. Sufficiently large resonant libration amplitudes (of unknown origin) are needed to trigger instability. Ensuing collisions between planets ("major mergers") erode but do not completely eliminate resonant pairs; survivors which avoid mergers show up as narrow "peaks" just wide of commensurability in the histogram of neighboring-planet period ratios. Merger products exhibit a broad range of period ratios, with each resonant peak in the histogram spawning a continuum of ratios wide of the given resonance. These continua may fill in period ratios between relatively closely separated resonances such as the 5:4, 4:3, and 3:2, but may fail to bridge the relatively wide gap between the 3:2 and the 2:1. Thus a "trough" manifests just short of the 2:1 resonance (and only the 2:1 resonance), as observed. Major mergers are not perfect, and generate collisional debris which undergoes "minor mergers" with planets, in many cases further widening resonant pairs. With all this dynamical activity, free eccentricities of resonant pairs, and by extension the phases of their transit timing variations (TTVs), are readily excited. Because non-resonant planets are merger products, they are predicted to have higher masses than resonant planets.</description>

      <title>Multiband polarimetric imaging of HD 34700 with SCExAO/CHARIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Subaru/SCExAO + CHARIS broadband (JHK) integral field spectroscopy of HD 34700 A in polarized light. CHARIS has the unique ability to obtain polarized integral field images at 22 wavelength channels in broadband, as the incoming light is first split into different polarization states before passing though the lenslet array. We recover the transition disk around HD 34700 A in multiband polarized light in our data. We combine our polarized intensity data with previous total intensity data to examine the scattering profiles, scattering phase functions and polarized fraction of the disk at multiple wavelengths. We also carry out 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of the disk using MCFOST, and make qualitative comparisons between our models and data to constrain dust grain properties. We find that in addition to micron-sized dust grains, a population of sub-micron grains is needed to match the surface brightness in polarized light and polarized fraction. This could indicate the existence of a population of small grains in the disk, or it could be caused by Mie theory simulations using additional small grains to compensate for sub-micron structures of real dust aggregates. We find models that match the polarized fraction of the data but the models do not apply strong constraints on the dust grain type or compositions. We find no models that can match all observed properties of the disk. More detailed modeling using realistic dust aggregates with irregular surfaces and complex structures is required to further constrain the dust properties.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Effect of Tilted Corner Cube Reflector Arrays on Lunar Laser Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the effect of the tilt of corner cube reflector (CCR) arrays on lunar laser ranging (LLR). A mathematical model was established to study the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR arrays. The study found that, ideally, when the laser ranging pulse width is 10 picoseconds or less, it is possible to distinguish from which specific corner cubes within the CCR array each peak in the echo signal originates. Consequently, partial data from the echo can be extracted for signal processing, significantly reducing random errors and improving the single-shot precision of LLR. The distance obtained by extracting part of the echo can be reduced to the center position of the array, thereby providing multiple higher-precision ranging results from each measurement. This not only improves the precision of LLR but also increases the data volume. A simulation experiment based on the 1.2 m laser ranging system at Yunnan Observatories was conducted. By extracting one peak for signal processing, the single-shot precision improved from 32.24 mm to 2.52 mm, validating the theoretical analysis results. Finally, an experimental laser ranging system based on a 53 cm binocular telescope system was established for ground experiments. The experimental results indicated that the echo signal could identify the tilt state of the CCR array. By extracting the peak returned by the central CCR for signal processing, the ranging precision was greatly improved. Through theoretical analyses, simulation experiments, and ground experiments, a solution to reduce the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR array was provided. This offers an approach to enhance the single-shot precision of future LLR and provides a reference for upgrading ground-based equipment at future laser ranging stations.</description>

      <title>On the Age and Metallicity of Planet-hosting Triple Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the ages and metallicities of triple stellar systems that are known to host exoplanets. With controversial cases disregarded, so far 27 of those systems have been identified. Our analysis, based on an exploratory approach, shows that those systems are on average notably younger than stars situated in the solar neighborhood. Though the statistical significance of this result is not fully established, the most plausible explanation is a possible double selection effect due to the relatively high mass of planet-hosting stars of those systems (which spend less time on the main-sequence than low-mass stars) and that planets in triple stellar systems may be long-term orbitally unstable. The stellar metallicities are on average solar-like; however, owing to the limited number of data, this result is not inconsistent with the previous finding that stars with planets tend to be metal-rich as the deduced metallicity distribution is relatively broad.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Primordial Alignment: Insights from Stellar Obliquity Measurements for Compact Sub-Saturn Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of effort, the mechanisms by which the spin axis of a star and the orbital axes of its planets become misaligned remain elusive. Particularly, it is of great interest whether the large spin-orbit misalignments observed are driven primarily by high-eccentricity migration -- expected to have occurred for short-period, isolated planets -- or reflect a more universal process that operates across systems with a variety of present-day architectures. Compact multi-planet systems offer a unique opportunity to differentiate between these competing hypotheses, as their tightly-packed configurations preclude violent dynamical histories, including high-eccentricity migration, allowing them to trace the primordial disk plane. In this context, we report measurements of the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for two sub-Saturns in multiple-transiting systems: TOI-5126 b ($\lambda=1\pm 48 ^\circ$) and TOI-5398 b ($\lambda=-8.1^{+5.3 \circ}_{-6.3}$). Both are spin-orbit aligned, joining a fast-growing group of just three other compact sub-Saturn systems, all of which exhibit spin-orbit alignment. In aggregate with archival data, our results strongly suggest that sub-Saturn systems are primordially aligned and become misaligned largely in the post-disk phase, as appears to be the case increasingly for other exoplanet populations.</description>
