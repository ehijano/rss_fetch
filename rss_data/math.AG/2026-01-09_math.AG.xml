      <title>Torelli loci, product cycles, and the homomorphism conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tautological $\mathbb{Q}$-subalgebra $\mathsf{R}^*(\mathcal{A}_g) \subset \mathsf{CH}^*(\mathcal{A}_g)$ of the Chow ring of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties is generated by the Chern classes of the Hodge bundle. There is a canonical $\mathbb{Q}$-linear projection operator $\mathsf{taut}: \mathsf{CH}^*(\mathcal{A}_g) \rightarrow \mathsf{R}^*(\mathcal{A}_g).$ We present here new calculations of intersection products of the Torelli locus in $\mathcal{A}_g$ with the product loci $\mathcal{A}_{r}\times \mathcal{A}_{g-r} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}_g$ for $r\leq 3$. The results suggest that $\mathsf{taut}$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra homomorphism, at least for special cycles. We discuss a conjectural framework for this homomorphism property.
  Our calculations follow two independent approaches. The first is a direct study of the excess intersection geometry of the fiber product of the Torelli and product morphisms. The second recasts the geometry in terms of families Gromov-Witten classes, which are computed by a wall-crossing formula related to unramified maps.
  We define tautological projections of cycles on the fiber products $\mathcal X_g^s \to \mathcal A_g$ of the universal family. We compute these projections for a class of product cycles on $\mathcal X_g^s$ in terms of a determinant involving the universal theta divisors and Poincar\'e classes. Using Abel-Jacobi pullbacks of product cycles on $\mathcal X_g^s$ and their projections, we construct a new family of classes which we conjecture to lie in the Gorenstein kernels of the tautological rings $\mathsf{R}^*(\mathcal M^{\mathrm{ct}}_{g,n})$. In particular, we construct a nontrivial element of the Gorenstein kernel of $\mathsf{R}^5(\mathcal{M}_{5,2}^{\mathrm{ct}})$.</description>

      <title>Elimination Without Eliminating: Computing Complements of Real Hypersurfaces Using Pseudo-Witness Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many hypersurfaces in algebraic geometry, such as discriminants, arise as the projection of another variety. The real complement of such a hypersurface partitions its ambient space into open regions. In this paper, we propose a new method for computing these regions. Existing methods for computing regions require the explicit equation of the hypersurface as input. However, computing this equation by elimination can be computationally demanding or even infeasible. Our approach instead derives from univariate interpolation by computing the intersection of the hypersurface with a line. Such an intersection can be done using so-called pseudo-witness sets without computing a defining equation for the hypersurface - we perform elimination without actually eliminating. We implement our approach in a forthcoming Julia package and demonstrate, on several examples, that the resulting algorithm accurately recovers all regions of the real complement of a hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal Variations of Hodge Structure for Singular Curves I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the infinitesimal variation of Hodge structure associated with families of reduced algebraic curves with singularities. The analysis applies to curves beyond the nodal case and is not restricted to plane curves, encompassing curves lying on smooth projective surfaces as well as families with more general isolated singularities. Using deformation-theoretic and residue-theoretic methods, we describe how the infinitesimal period map decomposes into local contributions supported at singular points, together with global constraints arising from the geometry of the normalization. While nodal singularities give rise to nontrivial rank-one contributions, other singularities may contribute only through higher-order local data or may be invisible at the infinitesimal level. As a consequence, we obtain sharp criteria for maximal infinitesimal variation in terms of numerical invariants of the curve, notably when the number of nodes satisfies the inequality $\delta \ge g$, where $g$ denotes the genus of the normalization.
  We extend these results to curves on very general surfaces in projective three-space, showing that maximal variation persists on Picard-rank-one surfaces but fails for sufficiently large genus in the presence of higher ADE singularities. These results extend classical maximality phenomena in infinitesimal Hodge theory to a broader singular and geometric setting.</description>

      <title>On automorphisms of $p$-torsion $\mathbf{G}_m$-gerbes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Olsson showed in [Ols25] that if $\mathcal{X} \to X$ is a $\mathbf{G}_m$-gerbe over a smooth projective variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ such that the Brauer class of $\mathcal{X}$ has order prime to the characteristic of $k$, then the homomorphism of $k$-group algebraic spaces $\operatorname{Aut}^0_{\mathcal{X}} \to \operatorname{Aut}^0_X$ is surjective. We provide an example to show that this need not be the case when the Brauer class of $\mathcal{X}$ has order equal to the characteristic. Our main tools are deformation theory of the fppf sheafified Artin--Mazur formal groups and nice properties of the flat cohomology of ordinary varieties in positive characteristic which are presumably well-known, but which we collect and give an exposition of here. We additionally prove some sufficient conditions for surjectivity of $\operatorname{Aut}^0_{\mathcal{X}} \to \operatorname{Aut}^0_X$ using representability results of Bragg and Olsson.</description>

      <title>Maximal Variation in the Moduli of Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the maximal-variation locus in families and moduli spaces of projective curves, defined via conductor-level balancing of meromorphic differentials on the normalization. This notion captures precisely when the space of canonical differentials behaves with the expected dimension under degeneration. We prove semicontinuity and openness results showing that maximal variation is stable in flat families, identify a natural determinantal degeneracy locus where maximal variation fails, and establish that this failure is governed entirely by the presence of non-Gorenstein singularities. In particular, all smooth and nodal curves satisfy maximal variation, while every non-Gorenstein singularity contributes explicitly and additively to degeneracy. We compute the expected codimension of degeneracy loci, describe their closure and adjacency relations in moduli, and explain how non-Gorenstein defects give rise to additional Hodge-theoretic phenomena in degenerations. This framework provides a uniform, intrinsic, and deformation-theoretically meaningful classification of degeneracy in spaces of canonical differentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Waring problem of harmonic polynomials. By characterizing the annihilating ideal of a homogeneous harmonic polynomial, i.e., a real binary form that is in the kernel of the Laplacian, we show that its Waring rank equals its degree. Moreover, we show that any linear form can appear in a minimal Waring decomposition of a homogeneous harmonic polynomial, implying that the forbidden locus is empty. We also provide an explicit algorithm for computing the minimal Waring decompositions.</description>

      <title>New gap principle for semiabelian varieties using globally valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hrushovski observed that the new gap principle of Gao-Ge-K\"uhne is essentially equivalent to the Bogomolov conjecture over arbitrary globally valued fields of characteristic $0$. Building on this observation, we prove a new gap principle for semiabelian varieties by reducing the Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties to the Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties over arbitrary GVFs. This reduction remains valid in positive characteristic; however, the corresponding Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties is not yet known in that setting. We prove an unconditional new gap principle in positive characteristic for semiabelian varieties whose abelian quotient is an elliptic curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.14453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define logarithmic tangent sheaves associated with complete intersections in connection with Jacobian syzygies and distributions. We analyse the notions of local freeness, freeness and stability of these sheaves. We carry out a complete study of logarithmic sheaves associated with pencils of quadrics and compute their projective dimension from the classical invariants such as the Segre symbol and new invariants (splitting type and degree vector) designed for the classification of irregular pencils. This leads to a complete classification of free (equivalently, locally free) pencils of quadrics. Finally we produce examples of locally free, non free pencils of surfaces in P3 of any degree k at least 3, answering (in the negative) a question of Calvo-Andrade, Cerveau, Giraldo and Lins Neto about codimension foliations on P3 .</description>

      <title>The point insertion technique and open $r$-spin theories I: moduli and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The papers [3,1,4,10] constructed an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin disks, and proved it satisfies mirror symmetry and relations with integrable hierarchies. That theory considered only disks with a single boundary state. In this work, we initiate the study of more general $r$-spin surfaces. We define graded $r$-spin surfaces with multiple internal and boundary states, together with their moduli spaces.
  In genus zero, the disk case, we define the associated open Witten bundle and prove that it is canonically oriented relative to the moduli space. We also describe a gluing construction for moduli spaces along boundaries, show that it lifts to the Witten bundle and relative cotangent line bundles, and that the result remains canonically relatively oriented.
  We then study the genus-one cylinder case. Here foundational difficulties arise because the Witten "bundle" is no longer an orbifold vector bundle. We resolve this by removing strata with incorrect fibre dimension, obtaining an orbibundle on the complement. The gluing method extends to genus one, and we prove that the Witten bundle again admits a canonical relative orientation.
  In the sequel [20], we construct a family of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ intersection theories in genus-zero indexed by $\mathfrak h\in\{0,\ldots,\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1\}$, where the $\mathfrak h$-th theory has $\mathfrak h+1$ boundary states, and compute their intersection numbers. The case $\mathfrak h=0$ recovers the theory of [3,1].
  In the sequel [21], restricting to the $\mathfrak h=0$ case, we construct an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin cylinders and show that its potential yields, after a change of variables, the genus-one part of the $r$th Gelfand-Dikii wave function, proving the genus-one case of the main conjecture of [4].</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and deformations of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties can have moduli. To be precise, suppose $X$ is a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of codimension $1$ in the flag variety $G/B$, where $G$ is a simple algebraic group of rank $r$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and $B$ is a Borel subgroup. We show that the space~$\mathrm{H}^1(X,TX)$ of first order deformations of $X$ has dimension $r-1$ except in type $A_2$. (In type $A_2$, the Hessenberg varieties in question are all isomorphic to the permutohedral toric surface, and $\dim\mathrm{H}^1(X,TX) = 0$.) Moreover, we show that the Kodaira--Spencer map $\mathfrak{g}\to \mathrm{H}^1(X,TX)$ is onto, that the identity component of the automorphism group of $X$ is a maximal torus of $G$, and that $\mathrm{H}^i(X,TX) = 0$ for $i \geq 2$. Along the way, we prove several theorems of independent interest about the cohomology of homogeneous vector bundles on~$G/B$.
  In type $A$, we can give an even more precise statement determining when two codimension $1$ regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties in $G/B$ are isomorphic. We also compute the automorphism groups explicitly in type~$A_{n-1}$ in the terms of stabilizer subgroups of the action of the symmetric group $S_{n}$ on the moduli space $M_{0,n+1}$ of smooth genus $0$ curves with $n + 1$ marked points. Using this, we describe the moduli stack of the regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties $X$ explicitly as a quotient stack of $M_{0,n+1}$.
  We prove several analogous results for Hessenberg varieties in generalized flag varieties $G/P$, where $P$ is a parabolic subgroup of $G$. In type $A$, these results are used in the proofs of the results for $G/B$, but they are also of independent interest because the associated moduli stacks are related directly to the action of $S_n$ on $M_{0,n}$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a projective K-moduli space of quasimaps with a certain log Fano condition, which is regarded as a rational map from $\mathbb{P}^1$ to a projective space. Moreover, we investigate relationships between the K-moduli of quasimaps and the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves of negative Kodaira dimension constructed by the authors when general fibers are Abelian varieties or irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. As an application, we obtain the entire quasi-projectivity of the seminormalization and the ampleness of the CM line bundle on the normalization of the K-moduli space of Calabi-Yau fibrations in this case.</description>

Abstract: We consider the countably many families $\mathcal{L}_d$, $d\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$, of K3 surfaces admitting an elliptic fibration with positive Mordell--Weil rank. We prove that the elliptic fibrations on the very general member of these families have the potential Mordell--Weil rank jump property for $d\neq 2,3$ and moreover the Mordell--Weil rank jump property for $d\equiv 3\mod 4$, $d\neq 3$. We provide explicit examples and discuss some extensions to subfamilies. The result is based on the geometric interaction between the (potential) Mordell--Weil rank jump property and the presence of special multisections of the fibration.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Elliptic Curves via Elliptic Gromov-Witten Invariants of Four Dimensional Projective Fano Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24357v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a conjecture that clarifies the relationship between the number of degree d elliptic curves in complex four-dimensional projective Fano hypersurfaces and their degree d elliptic Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants. The elliptic GW invariants are computed using the elliptic virtual structure constants proposed in our previous works.</description>

      <title>Free curves and fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that klt Fano varieties and certain lc Fano varieties contain free higher-genus curves in their smooth loci. Our methods also allow us to find free curves on varieties in positive characteristic and on quasiprojective varieties, under a natural positivity condition on the tangent bundle. We then use the existence of free curves to deduce finiteness of the fundamental group of the smooth locus in these settings.
  The paper includes an appendix by de Jong that establishes the K\"unneth formula for tame \'etale fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of cluster type varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study degenerations of cluster type varieties and pairs. Our first theorem proves that degenerations of toric pairs are finite quotients of toric pairs. In a similar vein, under some mild conditions, we prove that degenerations of cluster type pairs are finite quotients of cluster type pairs. Then, we focus on degenerations of cluster type surfaces. We give some general criteria for the existence of $1$-complements on degenerations of toric surfaces. We prove that for almost all $(a,b,c)\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}^3$ the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(a,b,c)$ has no non-trivial degenerations. In particular, for a Markov triple $(a,b,c)\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}^3$, we prove that $\mathbb{P}(a^2,b^2,c^2)$ admits no non-trivial degenerations. Finally, we give a complete classification of the degenerations of $\mathbb{P}(1,1,n)$ for $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>AKSZ construction for shifted Poisson structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the AKSZ theorem for shifted Poisson structures: if $X$ is an $n$-shifted Poisson derived stack, and $Y$ a $d$-oriented derived stack, then the mapping stack \[\underline{\mathrm{Map}}(Y,X)\] is naturally endowed with an $(n-d)$-shifted Poisson structure. For this, we prove that the data of an $n$-shifted Poisson structure on a derived Artin stack is equivalent to the data of an $(n+1)$-shifted Lagrangian thickening of it. We also extend the definition of shifted Poisson structures to derived prestacks having a deformation theory and give two applications, one for mapping stacks with a non-proper source and one in BV formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every automorphism of the congruence completion of the extended mapping class group that preserves the set of conjugacy classes of procyclic groups generated by Dehn twists is inner, and that its automorphism group is naturally isomorphic to the automorphism group of the procongruence pants complex. In the genus-zero case, we prove the stronger result that all automorphisms of the profinite completion of the extended mapping class group are inner.</description>

      <title>Locally recoverable algebro-geometric codes from projective bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A code is locally recoverable when each symbol in one of its code words can be reconstructed as a function of $r$ other symbols. We use bundles of projective spaces over a line to construct locally recoverable codes with availability; that is, evaluation codes where each code word symbol can be reconstructed from several disjoint sets of other symbols. The simplest case, where the code's underlying variety is a plane, exhibits noteworthy properties: When $r = 1$, $2$, $3$, they are optimal; when $r \geq 4$, they are optimal with probability approaching $1$ as the alphabet size grows. Additionally, their information rate is close to the theoretical limit. In higher dimensions, our codes form a family of asymptotically good codes.</description>

      <title>On SYZ mirrors of Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) approach to mirror symmetry constructs a mirror space and a superpotential from the data of a Lagrangian torus fibration on a K\"ahler manifold with effective first Chern class. For K\"ahler manifolds whose first Chern class is not nef, the SYZ construction is further complicated by the presence of additional holomorphic discs with non-positive Maslov index.
  In this paper, we study SYZ mirror symmetry for two of the simplest non-Fano toric examples: the Hirzebruch surfaces F_3 and F_4. Our approach is to regularize moduli spaces of stable holomorphic discs using obstruction sections arising from infinitesimal deformations of the complex structure. For F_3, we determine the SYZ mirror associated to generic regularizing perturbations of the complex structure, and demonstrate that the mirror depends on the choice of perturbation. For F_4, we determine the SYZ mirror for a specific regularizing perturbation, where the mirror superpotential is an explicit infinite Laurent series. Finally, we relate this superpotential to those arising from other perturbations of F_4, as determined in the literature \cite{CPS24, BGL25}, via a scattering diagram.</description>

      <title>Counting rational points on smooth quartic and quintic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^3$ be a smooth projective surface of degree $d\ge 4$ defined over a number field $K$, and let $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)$ be the number of rational points of $X$ of height at most $B$ that do not lie on lines contained in $X$. Assuming a suitable hypothesis on the size of the rank of Abelian varieties, we show that $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_{K,d,\varepsilon} B^{4/3+\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$. This improves an unconditional bound from Salberger for $d=4$ and $d=5$. The proof, based on an argument of Heath-Brown, consists of cutting $X$ by projective planes and using a uniform version of Faltings's Theorem, due to Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, to bound the number of rational points on the plane sections of $X$. More generally, we prove that if $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ is a non-degenerate non-uniruled smooth projective surface defined over $K$, then $N_{X^{\prime}}(B)\ll_{K,n,d,\varepsilon}B^{\frac{n+1}{n}+\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Universal Hitchin moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study metric aspects of the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations as the complex structure $J$ varies over the Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}$ of a closed surface $\Sigma$. Our approach is gauge theoretical and builds on the theory of K\"ahler fibrations and the moment map interpretation of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. Our first main result establishes that, over the moduli space of cscK metrics, the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations carries a natural complex structure together with a family of pseudo-K\"ahler metrics forming a K\"ahler fibration with a K\"ahler Ehresmann connection.
  We then investigate a second universal moduli space, constructed from the space of flat $G$-connections over $\mathcal{T}$, which admits a nontrivial $J$-dependent K\"ahler fibration structure discovered by Hitchin. Using symplectic reduction, we build universal moduli spaces of solutions to the harmonicity equations depending on a coupling constant $\alpha$, obtaining natural complex and pseudo-K\"ahler structures and an explicit K\"ahler potential. The main novelty here is that this moduli space is defined by a system coupling the scalar curvature with a cubic term in the Higgs field. Finally, we propose a conjectural relationship between the two resulting families of moduli spaces in the weak-coupling limit $\alpha\to 0$, inspired by the twistor geometry of Hitchin's hyperk\"ahler moduli space.</description>
