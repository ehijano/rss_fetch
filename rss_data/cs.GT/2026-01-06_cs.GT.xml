      <title>Bad News for Couples: Tight Lower Bounds for Fair Division of Indivisible Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to couples, where each couple consists of two agents with distinct additive valuations. We show that there exist instances of allocating indivisible items to $n$ couples for which envy-freeness up to $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ items cannot be guaranteed. This closes the gap by matching the upper bound of Manurangsi and Suksompong, which applies to arbitrary instances with $n$ agents in total. This result is somewhat surprising, as that upper bound was conjectured not to be tight for instances consisting only of small groups.</description>

      <title>Carroll Mechanisms: Opportunities, Challenges, and Agenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of Carroll Mechanisms is to facilitate autonomous group sensemaking and reasoned decisionmaking by incentivizing participants to be transparent about their reasoning process, and to empower participants who are known to be capable of changing their minds. We envision Carroll Mechanisms to be built on top of a networked combinatorial LMSR foundation and thus to inherit the desriable properties of market scoring rules and automated market-makers. While we have made great strides during Fall 2025 in building out this foundation, several significant questions remain and several major new questions have arisen as a result of this work. The purpose of this document is to document the theoretical foundation, frame these questions clearly, and propose a research plan to address the questions.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Sample Complexity of Linear Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we settle the problem of learning optimal linear contracts from data in the offline setting, where agent types are drawn from an unknown distribution and the principal's goal is to design a contract that maximizes her expected utility. Specifically, our analysis shows that the simple Empirical Utility Maximization (EUM) algorithm yields an $\varepsilon$-approximation of the optimal linear contract with probability at least $1-\delta$, using just $O(\ln(1/\delta) / \varepsilon^2)$ samples. This result improves upon previously known bounds and matches a lower bound from Duetting et al. [2025] up to constant factors, thereby proving its optimality. Our analysis uses a chaining argument, where the key insight is to leverage a simple structural property of linear contracts: their expected reward is non-decreasing. This property, which holds even though the utility function itself is non-monotone and discontinuous, enables the construction of fine-grained nets required for the chaining argument, which in turn yields the optimal sample complexity. Furthermore, our proof establishes the stronger guarantee of uniform convergence: the empirical utility of every linear contract is a $\varepsilon$-approximation of its true expectation with probability at least $1-\delta$, using the same optimal $O(\ln(1/\delta) / \varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Metric Distortion with Preference Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In voting with ranked ballots, each agent submits a strict ranking of the form $a \succ b \succ c \succ d$ over the alternatives, and the voting rule decides on the winner based on these rankings. Although this ballot format has desirable characteristics, there is a question of whether it is expressive enough for the agents. Kahng, Latifian, and Shah address this issue by adding intensities to the rankings. They introduce the ranking with intensities ballot format, where agents can use both $\succ\!\!\succ$ and $\succ$ in their rankings to express intensive and normal preferences between consecutive alternatives in their rankings. While they focus on analyzing this ballot format in the utilitarian distortion framework, in this work, we look at the potential of using this ballot format from the metric distortion viewpoint. We design a class of voting rules coined Positional Scoring Matching rules, which can be used for different problems in the metric setting, and show that by solving a zero-sum game, we can find the optimal member of this class for our problem. This rule takes intensities into account and achieves a distortion lower than $3$. In addition, by proving a bound on the price of ignoring intensities, we show that we might lose a great deal in terms of distortion by not taking the intensities into account.</description>

      <title>LLM Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how delegating pricing to large language models (LLMs) can facilitate collusion in a duopoly when both sellers rely on the same pre-trained model. The LLM is characterized by (i) a propensity parameter capturing its internal bias toward high-price recommendations and (ii) an output-fidelity parameter measuring how tightly outputs track that bias; the propensity evolves through retraining. We show that configuring LLMs for robustness and reproducibility can induce collusion via a phase transition: there exists a critical output-fidelity threshold that pins down long-run behavior. Below it, competitive pricing is the unique long-run outcome. Above it, the system is bistable, with competitive and collusive pricing both locally stable and the realized outcome determined by the model's initial preference. The collusive regime resembles tacit collusion: prices are elevated on average, yet occasional low-price recommendations provide plausible deniability. With perfect fidelity, full collusion emerges from any interior initial condition. For finite training batches of size $b$, infrequent retraining (driven by computational costs) further amplifies collusion: conditional on starting in the collusive basin, the probability of collusion approaches one as $b$ grows, since larger batches dampen stochastic fluctuations that might otherwise tip the system toward competition. The indeterminacy region shrinks at rate $O(1/\sqrt{b})$.</description>

      <title>CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</description>

      <title>Solving Matrix Games with Even Fewer Matrix-Vector Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium of a two-player, bilinear, zero-sum game with a bounded payoff matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, when the players' strategies are constrained to lie in simple sets. We provide algorithms which solve this problem in $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ matrix-vector multiplies (matvecs) in two well-studied cases: $\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ games, where the players' strategies are both in the probability simplex, and $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ games, where the players' strategies are in the unit Euclidean ball and probability simplex respectively. These results improve upon the previous state-of-the-art complexities of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-8/9})$ for $\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ and of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-7/9})$ for $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ due to [KOS '25]. In particular, our result for $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$, which corresponds to hard-margin support vector machines (SVMs), matches the lower bound of [KS '25] up to polylogarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Selling Privacy in Blockchain Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study methods to enhance statistical privacy in blockchain transactions. We analyze economic mechanisms for privacy-aware transaction owners whose utility depends not only on the outcome of the mechanism but also negatively on the exposure of their economic preferences. First, we consider an order flow auction, where a user auctions off to specialized agents, called searchers, the right to execute her transaction while maintaining a degree of privacy. We examine how the degree of privacy affects the revenue of the auction and, broadly, the net utility of the privacy-aware user. In this new setting, we characterize the optimal auction, which is a sealed-bid auction. Subsequently, we analyze a variant of a Dutch auction in which the user gradually decreases the price and the degree of privacy until the transaction is sold. We compare the revenue of this auction to that of the optimal one as a function of the number of communication rounds. Then, we introduce a two-sided market - a privacy marketplace - with multiple users selling their transactions under their privacy preferences to multiple searchers. We propose a posted-price mechanism for the two-sided market that guarantees constant approximation of the optimal social welfare while maintaining incentive compatibility (from both sides of the market) and budget balance. This work builds on the emerging literature on privacy-preserving mechanism design, integrating statistical privacy guarantees into economic protocols to capture the impact of information leakage on blockchain users' utility.</description>

      <title>The Economics of Information Pollution in the Age of AI: General Equilibrium, Welfare, and Policy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shock to the economics of information production. By asymmetrically collapsing the marginal cost of generating low-quality, synthetic content while leaving high-quality production costly, AI systematically incentivizes information pollution. This paper develops a general equilibrium framework to analyze this challenge. We model the strategic interactions among a monopolistic platform, profit-maximizing producers, and utility-maximizing consumers in a three-stage game. The core of our model is a production technology with differential elasticities of substitution (\sigma_L &gt; 1 &gt; \sigma_H), which formalizes the insight that AI is a substitute for labor in low-quality production but a complement in high-quality creation. We prove the existence of a unique "Polluted Information Equilibrium" and demonstrate its inefficiency, which is driven by a threefold market failure: a production externality, a platform governance failure, and an information commons externality. Methodologically, we derive a theoretically-grounded Information Pollution Index (IPI) with endogenous welfare weights to measure ecosystem health. From a policy perspective, we show that a first-best outcome requires a portfolio of instruments targeting each failure. Finally, considering the challenges of deep uncertainty, we advocate for an adaptive governance framework where policy instruments are dynamically adjusted based on real-time IPI readings, offering a robust blueprint for regulating information markets in the age of AI.</description>
