      <title>The structure of inter-reaction times in reaction-diffusion processes and consequences for counting statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are quantified by counts of observable events, from the annihilation of quasiparticles in a lattice to predator-prey encounters on a landscape to spikes in a neural network. These events are triggered at random intervals when an underlying dynamical system occupies a set of reactive states in its phase space. We derive a general expression for the distribution of times between events in such counting processes assuming the underlying triggering dynamics is a stochastic process that converges to a stationary distribution. Our results contribute to resolving a long-standing dichotomy in the study of reaction-diffusion processes, showing the inter-reaction point process interpolates between a reaction- and a diffusion-limited regime. At low reaction rates, the inter-reaction process is Poisson with a rate depending on stationary properties of the event-triggering stochastic process. At high reaction rates, inter-reaction times are dominated by the hitting times to the reactive states. To further illustrate the power of this approach we apply our framework to obtain the counting statistics of two counting processes appearing in several biophysical scenarios. First, we study the common situation of estimating an animal's activity level by how often it crosses a detector, showing that the mean number of crossing events can decrease monotonically with the hitting rate, a seemingly 'paradoxical' result that could possibly lead to misinterpretation of experimental count data. Second, we derive the ensemble statistics for the detection of many particles, recovering and generalizing known results in the biophysics of chemosensation. Overall, we develop a unifying theoretical framework to quantify inter-event time distributions in reaction-diffusion systems that clarifies existing debates in the literature and provide examples of application to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Consensus decision making on a complete graph: complex behaviour from simple assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a model of consensus decision making [Hartnett A. T., et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2016, 116, 038701] following a statistical physics approach presented in [Sarkanych P., et al., Phys. Biol., 2023, 20, 045005]. Within this approach, the temperature serves as a measure of fluctuations, not considered before in the original model. Here, we discuss the model on a complete graph. The main goal of this paper is to show that an analytical description may lead to a very rich phase behaviour, which is usually not expected for a complete graph. However, the variety of individual agent (spin) features - their inhomogeneity and bias strength - taken into account by the model leads to rather non-trivial collective effects. We show that the latter may emerge in a form of continuous or abrupt phase transitions sometimes accompanied by re-entrant and order-parameter flipping behaviour. In turn, this may lead to appealing interpretations in terms of social decision making. We support analytical predictions by numerical simulation. Moreover, while analytical calculations are performed within an equilibrium statistical physics formalism, the numerical simulations add yet another dynamical feature - local non-linearity or conformity of the individual to the opinion of its surroundings. This feature appears to have a strong impact both on the way in which an equilibrium state is approached as well as on its characteristics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic modes and operator spreading in a long-range center-of-mass-conserving Brownian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a center-of-mass-conserving Brownian complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with long-range (power-law) interactions characterized by $1/r^\eta$. The kinetic constraint and long-range interactions conspire to yield rich hydrodynamics associated with the conserved charge, which we reveal by computing the Schwinger-Keldysh effective action. Our result shows that charge transport in this system can be subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive, with the dynamical exponent controlled by $\eta$. We further employ a doubled Hilbert space methodology to derive an effective action for the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), from which we obtain the phase diagram delineating regimes where the lightcone is linear or logarithmic. Our results provide a concrete example of a quantum many-body system with kinetic constraint and long-range interactions in which the emergent hydrodynamic modes and OTOC can be computed analytically.</description>

      <title>Four loop elasticity renormalization of low temperature flat polymerized membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the complete four loop perturbative renormalization of a low temperature statistical mechanics model of flat polymerized membranes. Within a non-local effective flexural theory based on transverse elastic fluctuations, we determine analytically, at the four existing fixed points, the anomalous elasticity critical exponent $\eta$ which controls all scaling behaviors in the theory. Results are obtained as apparently convergent series, enabling precise estimates without resummations. We independently confirm and complement the results of recent four-loop work [Pikelner 2022 EPL 138 17002] carried out in a different model. We also find good agreement with non-perturbative approaches and experiments on soft materials and graphene.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport in long-range interacting harmonic chains perturbed by long-range conservative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-equilibrium properties of a chain of $N$ oscillators with both long-ranged harmonic interactions and long-range conservative noise that exchange momenta of particle pairs. We derive exact expressions for the (deterministic) energy-current auto-correlation at equilibrium, based on the kinetic approximation of the normal mode dynamics. In all cases the decay is algebraic in the thermodynamic limit. We distinguish four distinct regimes of correlation decay depending on the exponents controlling the range of deterministic and stochastic interactions. Surprisingly, we find that long-range noise breaks down the long-range correlations characteristic of low dimensional models, suggesting a normal regime in which heat transport becomes diffusive. For finite systems, we do also derive exact expressions for the finite-size corrections to the algebraic decay of the correlation. In certain regimes, these corrections are considerably large, rendering hard the estimation of transport properties from numerical data for the finite chains. Our results are tested against numerical simulations, performed with an efficient algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous injection of energy at a localized region in space in a stationary gas creates a shock wave that propagates radially outwards. We study the hydrodynamics of this disturbance using event driven molecular dynamics of a hard sphere gas in three dimensions, the numerical solution of the Euler equation with a virial equation of state for the gas, and the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation. We show that the results from the Euler equation do not agree with the data from hard sphere simulations. Including dissipative terms through the Navier-Stokes equation results in reasonably good description of the data, when the coefficients of dissipation are chose parametrically.</description>

      <title>Mirages in the Energy Landscape of Soft Sphere Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy landscape is central to understanding low-temperature and athermal systems, like jammed soft spheres. The geometry of this high-dimensional energy surface is controlled by a plethora of minima and their associated basins of attraction that escape analytical treatment and are thus studied numerically. We show that the ODE solver with the best time-for-error for this problem, CVODE, is orders of magnitude faster than other steepest-descent solvers for such systems. Using this algorithm, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderate dimensions. Using various geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that results on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies, as basins are actually smooth structures with well-defined length scales. Thus, a vast number of past claims on energy landscapes need to be re-evaluated due to the use of inadequate numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Selection Principle for the Screening Parameters in the Mechanical Response of Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical response of amorphous solids to external strains is riddled with plastic events that create topological charges in the resulting displacement field. It was recently shown that the latter leads to screening phenomena that are accompanied by the breaking of both translational and Chiral symmetries. The screening effects are quantified by two screening parameters $\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_o$, which are inverse characteristic lengths that do not exist in classical elasticity. The screening parameters (and the associated lengths) are emergent, and it is important to understand how they are selected. This Letter explores the mechanism of selection of these characteristic lengths in two examples of strain protocols that allow analytic scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-State Predictive Information Bottleneck (GNN-SPIB) approach for learning molecular thermodynamics and kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations offer detailed insights into atomic motions but face timescale limitations. Enhanced sampling methods have addressed these challenges but even with machine learning, they often rely on pre-selected expert-based features. In this work, we present the Graph Neural Network-State Predictive Information Bottleneck (GNN-SPIB) framework, which combines graph neural networks and the State Predictive Information Bottleneck to automatically learn low-dimensional representations directly from atomic coordinates. Tested on three benchmark systems, our approach predicts essential structural, thermodynamic and kinetic information for slow processes, demonstrating robustness across diverse systems. The method shows promise for complex systems, enabling effective enhanced sampling without requiring pre-defined reaction coordinates or input features.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to fermionic lead, we show by characterizing its spectral form factor and level spacing distribution, that the system falls in the twilight zone between integrable and non-integrable regimes, which we call partially non-integrable. We further evidence that, despite being only partially non-integrable and thereby falling outside the remit of the standard eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, it nevertheless experiences IQS as well as OQS thermalization.</description>

      <title>Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasi-species concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called ``Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the ``Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalise this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to changes in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering that the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution are an order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple active models of matter recapitulate complex biological phenomena. Their out-of-equilibrium nature, however, often makes these models beyond the reach of first-principle descriptions. This limitation is particularly perplexing when attempting to distinguish between different glass-forming mechanisms. We here consider a minimal active system in various spatial dimensions to identify the underlying processes at play. Activity is found to markedly impact cage escape processes and critical fluctuations, thus offering a distinct perspective on the role of activity sluggish dynamics.</description>

      <title>LifeGPT: Topology-Agnostic Generative Pretrained Transformer Model for Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model (LLM) framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of an external trap, whereby a system relaxes to the minimum of the trap and is reset in a finite time. In this work, we set up and analyse the thermodynamics of such a protocol. We present a general framework, even valid for non-Poissonian resetting, that captures the thermodynamic work required to maintain a resetting process up to a given observation time, and exactly calculate the moment generating function of this work. Our framework is valid for a wide range of systems, the only assumption being relaxation to equilibrium in the resetting trap. Examples and extensions are considered. In the case of Brownian motion, we investigate optimal resetting schemes that minimise work and its fluctuations, the mean work for arbitrary switching protocols and comparisons to previously studied resetting schemes. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations of Spectrum Form Factor and Krylov Complexity at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of quantum chaos diagnostics, considerable attention has been attributed to the Krylov complexity and spectrum form factor (SFF) for systems at infinite temperature. These investigations have unveiled universal properties of quantum chaotic systems. By extending the analysis to include the finite temperature effects on the Krylov complexity and SFF, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, which are associated with the Wightman inner product, display consistency with the universal hypothesis presented in PRX 9, 041017 (2019). This result contrasts with the behavior of Lanczos coefficients associated with the standard inner product. Our results indicate that the slope $\alpha$ of the $b_n$ is bounded by $\pi k_BT$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature. We also investigate the SFF, which characterizes the two-point correlation of the spectrum and encapsulates an indicator of ergodicity denoted by $g$ in chaotic systems. Our analysis demonstrates that as the temperature decreases, the value of $g$ decreases as well. Considering that $\alpha$ also represents the operator growth rate, we establish a quantitative relationship between ergodicity indicator and Lanczos coefficients slope. To support our findings, we provide evidence using the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and a random spin model. Our work deepens the understanding of the finite temperature effects on Krylov complexity, SFF, and the connection between ergodicity and operator growth.</description>

      <title>Active Magnetic Matter: Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter encompasses many-particle systems with self-propelling units, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we show how self-propelling domain walls can be realised in a solid-state system when a ferrimagnet is weakly driven out of thermal equilibrium by an oscillating field. This activates the Goldstone mode, inducing a rotation of the antiferromagnetic xy-order in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. Two opposite directions of rotation meet at a domain wall in the ferromagnetic component, resulting in `dynamical frustration', with three main consequences. (i) Domain walls move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Their speed is proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. (ii) In one dimension (1D), after a quench into the ferrimagnetic phase, this motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. (iii) The dynamical frustration makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven 1D system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

      <title>The Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python (pip).</description>

      <title>Optimal light cone for macroscopic particle transport in long-range systems: A quantum speed limit approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ultimate rate at which information propagates is a pivotal issue in nonequilibrium physics. Nevertheless, the task of elucidating the propagation speed inherent in quantum bosonic systems presents challenges due to the unbounded nature of their interactions. In this study, we tackle the problem of macroscopic particle transport in a long-range generalization of the lattice Bose-Hubbard model through the lens of the quantum speed limit. By developing a unified approach based on optimal transport theory, we rigorously prove that the minimum time required for macroscopic particle transport is always bounded by the distance between the source and target regions, while retaining its significance even in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the probability of observing a specific number of bosons inside the target region, thereby providing additional insights into the dynamics of particle transport. Our results hold true for arbitrary initial states under both long-range hopping and long-range interactions, thus resolving an open problem of particle transport in generic bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and mixing quantum channels: From two-qubit to many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of classical ergodic theory has had a significant impact in the areas of mathematics, physics, and, in general, applied sciences. The quantum ergodic theory of Hamiltonian dynamics has its motivations to understand thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Quantum channel, a completely positive trace-preserving map, represents a most general representation of quantum dynamics and is an essential aspect of quantum information theory and quantum computation. In this work, we study the ergodic theory of quantum channels by characterizing different levels of ergodic hierarchy from integrable to mixing. The quantum channels on single systems are constructed from the unitary operators acting on bipartite states and tracing out the environment. The interaction strength of these unitary operators measured in terms of operator entanglement provides sufficient conditions for the channel to be mixing. By using block diagonal unitary operators, we construct a set of non-ergodic channels. By using canonical form of two-qubit unitary operator, we analytically construct the channels on single qubit ranging from integrable to mixing. Moreover, we also study interacting many-body quantum systems that include the famous Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that they display mixing within the framework of the quantum channel.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for non-local spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Associative Watermarking Using Statistical Neurodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically evaluated the performance of our proposed associative watermarking method in which the watermark is not embedded directly into the image. We previously proposed a watermarking method that extends the zero-watermarking model by applying associative memory models. In this model, the hetero-associative memory model is introduced to the mapping process between image features and watermarks, and the auto-associative memory model is applied to correct watermark errors. We herein show that the associative watermarking model outperforms the zero-watermarking model through computer simulations using actual images. In this paper, we describe how we derive the macroscopic state equation for the associative watermarking model using the Okada theory. The theoretical results obtained by the fourth-order theory were in good agreement with those obtained by computer simulations. Furthermore, the performance of the associative watermarking model was evaluated using the bit error rate of the watermark, both theoretically and using computer simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commonly, the notion of "quantum chaos'' refers to the fast scrambling of information throughout complex quantum systems undergoing unitary evolution. Motivated by the Krylov complexity and the operator growth hypothesis, we demonstrate that the entropy of the population distribution for an operator in time is a useful way to capture the complexity of the internal information dynamics of a system when subject to an environment and is, in principle, agnostic to the specific choice of operator basis. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, examining the dynamics of the system in both its Krylov basis and the basis of operator strings. We prove that the former basis minimises spread complexity while the latter is an eigenbasis for high dissipation. In both cases, we probe the long-time dynamics of the model and the phenomenological effects of decoherence on the complexity of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entropic signature of resonant thermal transport: Ordered form of heat conduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The anharmonic phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing (quasi-)long-range order in a two-dimensional driven crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that 2D systems can exhibit crystalline phases with long-range translational order showcasing a striking violation of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner (HMW) theorem which is valid at equilibrium. This is made possible by athermal driving mechanisms that inject energy into the system without exciting long wavelength modes of the density field, thereby inducing hyperuniformity. However, as thermal fluctuations are superimposed on the non-equilibrium driving, long-range translational order is inevitably lost. Here, we discuss the possibility of exploiting non-equilibrium effects to suppress arbitrarily large density fluctuations even when a global thermal bath is coupled to the system. We introduce a model of a harmonic crystal driven both by a global thermal bath and by a momentum conserving noise, where the typical observables related to density fluctuations and long-range translational order can be analytically derived and put in relation. This model allows us to rationalize the violation of the HMW theorem observed in previous studies through the prediction of large-wavelength phonons which thermalize at a vanishing effective temperature when the global bath is switched off. The conceptual framework introduced through this theory is then applied to numerical simulations of a hard-disk solid in contact with a thermal bath and driven out-of-equilibrium by active collisions. Our numerical analysis demonstrates how varying driving and dissipative parameters can lead to an arbitrary enhancement of the quasi-long-range order in the system regardless of the applied global noise amplitude. Finally, we outline a possible experimental procedure to apply our results to a realistic granular system.</description>

      <title>Oscillating-mode gap: an indicator of phase transition in open quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It presents a significant challenge to elucidate the relationship between the phases of open quantum many-body systems and the spectral structure of their governing Liouvillian, which determines how the density matrix evolves. Previous studies have focused on the Liouvillian gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying mode, as a key indicator of dissipative phase transition, noting its closure in symmetry-broken phases and opening in disordered phases. In this work, we propose an additional spectral gap, termed the oscillating-mode gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying oscillating mode. Through the analysis of a prototype dissipative boson system, we demonstrate the necessity of both the Liouvillian gap and the oscillating-mode gap for the comprehensive characterization of the system's phases and the transitions between them.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the pattern effect in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system through linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy surplus resulting from radiative forcing causes warming of the Earth system. This initial warming drives a myriad of changes including in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), leading to different radiative feedbacks. The relationship between the radiative feedbacks and the pattern of SST changes is referred to as the "pattern effect". The current approach to study the pattern effect relies on diagnosing the response of atmosphere-only models to perturbations in the SST boundary condition. Here, we argue that the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), together with coarse-graining procedures, is a computationally cheap and theoretically grounded alternative to model experiments. We introduce a protocol to study the pattern effect and present its application in a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. By focusing on the coupled dynamics, we unveil the role of the slow ocean component in setting the pattern effect. We present a new "sensitivity map", representing a first, qualitative prediction of the response of the average top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux to perturbations in the SST field. We find negative sensitivity throughout the tropics, in contrast to the current understanding of a positive-negative dipole of sensitivity in the tropical Pacific. Considering only the shortest time scales, the response is dominated by the fast atmospheric variability and we recover results in qualitative agreement with the literature. Therefore, the difference between our results and previous studies, largely comes from including the atmosphere-ocean coupling. The framework offers a conceptually novel perspective on the pattern effect: feedbacks in the coupled system are encoded in a temporally and spatially dependent response operator, rather than time-independent maps as for previous studies.</description>
