      <title>Thermal circuit model for silicon quantum-dot array structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature rise of qubits due to heating is a critical issue in large-scale quantum computers based on quantum-dot (QD) arrays. This leads to shorter coherence times, induced readout errors, and increased charge noise. Here, we propose a simple thermal circuit model to describe the heating effect on silicon QD array structures. Noting that the QD array is a periodic structure, we represent it as a thermal distributed-element circuit, forming a thermal transmission line. We validate this model by measuring the electron temperature in a QD array device using Coulomb blockade thermometry, finding that the model effectively reproduces experimental results. This simple and scalable model can be used to develop the thermal design of large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</description>

      <title>Stability of chiral magnon condensate in antiferromagnetic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators has been a field of much interest, while condensation in anti-ferromagnetic systems are yet to be explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: an easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type DMI interaction supports two condensate populations at finite wavevectors. The condensation state is stable only when the distribution of magnons between the two populations is symmetric. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without DMI interaction we predict that the magnons condensate will not be stabilized. The results indicate that the lack of stability is a general feature of single-component quasiparticle condensates.</description>

      <title>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</description>

      <title>Semiconducting ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon for high-efficiency spin-Seebeck diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semiconductiong ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon (${\alpha'}$-BNR) due to its incredible properties such as high stability and great mobility of carriers demostrates high-efficiency in thermoelectric devices. These properties enable us to produce the spin current by a temperature gradient with lower energy consumption technology. In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects are studied in a zigzag ${\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads magnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations are performed for a ${\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the tight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient so that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential spin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of thermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the effect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\alpha'}$-BNR. A significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in the magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that the ${\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g., graphene and silicene. This is attributed to the semiconducting nature and high asymmetry between electrons and holes in the ${\alpha'}$-BNR. The exceptional features of ${\alpha'}$-BNR makes it a very suitable choice for using in thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent-induced harmonics in nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</description>

      <title>Observation of liquid-solid transition of nanoconfined water at ambient temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in biology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties compared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the origin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural information on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the nanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical spectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the structure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS) based on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics and structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a two-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride (hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure the confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2 nm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the hydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on the diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the measured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition observed in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our results showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of nanoconfined water in future applications.</description>

      <title>Exponential suppression of the topological gap in self-consistent intrinsic Majorana nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave phase is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeeman field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Dicke-Ising Model via Digital-Analog Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr\"odinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</description>

Abstract: Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</description>

      <title>Identifying topological excitonic insulators via bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitonic insulator remains elusive and there has been a lack of reliable identification methods. In this work, we demonstrate the promise of topological excitonic insulators for identification due to their unique bulk-edge correspondence, as illustrated by the LiFe$X$ ($X$ = S, Se, and Te) family. First-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations reveal excitonic instabilities in these spin-orbit coupling quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Effective Hamiltonian analyses indicate that spontaneous exciton condensation does not disrupt the gapless edge state but reconstructs the bulk-gap to be almost independent of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This change in the bulk-edge correspondence can be experimentally inspected by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy or electron compressibility measurements, providing observational evidence for the identification of topological excitonic insulators. Moreover, exciton condensation raises the critical temperature of the topological nontrivial phase above room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of laser science and technology have stimulated the study of condensed matter physics, especially, dynamical or non-equilibrium nature in solids. The laser technique in terahertz (THz) regime, whose photon energy is comparable to those of typical collective modes in solids such as magnetic excitations, phonons, etc., has remarkably proceeded in the last decade. Theoretical tools for non-equilibrium states have also progressed. Thanks to these backgrounds, magneto-optics, especially, the study of controlling magnetism with laser, now enters a new stage. For such controls, Floquet engineering is a key concept, which means the method of controlling static properties of targets with high-frequency external fields like laser. I review the theoretical foundation of Floquet engineering and its application to magnetic insulators. Basic magnetic quantities such as magnetization, spin chirality, and spin current are shown to be controlled with intense THz laser or wave.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</description>

      <title>Taming Landau level mixing in fractional quantum Hall states with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Impurity-temperature phase diagram with phase crystals and competing time-reversal symmetry breaking states in nodal $d$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase crystals are a class of non-uniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. These phase gradients non-locally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits. Finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents.</description>

Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing the dimensionless figure of merit zT is central to developing better thermoelectric materials and advancing thermoelectric generation technology. However, the intrinsic interdependence between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity presents a significant challenge. Over time, various strategies have emerged, but the literature remains difficult to navigate due to its widespread distribution across numerous sources. This short review highlights the key approaches to improving zT, offering a clear and concise guide to help researchers understand the major ideas and breakthroughs in the field.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden States in Quantum Dot Array Dynamics: Quantum Polyspectra Versus Waiting Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in 2D layouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</description>

      <title>Single-Photon Advantage in Quantum Cryptography Beyond QKD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</description>

Abstract: We determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two ThermoElectric Converters (TEC) using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. Each TEC is modeled by a non-equilibrium conductance/resistance matrix describing the current-force characteristics of the TEC in stationary non-equilibrium. For TECs in series, we investigate the continuity of the potentials (and their derivatives) at their interfaces when thermoelectric coefficients are equal or not. We also study the current-dependent boundary conditions (for each sub-device) that significantly modify the conversion process. For TECs in parallel, we show that our result is compatible with the previously mentioned internal current loops even in open circuit boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dissipative coupling in nanoscale multimode superfluid acoustics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Back-action refers to a response that retro-acts on a system to tailor its properties with respect to an external stimulus. This effect is at the heart of many electronic devices such as amplifiers, oscillators, and sensors. Here, we demonstrate that back-action can be exploited to achieve non-reciprocal transport in superconducting circuits. In our devices, dissipationless current flows in one direction whereas dissipative transport occurs in the opposite direction. Supercurrent diodes presented so far rely on magnetic elements or vortices to mediate charge transport or external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry. Back-action solely turns a conventional reciprocal superconducting weak link with no asymmetry between the current bias directions into a rectifier, where the critical current amplitude depends on the bias sign. The self-interaction of the supercurrent stems from the gate tunability of the critical current in metallic and semiconducting systems, which promotes nearly ideal magnetic field-free rectification with selectable polarity.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic hybrid magnonic circuits based on spalled YIG thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. Our approach uses the Iwasawa decomposition to parametrise the transfer matrix uniquely in terms of three real numbers. This allows us to obtain simple conditions for the existence of topologically protected edge states and to provide a visual illustration of all possible solutions. In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</description>

      <title>Orbital Edelstein effect from the gradient of a scalar potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity of Heavily-Doped Single-Layer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of superconductivity (SC) in graphene appears to be established in both twisted and non-twisted multilayers. However, whether their building block, single-layer graphene (SLG), can also host SC remains an open question. Earlier theoretical works predicted that SLG could become a chiral d-wave superconductor driven by electronic interactions when doped to its van Hove singularity, but questions such as whether the d-wave SC survives the strong band renormalizations seen in experiments, its robustness against the source of doping, or if it will occur at any reasonable critical temperature (Tc) have remained difficult to answer, in part due to uncertainties in model parameters. In this study, we adopt a random-phase approximation framework based on a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism to investigate SC in heavily-doped SLG. We predict that robust d+id topological SC could arise in SLG doped by Tb, with a Tc up to 600 mK. We also investigate the possibility of realizing d-wave SC by employing other dopants, such as Li or Cs. The structural models have been derived from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on Tb-doped graphene and first-principles calculations for Cs and Li doping. We find that dopants that change the lattice symmetry of SLG are detrimental to the d-wave state. The stability of the d-wave SC predicted here in Tb-doped SLG could provide a valuable insight for guiding future experimental efforts aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in monolayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schr\"odinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</description>

Abstract: Gatemons are superconducting qubits resembling transmons, with a gate-tunable semiconducting weak link as the Josephson element. Here, we report a gatemon device featuring an aluminum microwave circuit on a Ge/SiGe heterostructure embedding a Ge quantum well. Owing to the superconducting proximity effect, the high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas confined in this well provides a gate-tunable superconducting weak link between two Al contacts. We perform Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference measurements, demonstrate the gate-voltage dependence of the qubit frequency, and measure the qubit anharmonicity. We find relaxation times T$_{1}$ up to 119 ns, and Ramsey coherence times T$^{*}_{2}$ up to 70 ns, and a qubit frequency gate-tunable over 3.5 GHz. The reported proof-of-concept reproduces the results of a very recent work [Sagi et al., Nat. Commun. 15, 6400 (2024)] using similar Ge/SiGe heterostructures thereby validating a novel platform for the development of gatemons and parity-protected cos(2$\phi$) qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>

      <title>The $N_2V$ color center: a ubiquitous visible and near-infrared-II quantum emitter in nitrogen-doped diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoluminescent defects in diamond, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center, are at the forefront of emerging optical quantum technologies. Most emit in the visible and near-infrared spectral region below 1000 nm (NIR-I), limiting their applications in photonics, fiber communications, and biology. Here, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy-nitrogen ($N_2V$) center, which emits in the visible and near-infrared-II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is ubiquitous in as-synthesized and processed nitrogen-doped diamond from bulk samples to nanoparticles. We demonstrate that $N_2V$ is also present in commercially available state-of-the-art NV diamond sensing chips made via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamonds, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of both $N_2V$ charge states, $N_2V^0$ in the visible and $N_2V^-$ in the NIR-II, increases with increasing substitutional nitrogen concentration. We determine the PL lifetime of $N_2V^-$ to be 0.3 ns and compare a quantum optical and density functional theory model of the $N_2V^-$ with experimental PL spectra. Finally, we show that detonation nanodiamonds (DND) show stable PL in the NIR-II, which we attribute to the $N_2V$ color center, and use this NIR-II PL to image DNDs inside skin cells. Our results will contribute to the scientific and technological exploration and development of the $N_2V$ color center and inspire more research into its effect on other color centers in diamond.</description>

Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Vertically Graded Fe-Ni Alloys with Low Damping and a Sizeable Spin-Orbit Torque</title>

Abstract: Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Identifying Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in a $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These BFSs exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of $d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the generation of the BFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized version of our continuum model.</description>

      <title>Goos-H\"anchen effect singularities in transdimensional plasmonic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and classify topologically protected singularities for the reflection coefficient of transdimensional plasmonic systems. Originating from nonlocal electromagnetic response due to vertical electron confinement in the system, such singularities lead to lateral (angular) Goos-H\"anchen shifts on the millimeter (milliradian) scale in the visible range, greatly exceeding those reported previously for artificially designed metasurfaces, offering new opportunities for quantum material development.</description>
