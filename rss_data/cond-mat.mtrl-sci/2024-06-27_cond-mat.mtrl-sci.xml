      <title>Quantification of Cyclic Topology in Polymer Networks Using 3D Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer networks invariably possess topological inhomogeneities in the form of loops and dangling ends. The macroscopic properties of such materials are directly dependent on the local cyclic topology around nodes and chains. Here, a new formalism to model polymer network topology is presented based on the concept of 3D nets that enables computation of these local cyclic topologies. A cycle counting algorithm is developed which characterizes the relevant local topological cycles around every node, enabling comparison of networks to ideal nets based on local cycle distributions. Comparison of networks formed by different simulation algorithms, using a topology-based distance metric, reveals that polymer networks possess a fundamental cycle size which depends on the topological proximity of crosslinkers during bond formation. This parameter identifies distinct topological classes of networks and provides an effective method to simulate a wide array of networks starting from suitable 3D nets. This approach can be readily generalized beyond polymer networks, enabling quantification of the cyclic topology and facilitating study of topology-property correlations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Data Bias on Machine Learning for Crystal Compound Synthesizability Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are susceptible to being misled by biases in training data that emphasize incidental correlations over the intended learning task. In this study, we demonstrate the impact of data bias on the performance of a machine learning model designed to predict the synthesizability likelihood of crystal compounds. The model performs a binary classification on labeled crystal samples. Despite using the same architecture for the machine learning model, we showcase how the model's learning and prediction behavior differs once trained on distinct data. We use two data sets for illustration: a mixed-source data set that integrates experimental and computational crystal samples and a single-source data set consisting of data exclusively from one computational database. We present simple procedures to detect data bias and to evaluate its effect on the model's performance and generalization. This study reveals how inconsistent, unbalanced data can propagate bias, undermining real-world applicability even for advanced machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Connected Network Model for the Mechanical Loss of Amorphous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical loss in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to thermally activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with a mechanical wave. Using atomistic modeling of amorphous silicon, we observe instead that the inherent structures that constitute the TLS form a sparsely connected network with thermodynamic pathways between states. An analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network is derived from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We show that the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct temperature and frequency profiles when compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials for applications in gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Effects of model size in density-functional-theory study of alloys: A case study of CsPbBr$_2$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary challenge of density-functional-theory exploration of alloy systems concerns the size of computational model. Small alloy models can hardly exhibit the chemical disorder properly, while large models induce difficulty in sampling the alignments within the massive material space. We study this problem with the {\gamma} phase of the mixed halide inorganic perovskite alloy CsPbBr$_2$Cl. The distribution of alloy formation energy becomes narrower when the size of the model system increases along $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}\times2$, $2\times2\times2$, and $2\sqrt{2}\times2\sqrt{2}\times2$ models. This is primarily because the distribution of Br distribution parameters, which plays a leading role in determining the formation energy range, is more narrow for larger models. As a result, larger entropy stability effect can be observed with larger models especially at high temperatures, for which the approximation using mixing entropy based on the ideal solution model becomes better.</description>

      <title>Protocols for Obtaining Reliable PDFs from Laboratory x-ray Sources Using PDFgetX3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explored data acquisition protocols and improved data reduction protocols using PDFgetX3 to obtain reliable data for atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis from a laboratory-based Mo x-ray source. A variable counting scheme is described that preferentially counts in the high-angle region of the diffraction pattern. The effects on the resulting PDF are studied by varying the overall count time, the use of Soller slits, and limiting the out-of-plane divergence of the incident beam. The protocols are tested using an amorphous silica and a quartz sample. We also present a modification to the current PDFgetX3 data corrections to take care of sample absorption, which was previously neglected in the use of that program for high-energy synchrotron x-ray data. We show that, despite limitations in the Q-range and flux of laboratory instruments, reasonable data for PDF model fits may be obtained using the best protocols in a few hours of counting.</description>

      <title>Resolving the local distortions of Ising-like moments in magnetoelectric Ho-doped langasite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of Ho-doped langasites (La:Ho)$_3$Ga$_5$SiO$_{14}$ are dominated by the Ising-like magnetic moments of the Ho$^{3+}$ ions. In their saturated regime, the induced magnetic state breaks both time and space inversion symmetries, leading to a novel linear magnetoelectric effect. However, due to distortions induced by a shared Ga/Si occupancy of the 2d sites, resolving the microscopic nature of the magnetic configuration remains a difficult task. Here we combine polarized neutron diffraction and angular dependent magnetization experiments to determine the local distortions of the Ho$^{3+}$ magnetic moments in doped langasites (La$_{1-x}$Ho$_x$)$_3$Ga$_5$SiO$_{14}$ with $x \approx 0.015$ and $x \approx 0.045$. We propose a model for a field-induced magnetic configuration with arbitrary orientations of the local Ising axis of Ho$^{3+}$ in distorted positions. The operations of broken local $C_2$ symmetry and rotations around the trigonal $C_3$ axis connect different sites, restoring the global P321 symmetry of the crystal and simplifying the description of the magnetic properties. The superposition of two distorted Ho$^{3+}$ positions connected by $C_2$ symmetry determines the local magnetic susceptibility tensor, which no longer appears Ising-like at low fields.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measurement of cooperative binding in partially dissociated water dimers at the hematite R-cut surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-solid interfaces pervade the natural environment and modern technology. On some surfaces, water-water interactions induce the formation of partially dissociated interfacial layers; understanding why is important to model processes in catalysis or mineralogy. The complexity of the partially dissociated structures often make it difficult to probe them in a quantitative manner. Here, we utilize normal incidence x-ray standing waves (NIXSW) to study the structure of partially dissociated water dimers (H2O-OH) at the Fe2O3(012) surface (also called (1-102) or R-cut surface); a system simple enough to be tractable, yet complex enough to capture the essential physics. We find the H2O and terminal OH groups to be the same height above the surface within experimental error (1.45 +/- 0.04 Angstrom and 1.47 +/- 0.02 Angstrom, respectively), in line with DFT-based calculations that predict comparable Fe-O bond lengths for both water and OH species. This result is understood in the context of cooperative binding, where the formation of the H-bond between adsorbed H2O and OH induces the H2O to bind more strongly, and OH to bind more weakly compared to when these species are isolated on the surface. The surface OH formed by the liberated proton is found to be in plane with a bulk truncated (012) surface (-0.01 +/- 0.02 Angstrom). DFT calculations based on various functionals correctly model the cooperative effect, but overestimate the water-surface interaction.</description>

      <title>Single atom chemical identification of TMD defects in ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of defects in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can lead to dramatic local changes in their properties which are of interest for a range of technologies including quantum security devices, hydrogen production, and energy storage. It is therefore essential to be able to study these materials in their native environments, including ambient conditions. Here we report single atom resolution imaging of atomic defects in MoS2, WSe2 and WS2 monolayers carried out in ambient conditions using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). By comparing measurements from a range of TMDs we use C-AFM to chemically identify the most likely atomic species for the defects observed and quantify their prevalence on each material, identifying oxygen chalcogen substitutions and transition metal substitutions as the most likely, and most common, defect types. Moreover, we demonstrate that C-AFM operated in ambient environments can resolve subtle changes in electronic structure with atomic resolution, which we apply to WSe2 monolayers doped using a nitrogen plasma, demonstrating the capability of C-AFM to resolve electronic, and chemical-specific, details at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>ViPErLEED package II: Spot tracking, extraction and processing of I(V) curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the ViPErLEED project (Vienna package for Erlangen LEED, low-energy electron diffraction), computer programs have been developed for facile and user-friendly data extraction from movies of LEED images. The programs make use of some concepts from astronomical image processing and analysis. As a first step, flat-field and dark-frame corrections reduce the effects of inhomogeneities of the camera and screen. In a second step, for identifying all diffraction maxima ("spots"), it is sufficient to manually mark and label a single spot or very few spots. Then the program can automatically identify all other spots and determine the distortions of the image. This forms the basis for automatic spot tracking (following the "beams" as they move across the LEED screen) and intensity measurement. Even for complex structures with hundreds to a few thousand diffraction beams, this step takes less than a minute. The package also includes a program for further processing of these I(V) curves (averaging of equivalent beams, manual and/or automatic selection, smoothing) as well as several utilities. The software is implemented as a set of plugins for the public-domain image processing program ImageJ and provided as an open-source package.</description>

      <title>Structure-Driven Prediction of Magnetic Order in Uranium Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of machine learning technologies has revolutionized the search and optimization of material properties. These algorithms often rely on theoretical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT), for data inputs and validation, which are not always effective for uranium-based materials due to their strong electron correlations. This study presents a computationally inexpensive machine learning approach, specifically a random forest classifier, to predict the magnetic ground states of uranium compounds using only structural inputs. Our model, trained on a curated dataset of experimentally-verified magnetic orders, achieves a mean accuracy of 60.2%, significantly outperforming random chance. By excluding computationally intensive DFT calculations, our method offers a faster and reliable alternative for discovering new materials with desirable magnetic properties, addressing the challenges posed by strong correlations in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>On the increase of the melting temperature of water confined in one-dimensional nano-cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water confined in nanoscale cavities plays a crucial role in everyday phenomena in geology and biology, as well as technological applications at the water-energy nexus. However, even understanding the basic properties of nano-confined water is extremely challenging for theory, simulations, and experiments. In particular, determining the melting temperature of quasi-one-dimensional ice polymorphs confined in carbon nanotubes has proven to be an exceptionally difficult task, with previous experimental and classical simulations approaches report values ranging from $\sim 180 \text{ K}$ up to $\sim 450 \text{ K}$ at ambient pressure. In this work, we use a machine learning potential that delivers first principles accuracy to study the phase diagram of water for confinement diameters $ 9.5 &lt; d &lt; 12.5 \text{ \AA}$. We find that several distinct ice polymorphs melt in a surprisingly narrow range between $\sim 280 \text{ K}$ and $\sim 310 \text{ K}$, with a melting mechanism that depends on the nanotube diameter. These results shed new light on the melting of ice in one-dimension and have implications for the operating conditions of carbon-based filtration and desalination devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate ab initio simulation of molecules and periodic solids with diagrammatic perturbation theory is an important task in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. In this article, we present the WeakCoupling module of the open-source software package Green, which implements fully self-consistent diagrammatic weak coupling simulations, capable of dealing with real materials in the finite-temperature formalism. The code is licensed under the permissive MIT license. We provide self-consistent GW (scGW) and self-consistent second-order Green's function perturbation theory (GF2) solvers, analysis tools, and post-processing methods. This paper summarizes the theoretical methods implemented and provides background, tutorials and practical instructions for running simulations.</description>

      <title>Digging its own Site: Linear Coordination Stabilizes a Pt1/Fe2O3 Single-Atom Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the local coordination of the active site is a pre-requisite for the reliable modeling of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Obtaining such information is difficult on powder-based systems, so much emphasis is placed on density functional theory-based computations based on idealized low-index surfaces of the support. In this work, we investigate how Pt atoms bind to the (1-102) facet of Fe2O3, a common support material in SAC. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and an extensive computational evolutionary search, we find that Pt atoms significantly reconfigure the support lattice to facilitate a pseudo-linear coordination to surface oxygen atoms. Despite breaking three surface Fe-O bonds, this geometry is favored by 0.84 eV over the best configuration involving an unperturbed support. We suggest that the linear O-Pt-O configuration is common in reactive Pt-based SAC systems because it balances thermal stability with the ability to adsorb reactants from the gas phase, and that extensive structural searches are likely necessary to determine realistic active site geometry in single-atom catalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon detectors featuring single-photon sensitivity play a crucial role in various scientific domains, including high-energy physics, astronomy, and quantum optics. Fast response time, high quantum efficiency, and minimal dark counts are the characteristics that render them ideal candidates for detecting individual photons with exceptional signal-to-noise ratios, at frequencies in the the range of hundreds of MHz. Here, we report on our first design and operational results on a Hybrid Photon Detector (HPD) that combines the high quantum efficiency of a Gallium Nitride (GaN) photocathode and the low noise characteristics of a Si-based Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD). This hybrid detection scheme has the potential to reach single-photon detection sensitivity with high quantum efficiency, low noise levels and capable of operating at hundreds of MHz repetition rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric in Step Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions has gained considerable interest with the discovery of moir\'e materials that exhibit bands flattened by quantum interference. The quantum metric, the symmetric part of the quantum geometric tensor, influences several observables, such as the dielectric constant, superfluid stiffness and optical spectral weight. However, a direct measurement of the metric itself has remained elusive so far. In linear response functions such as the conductivity, the matrix elements of the metric typically appear convoluted with energy prefactors, preventing finding an observable that is directly proportional to the total quantum metric. The only observable that may extract it is the integrated optical spectral weight weighted by the inverse frequency, a generalized sum rule known as the Souza-Wilkens-Martin (SWM) sum rule. However, the sum rule comes with experimental challenges, such as requiring a large spectrum of frequency resolution. In this work, we propose relaxation from constrained equilibrium as a method to directly measure the symmetric part of the time-dependent quantum geometric tensor (tQGT), which at $t=0$ is the quantum metric. Additionally, we comment on other geometric properties of insulators that are absent in the frequency expansions of conductivity in insulators but can, in principle, be revealed in step response.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper [T. Shang et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 224504 (2023)], the authors study the physical properties of TaReSi compounds having Ima2 structure. This noncentrosymmetric structure is proposed to be the source of topological properties for mentioned compound. However, for a correct description of topological features, it is important to recognize the correct structure of the compound at low temperature. In this Comment, we show that Ima2 cannot be realized by TaReSi and is unstable at low temperature. The Ima2 structure contains the soft modes at S (1/2,0,0) point, which leads to the stable structure with Cm symmetry. Notably, the stable Cm system also has a noncentrosymmetric structure, which can be the actual source of topological properties.</description>

Abstract: Plasmon polaritons are formed by coupling light with delocalized electrons. The half-light and half-matter nature of plasmon polaritons endows them with unparalleled tunability via a range of parameters, such as dielectric environments and carrier density. Therefore, plasmon polaritons are expected to be tuned when in proximity to polar materials since the carrier density is tuned by an electrostatic potential; conversely, the plasmon polariton response might enable the sensing of polarization. Here, we use infrared nano-imaging and nano-photocurrent measurements to investigate heterostructures composed of graphene and twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-BN), with alternating polarization in a triangular network of moir\'e stacking domains. We observe that the carrier density and the corresponding plasmonic response of graphene are modulated by polar domains in t-BN. In addition, we demonstrate that the nanometer-wide domain walls of graphene moir\'es superlattices, created by the polar domains of t-BN, provide momenta to assist the plasmonic excitations. Furthermore, our studies establish that the plasmon of graphene could function as a delicate sensor for polarization textures. The evolution of polarization textures in t-BN under uniform electric fields is tomographically examined via plasmonic imaging. Strikingly, no noticeable polarization switching is observed under applied electric fields up to 0.23 V/nm, at variance with transport reports. Our nano-images unambiguously reveal that t-BN with triangular domains acts like a ferrielectric, rather than ferroelectric claimed by many previous studies.</description>

Abstract: The element boron has long been central to two-dimensional superconducting materials, and numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of superconductivity in various boron-based structures. Recent work introduced a new variant: Bilayer Kagome borophene, characterized by its bilayer Kagome lattice with van Hove singularity. Using first-principles calculations, our research investigates the unique electronic structure and superconducting properties of Bilayer Kagome borophene (BK-borophene) through first-principles calculations. BK-borophene is identified as a single-gap superconductor with an initial superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 11.0 K. By strategically doping the material to align its Fermi level with the Van Hove singularity, Tc is significantly enhanced to 30.0 K. The results contribute to the existing understanding of BK-borophene, highlighting its potential as a member of the expanding family of two-dimensional superconducting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herein we present a comparative study among different mesoporous electron transporter layers (ETLs), namely nanometric m-TiO2, m-SnO2 and m-SnO2 quantum dots (QDs), deposited by spray coating method. The experimental data correlated with the photovoltaic parameters indicate that the SnO2 mesoporous layer obtained from the spray deposition of the in-house prepared QDs solution is the best candidate between the three used mesoporous ETLs. The use of the in-house prepared SnO2 QDs solution presents smaller agglomerates composed of 3 nm NPs resulting in the formation of a thinner, more uniform, and compact mesoporous ETL, compared with the other two ETL solutions. The formamidinium-methylamonium-potassium (FAMA@10K) perovskite deposited on this m-SnO2 QDs ETL presents a lower RMS, more uniformity and, a higher amount of PbI2. Interestingly, this higher concentration for PbI2 seems to enhance the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSC), compared to the other two mesoporous ETLs. Our work reveals that SnO2 QDs solution can be easily produced in the laboratory and it is more suited for the deposition of the mesoporous ETL when choosing a FAMA@10K configuration perovskite solar cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 10%.</description>

      <title>Specific heat analyses on optical-phonon-derived uniaxial negative thermal expansion system $Tr$Zr$_{2}$ ($Tr$ = Fe and Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)</title>

Abstract: Recently, huge uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) along a $c$-axis has been observed in transition-metal ($Tr$) zirconides $Tr$Zr$_{2}$ with a tetragonal CuAl$_{2}$-type structure. In a recent study on FeZr$_{2}$ [M. Xu et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 4439 (2023)], the importance of optical phonons to the emergence of the $c$-axis NTE in FeZr$_{2}$ has been proposed. In this study, the physical properties of $Tr$Zr$_{2}$ ($Tr$ = Fe and Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$) have been studied by specific heat, sound velocity measurements, and theoretical phonon calculations to discuss the importance of optical phonons to the emergence of the $c$-axis NTE in CoZr$_{2}$ and FeZr$_{2}$. From analyses of lattice specific heat, we found that Ni substitution results in a systematic decrease in oscillator strength for the Einstein modes with 8.74 meV (CoZr$_{2}$). From phonon calculations, the low-energy optical phonon branches at the $\Gamma$ point were observed for CoZr$_{2}$ and FeZr$_{2}$ with $c$-axis NTE, but not in NiZr$_{2}$ with positive thermal expansion. The enhancement of phonon density of states near the above-mentioned optical phonon energy in CoZr$_{2}$ and FeZr$_{2}$ is consistent with the specific heat analyses. We propose the importance of the low-energy optical phonons to the emergence of the $c$-axis NTE in TrZr$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>How to Achieve High Spatial Resolution in Organic Optobioelectronic Devices?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light activated local stimulation and sensing of biological cells offers enormous potential for minimally invasive bioelectronic interfaces. Organic semiconductors are a promising material class to achieve this kind of transduction due to their optoelectronic properties and biocompatibility. Here we investigate which material properties are necessary to keep the optical excitation localized. This is critical to single cell transduction with high spatial resolution. As a model system we use organic photocapacitors for cell stimulation made of the small molecule semiconductors H2Pc and PTCDI. We investigate the spatial broadening of the localized optical excitation with photovoltage microscopy measurements. Our experimental data combined with modelling show that resolution losses due to the broadening of the excitation are directly related to the effective diffusion length of charge carriers generated at the heterojunction. With additional transient photovoltage measurements we find that the H2Pc/PTCDI heterojunction offers a small diffusion length of lambda = 1.5 +/- 0.1 um due to the small mobility of charge carriers along the heterojunction. Instead covering the heterojunction with a layer of PEDOT:PSS improves the photocapacitor performance but increases the carrier diffusion length to lambda = 7.0 +/- 0.3 um due to longer lifetime and higher carrier mobility. Furthermore, we introduce electrochemical photocurrent microscopy experiments to demonstrate micrometric resolution with the pn-junction under realistic aqueous operation conditions. This work offers valuable insights into the physical mechanisms governing the excitation and transduction profile and provide design principles for future organic semiconductor junctions, aiming to achieve high efficiency and high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Particle-Particle Random Phase Approximation for Predicting Correlated Excited States of Point Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle-particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) within the hole-hole channel was recently proposed as an efficient tool for computing excitation energies of point defects in solids [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2024, 15, 2757-2764]. In this work, we investigate the application of ppRPA within the particle-particle channel for predicting correlated excited states of point defects, including the carbon-vacancy (VC) in diamond, the oxygen-vacancy (VO) in magnesium oxide (MgO), and the carbon dimer defect (C$_{\text{B}}$C$_{\text{N}}$) in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Starting from a density functional theory calculation of the ($N-2$)-electron ground state, vertical excitation energies of the $N$-electron system are obtained as the differences between the two-electron addition energies. We show that active-space ppRPA with the B3LYP functional yields accurate excitation energies, with errors mostly smaller than 0.1 eV for tested systems compared to available experimental values. We further develop a natural transition orbital scheme within ppRPA, which provides insights into the multireference character of defect states. This study, together with our previous work, establishes ppRPA as a low-cost and accurate method for investigating excited-state properties of point defect systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of the coupling between surface acoustic waves and spin waves in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets host spin waves that are highly tunable. It is of practical interest to analyze the symmetry of their coupling to surface acoustic waves with the design of hybrid devices in view. For this we calculate the layer-resolved susceptibility tensor of a synthetic antiferromagnet, the effective magneto-elastic and magneto-rotation fields associated to a travelling elastic wave, and the power irreversibly transferred by the elastic wave to the magnetic layers. We consider Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves: (a) that travel in an elastically isotropic, non-piezoelectric substrate, or (b) that propagate along the X direction at the surface of a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ substrate, or (c) that are guided in a thin Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ film grown on a sapphire substrate. In particular, we show that the complementary angular dependencies of the acoustic and optical spin wave modes in synthetic antiferromagnets makes it possible to excite spin waves for any relative orientation of magnetization and acoustic wavevector. In addition, we discuss the symmetries of the driving fields and of the energy transferred to the magnetic degree of freedom. We evidence new interaction channels coupling the magnetization eigenmodes when elastic anisotropy and piezoelectricity of the substrate are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread application of III-V colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as non-toxic, highly tunable emitters is stymied by their high density of trap states. Here, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) to investigate trap state formation in a diverse set of realistically passivated core-only InP and GaP QDs. Through orbital localization techniques, we deconvolute the dense manifold of trap states to allow for detailed assignment of surface defects. We find that the three-coordinate species dominate trapping in III-V QDs and identify features in the geometry and charge environment of trap centers capable of deepening, or sometimes passivating, traps. Furthermore, we observe stark differences in surface reconstruction between InP and GaP, where the more labile InP reconstructs to passivate three-coordinate indium at the cost of distortion elsewhere. These results offer explanations for experimentally observed trapping behavior and suggest new avenues for controlling trap states in III-V QDs.</description>

      <title>Emergence of flat bands and ferromagnetic fluctuations via orbital-selective electron correlations in Mn-based kagome metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome lattice has been actively studied for the possible realization of frustration-induced two-dimensional flat bands and a number of correlation-induced phases. Currently, the search for kagome systems with a nearly dispersionless flat band close to the Fermi level is ongoing. Here, by combining theoretical and experimental tools, we present Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ as a novel realization of correlation-induced almost-flat bands in the kagome lattice in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Our magnetic susceptibility, $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance, transport, and optical conductivity measurements provide signatures of a correlated metallic phase with tantalizing ferromagnetic instability. Our dynamical mean-field calculations suggest that such ferromagnetic instability observed originates from the formation of nearly flat dispersions close to the Fermi level, where electron correlations induce strong orbital-selective renormalization and manifestation of the kagome-frustrated bands. In addition, a significant negative magnetoresistance signal is observed, which can be attributed to the suppression of flat-band-induced ferromagnetic fluctuation, which further supports the formation of flat bands in this compound. These findings broaden a new prospect to harness correlated topological phases via multiorbital correlations in 3$d$-based kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled photonic circuits of field-induced dipolaritons with huge nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08289v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrically controlled photonic circuits hold promise for information technologies with greatly improved energy efficiency and quantum information processing capabilities. However, weak nonlinearity and electrical response of typical photonic materials have been two critical challenges. Therefore hybrid electronic-photonic systems, such as semiconductor exciton-polaritons, have been intensely investigated for their potential to allow higher nonlinearity and electrical control, with limited success so far. Here we demonstrate an electrically-gated waveguide architecture for dipolar-polaritons that allows enhanced and electrically-controllable polariton nonlinearities, enabling an electrically-tuned reflecting switch (mirror) and transistor of the dipolar-polaritons. The polariton transistor displays blockade and anti-blockade by compressing a dilute dipolar-polariton pulse exhibiting very strong dipolar interactions. The large nonlinearities are explained using a simple density-dependent polarization field that very effectively screens the external electric field, with an order of magnitude enhancement of the nonlinearities as compared to fixed dipoles. We project that a quantum blockade at the single polariton level is feasible in such a device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Co2MnGe (CMG) has been demonstrated recently as a half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloy which possesses a topologically non-trivial band structure. This behavior is unique to such systems and hence warrants extensive experimental exploration for potential spintronic and chirality sensitive optoelectonic applications. Here, we demonstrate that an epitaxial thin film of CMG acts as a source of THz radiation upon photoexcitation by optical femtosecond laser pulses. Detailed experiments have revealed that a large contribution to THz emission occurs due to nonmagnetic or spin-independent origin, however, significant contribution in the THz generation is evidenced through excitation light helicity dependent circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) confirming the presence of topologically non-trivial carriers. Furthermore, we show that not only the topological contribution is easily suppressed but also the overall THz generation efficiency is also affected adversely for the epitaxial films grown at high substrate temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>
