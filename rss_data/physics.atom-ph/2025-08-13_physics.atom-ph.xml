      <title>Laboratory Measurements of Ca XIX Dielectronic Recombination Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the K$\alpha$ emission from the astrophysically very abundant Ca XIX (He-like ion) and its satellite lines resonantly excited by dielectronic recombination (DR). We achieve an electron-energy resolution of 8 eV in a cryogenic electron beam ion trap, and determine the energies of the exciting electrons and the emitted photons up to the KLn ($n\le 8$) manifold with $0.05\%$ and $0.1\%$ respective uncertainties. For the KLL satellites, energies agree very well with our predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) and previous state-of-the-art calculations. Our calculations also agree with our experimental direct excitation cross-sections for K$\alpha$ within their $10\%$ uncertainty. We extract DR coefficient rates and find good agreement with values tabulated in the OPEN-ADAS database. As an application, we experimentally benchmark Ca XIX atomic data used to model high-temperature astrophysical plasmas by comparing FAC synthetic spectra with recent XRISM observations revealing the contributions of DR satellites to the Ca XIX lines.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a photonic time-frequency Fourier transform and temporal double slit using atomic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aquantummemoryforlightisexpectedtoplayacrucialroleinquantumcommunicationprotocols and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more complex quantum network operations. In this work, we demonstrate an in-memory Fourier transform using a combination of two well-established quantum memory protocols: Gradient Echo Memory and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring similar capability to quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>The interplay between high-harmonic generation and photoluminescence in ZnO: Anisotropic spectral properties of harmonic emission and the role of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear optical response of bulk ZnO under intense short-wave infrared excitation, focusing on the interplay between high-harmonic generation (HHG) and photoluminescence (PL). While HHG exhibits non-perturbative intensity scaling and a spectral blueshift consistent with plasma-induced refractive index changes, the PL signal shows a pronounced superlinear increase and a redshift, attributed to a combination of exciton-exciton scattering and phonon-assisted exciton recombination emission. A similar PL response under above-bandgap excitation supports its intrinsic origin. Spectral analysis of the HHG emission reveals an intensity-driven transition in the characteristics of the fifth harmonic, indicating a change in the underlying generation mechanism. These findings establish PL and spectral HHG analysis as complementary probes of strong-field and many-body effects in wide-bandgap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>A Long-Baseline Atom Interferometer at CERN LHC Point 4: Implementation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al. 2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval, all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed through established engineering solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by superradiant Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by an atomic ensemble when the ensemble is initially prepared in a superradiant Dicke state. We show that while the radiation is well approximated by the Glauber coherent state at early times in the evolution, the emission can be truly quantum at later times. In particular, one can observe a large amount of photon-number squeezing in the emission under certain conditions; even a Fock state can be produced. We discuss the quantum statistics of the emission for various parameters, including different initial conditions for the atomic ensemble. To obtain these results, we have developed a formalism where we are able to calculate the quantum statistics of the emission over long time-scales even when the number of atoms in the ensemble is quite large.</description>

      <title>Precision Test of Bound-State QED at Intermediate-Z with Kaonic Neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report Dirac-Fock calculations of transition energies for kaonic neon (KNe). For the most intense line, the 7-6 transition, the calculated energy is 9450.28 eV, which includes a bound-state QED (BSQED) contribution of 12.66 eV. This is in excellent agreement with the recent SIDDHARTHA-2 measurement at DA$\Phi$NE of 9450.23 $\pm$ 0.37 (stat.) $\pm$ 1.50 (syst.) eV. With the QED shift far exceeding experimental uncertainty, these results establish kaonic atoms as powerful platforms for precision tests of BSQED in intermediate-Z systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Atomic Charge State and Atomic Number for VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer using Deep Neural Networks and Fractionally Labelled Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is a multi-parametric system that integrates ion optical magnetic elements with a multi-detector stack. The magnetic elements, along with the tracking and timing detectors and the trajectory reconstruction method, provide the analysis of the magnetic rigidity, the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer, and the related velocity and mass-over-charge ratio. The segmented ionization chamber provides the energy measurements necessary to analyze the atomic charge state and atomic number. However, this analysis critically suffers from inherent limitations due to the variable thickness and non-uniformity of the entrance window of the ionization chamber and other detector imperfections. Conventionally, this meticulous, detailed analysis is exceptionally tedious, often requiring several months to complete. We present a novel method utilizing deep neural networks, trained on an experimental dataset with only a small fraction of precisely labeled events for the lowest and best-resolved atomic charge states or numbers. This innovative approach enables the networks to autonomously and accurately classify the remaining events. This method drastically accelerates the acquisition of high-resolution atomic charge state and atomic number spectra, reducing analysis time from months to mere hours. Crucially, by discarding human bias, this approach ensures standardized, optimal, and reproducible results with unprecedented efficiency.</description>
