      <title>The ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XI. Statistical Study of Early Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation during the early stages of high-mass star formation is crucial for understanding the formation of high-mass clusters. We investigated fragmentation within thirty-nine high-mass star-forming clumps as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Considering projection effects, we have estimated core separations for 839 cores identified from the continuum emission and found mean values between 0.08 and 0.32 pc within each clump. We find compatibility of the observed core separations and masses with the thermal Jeans length and mass, respectively. We also present sub-clump structures revealed by the 7 m-array continuum emission. Comparison of the Jeans parameters using clump and sub-clump densities with the separation and masses of gravitationally bound cores suggests that they can be explained by clump fragmentation, implying the simultaneous formation of sub-clumps and cores within rather than a step-by-step hierarchical fragmentation. The number of cores in each clump positively correlates with the clump surface density and the number expected from the thermal Jeans fragmentation. We also find that the higher the fraction of protostellar cores, the larger the dynamic range of the core mass, implying that the cores are growing in mass as the clump evolves. The ASHES sample exhibits various fragmentation patterns: aligned, scattered, clustered, and sub-clustered. Using the Q-parameter, which can help to distinguish between centrally condensed and subclustered spatial core distributions, we finally find that in the early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation, cores tend to follow a subclustered distribution.</description>

      <title>Scrutinising evidence for the triggering of Active Galactic Nuclei in the outskirts of massive galaxy clusters at $z\approx1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental effects are believed to play an important yet poorly understood role in triggering accretion events onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of galaxies (Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN). Massive clusters, which represent the densest structures in the Universe, provide an excellent laboratory to isolate environmental effects and study their impact on black hole growth. In this work, we critically review observational evidence for the preferential activation of SMBHs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We develop a semi-empirical model under the assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. We demonstrate that the model is broadly consistent with recent observations on the AGN halo occupation at $z=0.2$, although it may overpredict satellite AGN in massive halos at that low redshift. We then use this model to interpret the projected radial distribution of X-ray sources around high redshift ($z\approx1$) massive ($&gt;5 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) clusters, which show excess counts outside their virial radius. Such an excess naturally arises in our model as a result of sample variance. Up to 20% of the simulated projected radial distributions show excess counts similar to the observations, which are however, because of background/foreground AGN and hence, not physically associated with the cluster. Our analysis emphasises the importance of projection effects and shows that current observations of $z\approx1$ clusters remain inconclusive on the activation of SMBHs during infall.</description>

      <title>CANUCS: An Updated Mass and Magnification Model of Abell 370 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an updated mass and magnification model of galaxy cluster Abell 370 using new NIRCam and NIRISS data from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Using Lenstool and a combination of archival HST and MUSE data with new JWST data as constraints, we derive an improved gravitational lensing model and extract magnifications of background galaxies with uncertainties. Using our best fit model, we perform a search for new multiply imaged systems via predicted positions. We report no new multiply imaged systems with identifiable redshifts, likely due to already very deep HST and Spitzer data, but confirm a $z\sim8$ multiply imaged system by measuring its redshift with NIRISS and NIRSpec spectra. We find that the overall shape of the critical curve for a source at $z = 9.0$ is similar to previous models of Abell 370, with small changes. We investigate the $z\sim8$ galaxy with two images observable with an apparent magnitude in the F125W band of $26.0\pm0.2$ and $25.6\pm0.1$. After correcting for the magnifications of the images, 7.2$^{+0.2}_{-1.2}$ and 8.7$^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, we use SED fitting to find an intrinsic stellar mass of log($M^*/M_{\odot})$ = 7.35$^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, intrinsic SFR of 3.5$^{+2.2}_{-1.4}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr, and $M_{UV}$ of -21.3$^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$, which is close to the knee of the luminosity function at that redshift. Our model, and corresponding magnification, shear, and convergence maps are available on request and will be made publicly available on MAST in a CANUCS data release (DOI: 10.17909/ph4n-6n76).</description>

      <title>A novel Bayesian approach for decomposing the radio emission of quasars: I. Modelling the radio excess in red quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies show that both radio jets from the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the star formation (SF) activity in quasar host galaxies contribute to the quasar radio emission; yet their relative contributions across the population remain unclear. Here, we present an improved parametric model that allows us to statistically separate the SF and AGN components in observed quasar radio flux density distributions, and investigate how their relative contributions evolve with AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_\mathrm{bol}$) and redshift ($z$) using a fully Bayesian method. Based on the newest data from LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, our model gives robust fitting results out to $z\sim4$, showing a quasar host galaxy SFR evolution that increases with bolometric luminosity and with redshift out to $z\sim4$. This differs from the global cosmic SFR density, perhaps due to the importance of galaxy mergers. The prevalence of radio AGN emissions increases with quasar luminosity, but has little dependence on redshift. Furthermore, our new methodology and large sample size allow us to subdivide our dataset to investigate the role of other parameters. Specifically, in this paper, we explore quasar colour and demonstrate that the radio excess in red quasars is due to an enhancement in AGN-related emission, since the host galaxy SF contribution to the total radio emission is independent of quasar colour. We also find evidence that this radio enhancement occurs mostly in quasars with weak or intermediate radio power.</description>

      <title>H2CO and CS in diffuse clouds: Excitation and abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To provide constraints on the chemical processes responsible for the observed columns of organic species, we used NOEMA to observe the sight line toward NRAO150 in the 2mm spectral window. We targeted the low excitation lines of o-H2CO 2(1,1)-1(1,0) and p-H2CO 2(0,2)-1(0,1) as well as the nearby transitions of CS(3-2) and c-C3H2. We combined these data with previous observations to determine the excitation conditions, column densities, and abundances relative to H2 in the different velocity components. We performed non-LTE radiative transfer calculations including collision cross sections with ortho and para H2 and with electrons. New collision cross sections with electrons were computed for ortho and para formaldehyde. The c-C3H2 line profiles are very similar to those of HCO+ and CCH, while the CS absorption features are narrower and mostly concentrated in two main velocity components at V = -17 and -10 km/s. H2CO absorption lines present an intermediate pattern with absorption in all velocity components but larger opacities in the two main velocity components. The ortho-to-para ratios of H2CO and c-C3H2 are consistent with the statistical value of 3. While the excitation temperature of all c-C3H2 velocity components is consistent with the CMB, the two strong components detected in CS show a clear excess over the CMB indicating that CS resides at higher densities than other species along this particular sightline, n(H2) ~ 2500 cm-3 while n(H2) &lt; 500 cm-3 for the other velocity components. We detected faint absorption from o-H213CO and C34S allowing us to derive isotopic ratios: o-H2CO/o-H213CO = 61 and C32S/C34S = 24. The excitation of the 4.8GHz line of formaldehyde is sensitive to the electron fraction and its excitation temperature is predicted to be lower than the CMB at low and moderate electron fractions, x(e)&lt; 6E-5, and to rise above the CMB at high electron fractions, &gt; 1e-4.</description>

      <title>Between the Extremes: A JWST Spectroscopic Benchmark for High Redshift Galaxies Using ~500 Confirmed Sources at $z\geqslant5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional spectra of the most luminous $z&gt;10$ sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at $z=5.0-12.9$ with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find $z=5-11$ galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes ($\beta=-2.3$ to $-2.7$) and inverse Balmer jumps, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous CIII] detections across all redshifts (EW$_{0}=5-14$ \r{A}), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios ($O32=7-31$, $R23=5-8$, and $Ne3O2=1-2$) and subsolar metallicities (log O/H$=7.3-7.9$), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in $z\sim0$ populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Ly$\alpha$-emitters which we stack and compare to a matched sample of non-emitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced CIII], CIV, and HeII+[OIII] line emission, younger stellar populations from inverse Balmer jumps, and a more pristine ISM seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Ly$\alpha$ visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Accretion properties of X-ray AGN: Evidence for radiation-regulated obscuration with redshift-dependent host galaxy contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt a Bayesian X-ray spectral approach to investigate the accretion properties of unobscured ($20&lt;\log(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}&lt;22$) and obscured ($22&lt; \log(N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}&lt;24$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to shed light on the orientation vs evolution scenarios for the origin of the obscuring material. For a sample of 3882 X-ray-selected AGN from the Chandra COSMOS Legacy, AEGIS and CDFS extragalactic surveys, we constrain their stellar masses, $M_\star$, intrinsic X-ray luminosities, $L_{\rm X}$, obscuring column densities, $N_{\rm H}$, and specific accretion rates $\lambda\propto L_{\rm X}/M_\star$. By combining these observables within a Bayesian non-parametric approach, we infer, for the first time, the specific accretion rate distribution (SARD) of obscured and unobscured AGN to $z\approx3$, i.e. the probability of a galaxy with mass $M_\star$ at redshift $z$ hosting an AGN with column density $N_{\rm H}$ and specific accretion rate $\lambda$. Our findings indicate that (1) both obscured and unobscured SARDs share similar shapes, shifting towards higher accretion rates with redshift, (2) unobscured SARDs exhibit a systematic offset towards higher $\lambda$ compared to obscured SARD for all redshift intervals, (3) the obscured AGN fraction declines sharply at $\log\lambda_{\rm break} \sim-2$ for $z &lt;0.5$, but shifts to higher $\lambda$ values with increasing redshift, (4) the incidence of AGN within the theoretically unstable blow-out region of the $\lambda-N_{\rm H}$ plane increases with redshift. These observations provide compelling evidence for AGN "downsizing" and radiation-regulated nuclear-scale obscuration with an increasing host galaxy contribution towards higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Cold Quasar Investigation: Comparing Star Formation Rates to Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold quasars are a rare population of luminous, unobscured quasars associated with host galaxies that have a high star formation rate. We aimed to study the host galaxies of sixty four of these cold quasars in order to probe how the supermassive black holes and host galaxies were coevolving. We compiled data from the XXL survey and crossmatched with the VHS, WISE, and HerMES surveys to obtain multiwavelength photometry spanning the Xray to the infrared and including optical spectroscopy. From the data, we calculated the supermassive black hole masses using broad emission from the magnesium II and hydrogen beta lines. We compared this with the stellar mass of the entire galaxy and find that the black holes are significantly more massive than would be predicted by local relations, indicating that the majority of black hole growth precedes the bulk of the the stellar mass formation. In addition to this, we created a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy to calculate the star formation rate. We compared the star formation rate with the black hole accretion rate and find that the stellar mass is rapidly increasing at a relative rate faster than the black hole growth, supporting the picture where the black hole grows first.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Scaling Relations between the Dark Matter Halo Mass and Observables from Generalised Profiles I: Kinematic Tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between a dark matter halo's mass profile and measures of the velocity dispersion of kinematic tracers within its gravitational potential. By predicting the scaling relation of the halo mass with the aperture velocity dispersion, $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$, we present the expected form and dependence of this halo mass tracer on physical parameters within our analytic halo model: parameterised by the halo's negative inner logarithmic density slope, $\alpha$, its concentration parameter, $c$, and its velocity anisotropy parameter, $\beta$. For these idealised halos, we obtain a general solution to the Jeans equation, which is projected over the line of sight and averaged within an aperture to form the corresponding aperture velocity dispersion profile. Through dimensional analysis, the $M_\mathrm{vir} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relation is devised explicitly in terms of analytical bounds for these aperture velocity dispersion profiles: allowing constraints to be placed on this relation for motivated parameter choices. We predict the $M_{200} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ and $M_{500} - \sigma_\mathrm{ap}$ scaling relations, each with an uncertainty of $60.5\%$ and $56.2\%$, respectively. These halo mass estimates are found to be weakly sensitive to the halo's concentration and mass scale, and most sensitive to the size of the aperture radius in which the aperture velocity dispersion is measured, the maximum value for the halo's inner slope, and the minimum and maximum values of the velocity anisotropy. Our results show that a halo's structural and kinematic profiles impose only a minor uncertainty in estimating its mass. Consequently, spectroscopic surveys aimed at constraining the halo mass using kinematic tracers can focus on characterising other, more complex sources of uncertainty and observational systematics.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Initial Mass function in the Epoch of Reionization from Astrophysical and Cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [abridged] We aim to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) during the epoch of reionization. To this purpose, we build up a semi-empirical model for the reionization history of the Universe, based on various ingredients: the latest determination of the UV galaxy luminosity function from JWST out to redshift $z\lesssim 12$; data-inferred and simulation-driven assumptions on the redshift-dependent escape fraction of ionizing photons from primordial galaxies; a simple yet flexible parameterization of the IMF $\phi(m_\star)\sim m_\star^\xi\, e^{-m_{\star,\rm c}/m_\star}$ in terms of a high-mass end slope $\xi&lt;0$ and of a characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}$ below which a flattening or a bending sets in; the PARSEC stellar evolution code to compute the UV and ionizing emission from different star's masses as a function of age and metallicity; a few physical constraints related to stellar and galaxy formation in faint galaxies at the reionization redshifts. We compare our model outcomes with the reionization observables from different astrophysical and cosmological probes, and perform Bayesian inference on the IMF parameters. We find that the IMF slope $\xi$ is within the range from $-2.8$ to $-2.3$, while appreciably flatter slopes are excluded at great significance. However, the bestfit value of the IMF characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}\sim$ a few $M_\odot$ implies a suppression in the formation of small stellar masses, at variance with the IMF in the local Universe; this may be induced by the thermal background $\sim 20-30$ K provided by CMB photons at the reionization redshifts. Finally, we investigate the implications of our reconstructed IMF on the recent JWST detections of massive galaxies at and beyond the reionization epoch, showing that any putative tension with the standard cosmological framework is substantially alleviated.</description>

      <title>Strong asymptotic giant branch stars' spectral features in distant quiescent galaxies: Impact on galaxy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age-dating and weighting stellar populations in galaxies at various cosmic epochs are essential steps to study galaxy formation through cosmic times. Evolutionary population synthesis models with different input physics are used towards this aim. In particular, the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic-giant-branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase, which peaks for intermediate-age 0.6-2 Gyr systems, has been debated upon for decades. Here we report the detection of strong cool star signatures in the rest-frame near-infrared spectra of three young (~1 Gyr), massive (~10^10 Msun) quiescent galaxies at large look-back time, z=1-2, using JWST/NIRSpec. The co-existence of oxygen- and carbon-type absorption features, spectral edges and features from rare species such as Vanadium, and possibly Zirconium, reveal a strong contribution from TP-AGB stars. Population synthesis models with significant TP-AGB contribution reproduce the observations considerably better than those with weak TP-AGB, which are those commonly used. These findings call for revisions of published stellar population fitting results, pointing to lower masses and younger ages, with additional implications on cosmic dust production and chemical enrichment. These results will stimulate new generations of improved models informed by these and future observations.</description>

      <title>Resolving Dual Active Galactic Nuclei with ~100 pc separation in MCG-03-34-64</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are expected to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). An observational signature of this phenomenon is the detection of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) amongst merging systems, as predicted by cosmological models of structure formation. Dual AGNs at sub-kiloparsec-scale separation are the precursors of merging black hole binaries, an important source of gravitational waves, but a paucity of such systems have been confirmed to date by direct imaging, while other similar claims have been strongly disputed. Here we report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a dual black hole system with a separation of ~100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z=0.016). Chandra/ACIS imaging shows two spatially-resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Ka emission line, consistent with a dual SMBH, which is supported by Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. The separation of ~100 pc is the closest dual AGN separation reported to date with spatially-resolved, multiwavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Satellite quenching and morphological transformation of galaxies in groups and clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role that dense environments have on the quenching of star formation and the transformation of morphology for a sample of galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We make a distinction between galaxies falling into groups $(13 \leq \log{(M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot})} &lt; 14)$ and clusters $(\log{(M_{\text{halo}}/M_{\odot})} \geq 14)$, and compare to a large sample of field galaxies. Using galaxy position in projected phase space as a proxy for time since infall, we study how galaxy specific star formation rate (sSFR) and morphology, parameterized by the bulge-to-total light ratio (B/T), change over time. After controlling for stellar mass, we find clear trends of increasing quenched and elliptical fractions as functions of infall time for galaxies falling into both groups and clusters. The trends are strongest for low mass galaxies falling into clusters. By computing quenching and morphological transformation timescales, we find evidence that star formation quenching occurs faster than morphological transformation in both environments. Comparing field galaxies to recently infalling galaxies, we determine there is pre-processing of both star formation and morphology, with pre-processing affecting star formation rates more strongly. Our analysis favours quenching mechanisms that act quickly to suppress star formation, while other mechanisms that act on longer timescales transform morphology through bulge growth and disc fading.</description>

      <title>HST Survey of the Orion Nebula Cluster in ACS/Visible and WFC3/IR Bands. IV. A Bayesian multicolor study of stellar parameters in the ONC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Observations of spiral and streamer on a candidate proto-brown dwarf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spirals and streamers are the hallmarks of mass accretion during the early stages of star formation. We present the first observations of a large-scale spiral and a streamer towards a very young brown dwarf candidate in its early formation stages. These observations show, for the first time, the influence of external environment that results in asymmetric mass accretion via feeding filaments onto a candidate proto-brown dwarf in the making. The impact of the streamer has produced emission in warm carbon-chain species close to the candidate proto-brown dwarf. Two contrasting scenarios, a pseudo-disk twisted by core rotation and the collision of dense cores, can both explain these structures. The former argues for the presence of a strong magnetic field in brown dwarf formation while the latter suggests that a minimal magnetic field allows large-scale spirals and clumps to form far from the candidate proto-brown dwarf.</description>

      <title>FAUST XI: Enhancement of the complex organic material in the shocked matter surrounding the [BHB2007] 11 protobinary system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: iCOMs are species commonly found in the interstellar medium. They are believed to be crucial seed species for the build-up of chemical complexity in star forming regions as well as our own Solar System. Thus, understanding how their abundances evolve during the star formation process and whether it enriches the emerging planetary system is of paramount importance. We use data from the ALMA Large Program FAUST to study the compact line emission towards the [BHB2007] 11 proto-binary system (sources A and B), where a complex structure of filaments connecting the two sources with a larger circumbinary disk has previously been detected. More than 45 CH3OCHO lines are clearly detected, as well as 8 CH3OCH3 transitions , 1 H2CCO transition and 4 t-HCOOH transitions. We compute the abundance ratios with respect to CH3OH for CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, H2CCO, t-HCOOH (as well as an upper limit for CH3CHO) through a radiative transfer analysis. We also report the upper limits on the column densities of nitrogen bearing iCOMs, N(C2H5CN) and N(C2H3CN). The emission from the detected iCOMs and their precursors is compact and encompasses both protostars, which are separated by only 0.2" (~ 28 au). The integrated intensities tend to align with the Southern filament, revealed by the high spatial resolution observations of the dust emission at 1.3 mm. A PV and 2D analysis are performed on the strongest and uncontaminated CH3OCH3 transition and show three different spatial and velocity regions, two of them being close to 11B (Southern filament) and the third one near 11A. All our observations suggest that the detected methanol, as well as the other iCOMs, are generated by the shocked gas from the incoming filaments streaming towards [BHB2007] 11A and 11B, respectively, making this source one of the few where chemical enrichment of the gas caused by the streaming material is observed.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Dense Rotation-Dominated Structures Fed by Collapsing Gravomagneto-Sheetlets and Origin of Misaligned 100 au-Scale Binaries and Multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of stars are in binary/multiple systems. How such systems form in turbulent, magnetized cores of molecular clouds in the presence of non-ideal MHD effects remains relatively under-explored. Through ATHENA++-based non-ideal MHD AMR simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we show that the collapsing protostellar envelope is dominated by dense gravomagneto-sheetlets, a turbulence-warped version of the classic pseuodisk produced by anisotropic magnetic resistance to the gravitational collapse, in agreement with previous simulations of turbulent, magnetized single-star formation. The sheetlets feed mass, magnetic fields, and angular momentum to a Dense ROtation-Dominated (DROD) structure, which fragments into binary/multiple systems. This DROD fragmentation scenario is a more dynamic variant of the traditional disk fragmentation scenario for binary/multiple formation, with dense spiral filaments created by inhomogeneous feeding from the highly structured larger-scale sheetlets rather than the need for angular momentum transport, which is dominated by magnetic braking. Collisions between the dense spiraling filaments play a key role in pushing the local magnetic Toomre parameter $Q_\mathrm{m}$ below unity, leading to gravitational collapse and stellar companion formation provided that the local material is sufficiently demagnetized, with a plasma-$\beta$ of order unity or more. This mechanism can naturally produce {\it in situ} misaligned systems on the 100-au scale, often detected with high-resolution ALMA observations. Our simulations also highlight the importance of non-ideal MHD effects, which affect whether fragmentation occurs and, if so, the masses and orbital parameters of the stellar companions formed.</description>

      <title>Multiple emission lines of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 2.3$ from the broad and medium-band photometry in the ZFOURGE Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multiple emission lines study of $\sim$1300 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at $z \sim 2.3$ in the ZFOURGE survey. In contrast to the traditional spectroscopic method, our sample is selected based on the flux excess in the ZFOURGE-$K_s$ broad-band data relative to the best-fit stellar continuum. Using the same method, we also extract the strong diagnostic emission lines for these individual HAEs: [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, [OII]$\lambda\lambda3726,3729$. Our measurements exhibit good consistency with those obtained from spectroscopic surveys. We investigate the relationship between the equivalent widths (EWs) of these emission lines and various galaxy properties, including stellar mass, stellar age, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), ionization states (O32). We have identified a discrepancy between between HAEs at $z\sim2.3$ and typical local star-forming galaxy observed in the SDSS, suggesting the evolution of lower gas-phase metallicity ($Z$) and higher ionization parameters ($U$) with redshift. Notably, we have observed a significant number of low-mass HAEs exhibiting exceptionally high $EW_{\mathrm{[OIII]}}$. Their galaxy properties are comparable to those of extreme objects, such as extreme O3 emitters (O3Es) and Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\simeq2-3$. Considering that these characteristics may indicate potential strong Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage, higher redshift anaglogs of the low-mass HAEs could be significant contributors to the cosmic reionization. Further investigations on this particular population are required to gain a clearer understanding of galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission at $z=7-13$: Clear Ly$\alpha$ Equivalent Width Evolution Indicating the Late Cosmic Reionization History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the evolution of Ly$\alpha$ emission derived from 53 galaxies at $z=6.6-13.2$ that are identified by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs of ERS, GO, DDT, and GTO. These galaxies fall on the star-formation main sequence and are the typical star-forming galaxies with UV magnitudes of $-22.5\leq M_\mathrm{UV}\leq-17.0$. We find that 15 out of 53 galaxies show Ly$\alpha$ emission at the $&gt;3\sigma$ levels, and obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) measurements and stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits for the 15 and 38 galaxies, respectively. Confirming that Ly$\alpha$ velocity offsets and line widths of our galaxies are comparable with those of low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters, we investigate the redshift evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ EW. We find that Ly$\alpha$ EWs statistically decrease towards high redshifts on the Ly$\alpha$ EW vs. $M_{\rm UV}$ plane for various probability distributions of the uncertainties. We then evaluate neutral hydrogen fractions $x_{\rm HI}$ with the Ly$\alpha$ EW redshift evolution and the cosmic reionization simulation results on the basis of a Bayesian inference framework, and obtain $x_{\rm HI}&lt;0.37$, $=0.62^{+0.15}_{-0.36}$, and $0.93^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ at $z\sim7$, $8$, and $9-13$, respectively. These moderately large $x_{\rm HI}$ values are consistent with the Planck CMB optical depth measurement and previous $x_{\rm HI}$ constraints from galaxy and QSO Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorptions, and strongly indicate a late reionization history. Such a late reionization history suggests that major sources of reionization would emerge late and be hosted by moderately massive halos in contrast with the widely-accepted picture of abundant low-mass objects for the sources of reionization.</description>

Abstract: We apply methods of particle track reconstruction in High Energy Physics (HEP) to the search for distinct stellar populations in the Milky Way, using the Gaia EDR3 data set. This was motivated by analogies between the 3D space points in HEP detectors and the positions of stars (which are also points in a coordinate space) and the way collections of space points correspond to particle trajectories in the HEP, while collections of stars from distinct populations (such as stellar streams) can resemble tracks. Track reconstruction consists of multiple steps, the first one being seeding. In this note, we describe our implementation and results of the seeding step to the search for distinct stellar populations, and we indicate how the next steps will proceed. Our seeding method uses machine learning tools from the FAISS library, such as the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search.</description>

      <title>Sliding into DM: Determining the local dark matter density and speed distribution using only the local circular speed of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom simulations of Milky Way size disk galaxies to derive easy-to-use relationships between the observed circular speed of the Galaxy at the Solar location, $v_\mathrm{c}$, and dark matter properties of relevance for direct detection experiments: the dark matter density, the dark matter velocity dispersion, and the speed distribution of dark matter particles near the Solar location. We find that both the local dark matter density and 3D velocity dispersion follow tight power laws with $v_\mathrm{c}$. Using this relation together with the observed circular speed of the Milky Way at the Solar radius, we infer the local dark matter density and velocity dispersion near the Sun to be $\rho = 0.42\pm 0.06\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{3D} = 280^{+19}_{-18}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We also find that the distribution of dark matter particle speeds is well-described by a modified Maxwellian with two shape parameters, both of which correlate with the observed $v_{\rm c}$. We use that modified Maxwellian to predict the speed distribution of dark matter near the Sun and find that it peaks at a most probable speed of $250\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and begins to truncate sharply above $470\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This peak speed is somewhat higher than expected from the standard halo model, and the truncation occurs well below the formal escape speed to infinity, with fewer very-high-speed particles than assumed in the standard halo model.</description>

      <title>Insights into Galaxy Morphology and Star Formation: Unveiling Filamentary Structures around an Extreme Overdensity at $z \sim 1.5$ Traced by [OII] Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the morphological features and star formation activities of [OII] emitters in the COSMOS UltraDeep field at $z \sim 1.5$ using JWST NIRCam data from the COSMOS-Web survey and Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. We also report the discovery of large filamentary structures traced by [OII] emitters, surrounding an extremely overdense core with a galaxy number density $\sim11\times$ higher than the field average. These structures span over 50 cMpc, underscoring their large scale in the cosmic web at this epoch. After matching the stellar mass distributions, the core galaxies show a higher frequency of disturbances (50$\%$ $ \pm$ 9$\%$) than those in outskirts (41$\%$ $ \pm$ 9$\%$) and the field (21$\%$ $ \pm$ 5$\%$), indicative of more frequent mergers and interactions in the innermost $\lesssim1.5 $ arcmin region. Additionally, we observe that specific star formation rates are elevated in denser environments. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test comparing the distribution of specific star formation rates of core and field galaxies yields a $\textit{p}$-value of 0.02, suggesting an enhancement of star-formation activity driven by the dense environment. Our findings underscore the environmental impact on galaxy evolution during a pivotal cosmic epoch and set the stage for further investigation with the increasing larger data from upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

      <title>The Aemulus Project VI: Emulation of beyond-standard galaxy clustering statistics to improve cosmological constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is untapped cosmological information in galaxy redshift surveys in the non-linear regime. In this work, we use the AEMULUS suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales ($0.1-50 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics -- the projected correlation function $w_\mathrm{p}(r_\mathrm{p})$, the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function $\xi_0(s)$, and the quadrupole $\xi_2(s)$ -- we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and the density-marked correlation function $M(s)$. This extends the model of AEMULUS III for redshift-space distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest: including $P_\mathrm{U}(s)$ and $M(s)$ improves the precision of our constraints on $\Omega_m$ by 27%, $\sigma_8$ by 19%, and the growth of structure parameter, $f \sigma_8$, by 12% compared to standard statistics. We additionally find that scales below $\sim6 \: h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ contain as much information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the galaxy-halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth of structure as a test of cosmic acceleration.</description>

Abstract: Studying how the black hole (BH) - (galaxy) bulge mass relation evolves with redshift provides valuable insights into the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. However, obtaining accurate measurement of BH masses is challenging due to the bias towards the most massive and luminous galaxies. Instead we focus on the BH and bulge masses as they vary with redshift using the EAGLE, Illustris, TNG100, TNG300, Horizon-AGN and SIMBA large-scale cosmological simulations. We use an analytical astrophysical model with galaxy stellar mass function, pair fraction, merger timescale and BH-bulge mass relation extended to include redshift evolution. The model can predict the intensity of the gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by a population of supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) as a function of the frequency. This allows us to compare the predictions of this model with the constraints of Pulsar Timing Array observations. Here, we employ Bayesian analysis for the parameter inference. We find that all six simulations are consistent $\leq 3.5\sigma$ with a range of simulated GWB spectra. By fixing the BH-bulge mass parameters to the simulations we analyze the changes in the constraints on the other astrophysical parameters. Furthermore, we also examine the variation in SMBHB merger rate with mass and redshift between these large-scale simulations.</description>

Abstract: Mass loss at the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) plays an important role not only in the final fates of stars, but also in the chemical evolution of galaxies. Nevertheless, the metallicity effects on AGB mass loss are not yet fully understood. We present spatially resolved observations of an AGB star, V3, in the metal-poor globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104). The AGB star 47 Tuc V3 was observed using the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2-2.45 micron with a projected baseline length of up to 96 m. The object 47 Tuc V3 has been spatially resolved and stands as the first to attempt to spatially resolve an individual star in a globular cluster. The uniform-disk fit to the observed data results in an angular diameter of ~0.7 mas. Our modeling of the spectral energy distribution and near-infrared interferometric GRAVITY data suggests that the observed data can be explained by an optically thin dust shell with a 0.55 micron optical depth of 0.05-0.25, consisting of metallic iron grains, likely together with effects of the extended atmosphere of the central star. The dust temperature at the inner shell boundary is 500-800 K (corresponding to 23-90 stellar radii), significantly lower than observed in nearby oxygen-rich AGB stars. Radiation pressure on small (&lt; 0.05 micron) iron grains is not sufficient to drive stellar winds. Therefore, iron grains may grow to larger sizes, even in the metal-poor environment. Alternatively, it is possible that the observed iron grain formation is a result of the mass outflow initiated by some other mechanism(s). The sensitivity and angular resolution of VLTI provides a new window onto spatially resolving individual stars in metal-poor globular clusters. This allows us to improve subsequent studies of the metallicity dependence of dust formation and mass loss.</description>
