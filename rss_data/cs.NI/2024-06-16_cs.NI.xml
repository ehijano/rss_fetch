      <title>Carbon-Aware End-to-End Data Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest trends in the adoption of cloud, edge, and distributed computing, as well as a rise in applying AI/ML workloads, have created a need to measure, monitor, and reduce the carbon emissions of these compute-intensive workloads and the associated communication costs. The data movement over networks has considerable carbon emission that has been neglected due to the difficulty in measuring the carbon footprint of a given end-to-end network path. We present a novel network carbon footprint measuring mechanism and propose three ways in which users can optimize scheduling network-intensive tasks to enable carbon savings through shifting tasks in time, space, and overlay networks based on the geographic carbon intensity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mixed Integer Linear Programming Approaches to Dynamic Path Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of single link failure in an elastic optical network, (also known as flex-grid WDM network). The task is to reroute optical connections that go through the broken link using free capacity of other links of the network. Nowadays, dynamic restoration gains popularity, in which the possiblity of rerouting is only inspected after a link failure is detected. Since the problem of recovery is NP-hard, heuristic algorithms are used to either find such routes, or suggest that the routes do not exist. In order to understand the quality of these heuristics, often mixed integer linear programming is used to obtain exact positive and negative answers. We present a detailed such model that checks whether restoration is possible without the use of additional regenerators. This means, that the new light paths need to satisfy a length constraint. As preprossing we apply a trimming procedure that takes advantage of this length constraint, and significantly speeds up the evaluation of these models. Our model is more general, and besides solving the problem of link restoration, also solves the full problem of wavelength and spectrum assignment.</description>

      <title>Intra-QLAN Connectivity: beyond the Physical Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the near to mid future, Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) -- the fundamental building block of the Quantum Internet -- will unlike exhibit physical topologies characterized by densely physical connections among the nodes. On the contrary, it is pragmatic to consider QLANs based on simpler, scarcely-connected physical topologies, such as star topologies. This constraint -- if not properly tackled -- will significantly impact the QLAN performance in terms of communication delay and/or overhead. Thankfully, it is possible to create on-demand links between QLAN nodes, without physically deploying them, by properly manipulating a shared multipartite entangled state. Thus, it is possible to build an overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one. In this paper, we address the fundamental issue of engineering the artificial topology of a QLAN to bypass the limitations induced by the physical topology. The designed framework relays only on local operations, without exchanging signaling among the QLAN nodes, which, in turn, would introduce further delays in a scenario very sensitive to the decoherence. Finally, by exploiting the artificial topology, it is proved that the troubleshooting is simplified, by overcoming the single point of failure, typical of classical LAN star topologies.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Unseen: The REVEAL protocol to expose the wireless Man-in-the-Middle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Man-in-the-Middle (MiM) can collect over-the-air packets whether from a mobile or a base station, process them, possibly modify them, and forward them to the intended receiver. This paper exhibits the REVEAL protocol that can detect a MiM, whether it has half duplex capability, full duplex capability, or double full duplex capability. Protocol is based on synchronizing clocks between the mobile and the base station, with the MiM being detected if it interferes in the synchronization process. Once synchronized, the REVEAL protocol creates a sequence of challenge packets where the transmission times of the packets, their durations, and their frequencies, are chosen to create conflicts at the MiM, and make it impossible for the MiM to function. We implement the REVEAL protocol for detecting a MiM in 4G technology. We instantiate a MiM between the 4G/5G base station and a mobile, and exhibit the successful detection mechanisms. With the shared source code, our work can be reproduced using open software defined cellular networks with off-the-shelf devices</description>

      <title>SemantIC: Semantic Interference Cancellation Towards 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel anti-interference technique, semantic interference cancellation (SemantIC), for enhancing information quality towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. SemantIC only requires the receiver to concatenate the channel decoder with a semantic auto-encoder. This constructs a turbo loop which iteratively and alternately eliminates noise in the signal domain and the semantic domain. From the viewpoint of network information theory, the neural network of the semantic auto-encoder stores side information by training, and provides side information in iterative decoding, as an implementation of the Wyner-Ziv theorem. Simulation results verify the performance improvement by SemantIC without extra channel resource cost.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Multiple Access Connectivity for Networked Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a self-decision goal-oriented multiple access scheme, where sensing agents observe a common event and individually decide to communicate the event's attributes as updates to the monitoring agents, to satisfy a certain goal. Decisions are based on the usefulness of updates, generated under uniform, change- and semantics-aware acquisition, as well as statistics and updates of other agents. We obtain optimal activation probabilities and threshold criteria for decision-making under all schemes, maximizing a grade of effectiveness metric. Alongside studying the effect of different parameters on effectiveness, our simulation results show that the self-decision scheme may attain at least 92% of optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Architectural Blueprint For Heterogeneity-Resilient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel three tier architecture for federated learning to optimize edge computing environments. The proposed architecture addresses the challenges associated with client data heterogeneity and computational constraints. It introduces a scalable, privacy preserving framework that enhances the efficiency of distributed machine learning. Through experimentation, the paper demonstrates the architecture capability to manage non IID data sets more effectively than traditional federated learning models. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential of this innovative approach to significantly improve model accuracy, reduce communication overhead, and facilitate broader adoption of federated learning technologies.</description>
