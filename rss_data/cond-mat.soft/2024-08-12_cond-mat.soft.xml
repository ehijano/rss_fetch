      <title>Analytical model for the motion and interaction of two-dimensional active nematic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approximate, analytical model for the velocity of defects in active nematics by combining recent results for the velocity of topological defects in nematic liquid crystals with the flow field generated from individual defects in active nematics. Importantly, our model takes into account the long-range interactions between defects that result from the flows they produce as well as the orientational coupling between defects inherent in nematics. We show that the model can analytically predict bound states between two $+1/2$ winding number defects, effective attraction between two $-1/2$ defects, and the scaling of a critical unbinding length between $\pm 1/2$ defects with activity. The model also gives predictions for the trajectories of defects, such as the scattering of $+1/2$ defects by $-1/2$ defects at a critical impact parameter that depends on activity. In the presence of circular confinement, the model predicts a braiding motion for three $+1/2$ defects that was recently seen in experiments.</description>

      <title>Receding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have explored receding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces, composed of micropillars arrays. We present here dynamic receding contact angle measurements of water on such surfaces, covering contact line speeds spanning over five decades. We have studied the effect of pillars fraction on dynamical receding contact angles. We compared these measurements to those on smooth surfaces with the same chemical nature and also with similar systems reported in the literature.
  We show that superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit a significantly lower dependence of contact angle on contact line speed compared to smooth surfaces. Additionally, we observed that a higher surface fraction of pillars leads to a greater dependence of the contact angle on contact line speed, approaching the dependence of the angle on smooth surface. Interestingly, we show that the exact texuration of the surface does not play a fundamental role in the angle-velocity relationships as long as microtextures present the same type of periodic pattern (pillar arrays or microgrid). These results are interpreted in terms of viscous friction reduction on superhydrophobic surfaces, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms governing their unique dynamic behavior. In addition we show that contact angles follow same laws for two different geometries (milimetric sessile drop and a centimetric capillary bridge).</description>

      <title>A patchy-particle 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise an ideal 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal that is based upon the 2-dimensional Ammann-Beenker tiling and that is potentially suitable for realization with patchy particles. Based on an analysis of its local environments we design a binary system of 8- and 5-patch particles that in simulations assembles into a 3-dimensional octagonal quasicrystal. The local structure is subtly different from the original ideal quasicrystal possessing a narrower coordination-number distribution; in fact, the 8-patch particles are not needed and a one-component system of the 5-patch particles assembles into an essentially identical octagonal quasicrystal. We also consider a one-component system of the 8-patch particles; this assembles into a cluster with a number of crystalline domains, but which, because of the coherent boundaries between the crystallites, has approximate eight-fold order. We envisage that these systems could be realized using DNA origami or protein design.</description>

      <title>Slip Length in Shear Flow Over a Textured Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrophobic textured surfaces are studied for their low wettability and their capacity to create a 'slippery' fluid on the surface during lubrication. To this end, the flow between two parallel surfaces is numerically addressed by computing two-dimensional numerical simulations. One of the surfaces moves with a uniform rectilinear motion, while the other is fixed, with a cavity in the middle. The steady-state flow is laminar and monophasic with a low Reynolds number. The reduction of the wall shear stress caused by a vortex in the cavity, with respect to a Couette flow, looks like the creation of an equivalent slip of the fluid on the wall at a macroscopic scale.Three methods are used to calculate the slip length: one is based on the wall shear stress and the other two are based on the speed of the fluid flow. When the slip length is calculated according to these three methods, the obtained results differ. The differences show that the slip often used in the literature is a macroscopic representation of local effects that are not necessarily slippery. The speed profiles and the streamlines are then discussed, in order to propose an explanation for this difference.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets \&amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids, examining how their elastic modulus $G$ and their relaxation time $\lambda$ affect jet and droplet formation. We show that the viscoelastic liquids yield Newtonian-like behavior as either parameter $G$ or $\lambda$ approaches zero, while increasing them suppresses jet formation due to elastic resistance to elongational flows. Intriguingly, for some cases with intermediate values of $G$ and $\lambda$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by the elastocapillary number (dimensionless $G$) and the Deborah number (dimensionless $\lambda$), we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Evaluating fracture energy predictions using phase-field and gradient-enhanced damage models for elastomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the phase field method has been increasingly used for brittle fractures in soft materials like polymers, elastomers, and biological tissues. When considering finite deformations to account for the highly deformable nature of soft materials, the convergence of the phase-field method becomes challenging, especially in scenarios of unstable crack growth. To overcome these numerical difficulties, several approaches have been introduced, with artificial viscosity being among the most widely utilized. This study investigates the energy release rate due to crack propagation in hyperelastic nearly-incompressible materials and compares the phase-field method and a novel gradient-enhanced damage (GED) approach. First, we simulate unstable loading scenarios using the phase-field method, which leads to convergence problems. To address these issues, we introduce artificial viscosity to stabilize the problem and analyze its impact on the energy release rate utilizing a domain J-integral approach giving quantitative measurements during crack propagation. It is observed that the measured energy released rate during crack propagation does not comply with the imposed critical energy release rate, and shows non-monotonic behavior. In the second part of the paper, we introduce a novel stretch-based GED model as an alternative to the phase-field method for modeling crack evolution in elastomers. It is demonstrated that in this method, the energy release rate can be obtained as an output of the simulation rather than as an input which could be useful in the exploration of rate-dependent responses, as one could directly impose chain-level criteria for damage initiation. We show that while this novel approach provides reasonable results for fracture simulations, it still suffers from some numerical issues that strain-based GED formulations are known to be susceptible to.</description>

      <title>Structural origin of relaxation in dense colloidal suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous solids relax via slow molecular rearrangement induced by thermal fluctuations or applied stress. Although microscopic structural signatures predicting these structural relaxations have long been sought, a physically motivated structural measure relevant to diverse systems remains elusive. Here, we introduce a structural order parameter derived from the mean-field caging potential experienced by the particles due to their neighbors, which reliably predicts the occurrence of structural relaxations. The parameter, derived from density functional theory, is a measure of susceptibility to particle rearrangements that can effectively identify weak or defect-like regions in disordered systems. Using experiments on dense colloidal suspensions, we demonstrate a causal relationship between this order parameter and the structural relaxations of the amorphous solid. In quiescent suspensions, increasing the density leads to stronger correlations between the structure and dynamics. Under applied shear, the mean structural order parameter increases with increasing strain, signaling shear-induced softening, which is accompanied by the proliferation of plastic events. In both cases, the order parameter reliably identifies weak regions where the plastic rearrangements due to thermal fluctuation or applied shear preferentially occur. Our study paves the way to a structural understanding of the relaxation of a wide range of amorphous solids, from suspensions to metallic glasses.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of forces in air-based acoustic levitation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation is frequently used for non-contact manipulation of objects and to study the impact of microgravity on physical and biological processes. While the force field produced by sound pressure lifts particles against gravity (primary acoustic force), multiple levitating objects in the same acoustic cavity interact via forces that arise from scattered sound (secondary acoustic forces). Current experimental techniques for obtaining these force fields are not well-suited for mapping the primary force field at high spatial resolution and cannot directly measure the secondary scattering force. Here we introduce a method that can measure both acoustic forces in situ, including secondary forces in the near-field limit between arbitrarily shaped, closely spaced objects. Operating similarly to an atomic force microscope, the method inserts into the acoustic cavity a suitably shaped probe tip at the end of a long, flexible cantilever and optically detects its deflection. This makes it possible to measure forces with a resolution better than 50 nN, and also to apply stress or strain in a controlled manner to manipulate levitated objects. We demonstrate this by extracting the acoustic potential present in a levitation cavity, directly measuring the acoustic scattering force between two objects, and applying tension to a levitated granular raft of acoustically-bound particles in order to obtain the force-displacement curve for its deformation.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous and Induced Oscillations in Confined Epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The feedback between mechanical and chemical signals plays a key role in controlling many biological processes and collective cell behavior. Here we focus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional "cell train." Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in vitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear pattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between myosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response of the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and frequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell train, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic spontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to external boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency, providing a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that control the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.</description>
