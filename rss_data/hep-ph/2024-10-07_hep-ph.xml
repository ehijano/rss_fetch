      <title>Accessing Generalized Parton Distributions through $2 \to 3$ exclusive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our results on a new class of $2 \to 3$ exclusive processes, as a probe of both chiral-even and chiral-odd quark GPDs. We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a photon-meson pair, in the kinematics where the pair has a large invariant mass, described in the collinear factorization framework. We cover the whole kinematical range from medium energies in fixed target experiments to very large energies of colliders, by considering the experimental conditions of JLab 12-GeV, COMPASS, future EIC and LHC (in ultra-peripheral collisions) cases. Our analysis covers neutral and charged rho-mesons, as well as charged pions. The case of the rho-meson, depending on its polarization, provides access to either chiral-even or chiral-odd GPDs, at leading twist. We find that the order of magnitude of the obtained cross sections are sufficiently large for a dedicated experimental analysis to be performed, especially at JLab. Furthermore, we compute the linear photon beam polarization asymmetry, which we find to be sizeable, in the case of a longitudinally polarized $\rho$-meson or of a charged pion. These predictions are obtained for both asymptotic distribution amplitude (DA) and holographic DA.</description>

      <title>Unearthing Neutrino Decoherence from Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of \(\kappa\) Minkowski-type quantum spacetime on neutrino oscillations, revealing that spacetime fluctuations introduce a unique energy-dependent power law, \(E^{-4}\), in the decoherence effect for relic neutrinos. This effect is particularly pronounced for low-energy neutrinos, such as those from the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results indicate the potential for new models of low-energy quantum gravity-induced decoherence, which could pave the way for future experiments, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, to further constrain the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Axion Couplings in Heterotic String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupling of axions to gauge bosons in heterotic string theory. The axion-gauge boson couplings in the low energy 4d theory are derived by matching mixed anomalies between higher-form global symmetries and the zero-form gauge symmetry in the 10d theory. When the standard model gauge group is embedded in a single simple group in the 10d theory -- as is the case for almost all heterotic models studied in the literature -- the ratio of the axion-photon coupling to the axion mass is bounded above by the QCD line. This bound is relevant for a large number of axion searches which have sensitivity to axion parameter space above this line. The discovery of an axion in these searches will rule out a large class of heterotic models, making such a signal challenging to explain within heterotic string theory.</description>

      <title>A general mass variable flavor number scheme for $Z$ boson production in association with a heavy quark at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology to streamline implementation of massive-quark radiative contributions in calculations with a variable number of active partons in proton-proton collisions. The methodology introduces \textit{subtraction} and \textit{residual} heavy-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) to implement calculations in the Aivazis-Collins-Olness-Tung (ACOT) factorization scheme and its simplified realization in various processes up to the next-to-the-next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling strength. Interpolation tables for bottom-quark subtraction and residual distributions for CT18 NLO and NNLO PDF ensembles are provided in the common LHAPDF6 format. A numerical calculation of $Z$-boson production with at least one $b$ jet at the Large Hadron Collider beyond the lowest order in QCD is considered for illustration purposes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Particle Production of Scalars: Analytic and Numerical Approaches Including Early Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Impressions of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (DFs) have long been recognised as key measures of hadron structure. Today, theoretical prediction of such DFs is becoming possible using diverse methods for continuum and lattice analyses of strong interaction (QCD) matrix elements. Recent developments include a demonstration that continuum and lattice analyses yield mutually consistent results for all pion DFs, with behaviour on the far valence domain of light-front momentum fraction that matches QCD expectations. Theory is also delivering an understanding of the distributions of proton mass and spin amongst its constituents, which varies, of course, with the resolving scale of the measuring probe. Aspects of these developments are sketched herein.</description>

      <title>Studying the $B_{d(s)} \rightarrow K^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{(\ast)}$ puzzle and $B^+ \rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ in $R$-parity violating MSSM with seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-leptonic puzzle of $B_{d(s)} \rightarrow K^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{(\ast)}$ decay in the $R$-parity violating minimal supersymmetric standard model (RPV-MSSM) extended with the inverse seesaw mechanism. In this model, the chiral flip of sneutrinos can contribute to the observables $L_{K\bar{K}}$ and $L_{K^{\ast}\bar{K}^{\ast}}$, that is benefit for explaining the relevant puzzle. We also find that this unique effect can engage in the $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ mixing. We utilize the scenario of complex $\lambda^\prime$ couplings to fulfill the recent stringent constraint of $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ mixing, and examine other related bounds of $B,K$-meson decays, lepton decays, neutrino data, $Z$-pole results, CP violations (CPV), etc. Besides, inspired by the new measurement of ${\cal B}(B^+ \rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ by Belle II, which shows about $2.7\sigma$ higher than the Standard Model (SM) prediction, we investigate the NP enhancement to this observable and find this tension can also be explained in this model.</description>

      <title>The Revival of $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$: A Natural Solution for $(g-2)_\mu$ with a Sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experiments searching for a hidden gauge sector with a leptophilic neutral gauge boson have already ruled out $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$ as a feasible extension of the Standard Model (SM) gauge group ($\mathcal{G}_{\rm SM}$) for explaining the observed discrepancy in $(g-2)_\mu$. The paper proposes a simple extension of the minimal particle content of $\mathcal{G}_{\rm SM}\otimes U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$ with a TeV-scale scalar leptoquark $S_1$. Due to the non-trivial transformation of $S_1$ under $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$, the model generates additional one-loop contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$, reviving the considered gauge extension within the experimentally allowed regions of the parameter space. The model can also accommodate a viable Dark Matter (DM) candidate $\chi$ -- a vector-like SM-singlet fermion in the sub-GeV mass regime. The theory provides a natural framework to test the proposed DM phenomenology through electron excitation signals. Moreover, the DM-specific observables and $(g-2)_\mu$ being connected through the New Physics (NP) parameters, the future beam dump experiments hunting for light, feebly interacting particles and the DM direct detection experiments are complementary to each other for constraining/falsifying the model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electroweak Baryogenesis: The Role of Dimension-Six Operators in the Real Singlet Extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) in the real singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM), including dimension-six operators, which couple the Higgs boson to a real singlet scalar field. We show that the electroweak phase transition is a one-step or a two-step phase transition, depending on the parameters of the singlet extension. In the majority of the parameter space, the electroweak phase transition proceeds as a two-step phase transition: an initial phase transition in the singlet sector at high temperatures, followed by a first-order phase transition in the Higgs sector. Interestingly, including the dimension-six operator, the electroweak phase transition occurs in regions of the parameter space, which were ruled out in the singlet extensions of the SM without the dimension-six operator. This is more evident for low singlet masses, which are excluded by the experimental constraints from the invisible decays of the Higgs boson. In addition, the real singlet extension explains the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe introducing an additional source of \(CP\) violation in the SM via a second dimension-six operator, which contributes to the top-quark mass. These results provide new pathways for EWBG, expanding the viable parameter space for future collider and gravitational wave experiments, especially for low singlet masses.</description>

      <title>Do Finite Density Effects Jeopardize Axion Nucleophobia in Supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleophobic axion models, wherein axion couplings to both protons and neutrons are simultaneously suppressed, can relax the stringent constraints from SN 1987A. However, it remains uncertain whether these models maintain their nucleophobic property under the influence of finite baryon density effects. These are especially relevant in astrophysical environments near saturation density, such as Supernovae (SNe). In this study, we demonstrate that the nucleophobic solution remains viable also at finite density. Furthermore, we show that the SN axion bound relaxes significantly in nucleophobic models, even when accounting for the integration over the non-homogeneous environment of the SN core.</description>

      <title>Multicritical-Point Principle Is All You Need for Toponium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the coupling constant of a newly discovered top quark pair is predicted. For this purpose, this paper considers a pseudo scalar mediating top quarks. For predicting the coupling constant, the multicritical-point principle (MPP) is used to determine the effective potential. And a few remarks will be made on the non-perturbative effects of toponium. As a result, the coupling constant of a newly discovered top quark pair is predicted to be about $0.85$--$0.86$. The pseudo scalar field is also found to improve the vacuum stability associated with the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach: An Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist two distinct ways in realizing the approximate SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD to describe the two-body nonleptonic decays of charmed baryons: the irreducible SU(3) approach (IRA) and the topological diagram approach (TDA). The TDA has the advantage that it is more intuitive, graphic and easier to implement model calculations. We perform a global fit to the currently available data of two-body charmed baryon decays within the framework of the TDA and IRA. The number of the minimum set of tensor invariants in the IRA and the topological amplitudes in the TDA is the same, namely, five in the tree-induced amplitudes and four in the penguin amplitudes. Since we employ the new LHCb measurements to fix the sign ambiguity of the decay parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$, the fit results for the magnitudes of $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes and their phase shift $\delta_P-\delta_S$ in both the TDA and IRA are more trustworthy than our previous analyses with uncertainties substantially improved. These results can be tested in the near future. The perspective of having direct {\it CP} violation in the charmed baryon sector at the per mille level is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis from magnetic helicity of gauged $\text{U}(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the $B-L$ symmetry is gauged with the addition of right-handed neutrinos, the standard model $B-L$ current is anomalous with respect to the $B-L$ gauge field itself. Then, the anomaly relation implies that the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is related to the standard model $B-L$ charges, although the whole universe is $B-L$ neutral with right-handed neutrinos. Based on this, we propose a new leptogenesis scenario with the gauged $B-L$ symmetry as follows. First, the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field is generated, e.g., by the axion inflation, together with the standard model and right-handed neutrino $B-L$ charges, with the net $B-L$ charge kept zero. The $B-L$ charges in the standard model and right-handed neutrino sectors are then subject to washout effects from the interactions between them. After the washout effects decouple, the $B-L$ gauge symmetry is Higgsed and the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field decays and generates $B-L$ charges in the both sector; thanks to the washout effects, we obtain a non-zero $B-L$ asymmetry. We show that the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated in this scenario, discussing the decay of the magnetic helicity of the $B-L$ gauge field and the interactions between the right-handed neutrinos and the standard model particles.</description>

      <title>Dark matter interpretation of GRB 221009A: a singlet scalar explains LHAASO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we find a new signal of dark matter (DM) through an intensive gamma ray burst (GRB), called GRB 221009A. This indirect detection approach devotes to the decay of DM particles into high energy (HE) photons. In this context, a singlet scalar DM generated at the redshift of the GRB is up-scattered by the high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) during its propagation to Earth. This highly boosted DM then possesses a high flux and undergoes a dominant di-photon decay before reaching the detector. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) probes such energetic gamma rays whereby has recorded a 18 TeV event for the aforementioned GRB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of a rotation on the string tension and the temperature of the confinement-deconfinement transition of gluodynamics by gauge/gravity duality. We explore two distinct approaches, global transformation and local transformation, to introduce rotation and compare the results. It is shown that the string tension extracted from the free energy in the presence of a heavy quarkonium decreases with the increasing angular velocity, while the transition temperature determined by the Polyakov loop increases with increasing angular velocity, which is in line with lattice simulations.</description>

Abstract: In order to understand the early history of the universe, and to test baryogenesis models, determining the nature of the electroweak phase transition is imperative. The order and strength of this transition is strongly correlated to relatively large deviations in the $hhh$ coupling. In models where a considerable part of the $hhh$ coupling deviation is caused by charged particle loops, the $h\gamma\gamma$ coupling is also expected to deviate considerably. In this talk, by using a model-independent approach, I explain how to obtain conditions that are sufficient for a strongly first order phase transition. After the $h\gamma\gamma$ coupling is determined with precision at the HL-LHC, these conditions can be tested at Future Linear Colliders by measurements of the $hhh$ coupling, to conclusively determine the nature of the electroweak phase transition and the viability of electroweak baryogenesis on models with new charged scalars.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of Lorentz-violating Maxwell fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the Lorentz-violating modifications of the propagation properties of the massless photon in the null formalism. Starting with the Maxwell Lagrangian in the minimal standard model extension, we derive the Maxwell equations in the null formalism based on the fact that at leading order of optical approximation, the light cone structure for the CPT-violating (CPTV) $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term is unaltered, though it does receive higher order corrections. Assuming the order expansion as $\phi_0=\sum_{n=1}\phi^{n-1}_0/r^{n+2}$ and reserving only leading order corrections of the $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term, we find that the asymptotic behaviors of the three complex scalars deviate from the LI counterparts, namely, $\phi_a^0\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{a-3})$ is no longer valid provided $k^2\neq0$. Our results also gives unnatural constraints: $k^2+4k^1=0$ and $\mathrm{Re}[\phi_1^0]=0$. We attribute this unnaturalness may be the flaw of our perturbative treatment,by comparison with the formal dipole radiation solutions in Ref. \cite{vacuoCerenRad}. In other words, we conjecture that the non-perturbative nature of the CPTV modification of the polarization structure may forbid a consistent perturbative treatment of the NP equations. If that is true, then the exact results reveal that not only CPTV modifies the phase factor as a kinematic effect, it also modifies the amplitude and the asymptotic behavior of the radiation and Coulomb modes as dynamical effects. This dramatically changes the peeling law of the two modes at large distances, which may provide new signal of the deviation from exact Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hartree-Fock all-heavy $c$, $b$ multiquarks and constraints on new top-sector physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deploy the Hartree-Fock approximation for all-heavy quark hadrons, including quarkonium, baryons, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, dibaryons and up to the 12-body dibaryon-antidibaryon which completely fill the $1s$ orbital, in a unified manner, with the spinless LO Coulomb interaction and beyond. After treating the $c$ and $b$ quarks in various combinations, we delve a bit longer on $t$-quark bound states. We extend the negative result of Kuchiev, Flambaum and Shuryak on the 12-body topball to now include the NLO QCD potential. We find that none of the examined multitop states should have binding energy exceeding their width in the Standard Model. Additional new-physics interactions can then be constrained by experimental searches for these bound states, assuming they are not detected, at a level somewhat less stringent than standing HEFT bounds, but with different systematics.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Energy-Energy Correlators for Heavy Flavor Tagged Jets in pp, p+Pb and Pb+Pb Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, energy-energy correlator (EEC) distributions for the $\rm D^0$, $\rm B^0$-tagged, inclusive, and the PYTHIA generated pure quark jets are computed in pp, p+Pb, and Pb+Pb collisions at \sqrts =5.02 TeV for a same jet transverse momentum interval 15-30 GeV. We find the number of particles per jet determines the height of the EEC distribution in pp baseline. The averaged energy weight distribution resulted in a shift of the originally larger angular distributed particle distribution to a smaller RL, thereby obtaining an EEC distribution. The EEC distributions for all quark-tagged jets in A+A exhibit a noticeable shift towards larger RL region, suggesting that the jets will be more widely distributed compared to those in pp collisions. The jet quenching effect will cause the pair angular distribution to shift towards larger values and increase the number of particles per jet. This redistribution of energy within the jets suggests that the already reduced jet energy is redistributed among a larger number of particles, leading to a reduced energy weight per pair. The enhancement of the number of particles per jet and the reduced averaged energy weight interplay with each other to form the medium modification of EEC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the possible emergence of Efimov states in the $D^*D^*D^*$ system with $J^P=0^-$ and isospin $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$, assuming the existence of the heavy partner of the $T_{cc}^+$, dubbed $T_{cc}^*$, near the $D^*D^*$ threshold as predicted by Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry. We find that $(I)J^P=(\frac{1}{2})0^-$ three-body bound states can be formed, with properties that suggest that the Efimov effect can be realised for reasonable values of the molecular probability and binding energy of the $T_{cc}^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order calculation of the matching coefficients that link unpolarized flavor non-singlet parton distribution functions with lattice QCD computable correlation functions. By using this high-order result, we notice a reduction in theoretical uncertainties compared to relying solely on previously known lower-order matching coefficients. Furthermore, based on this result we have extracted the three-loop unpolarized flavor non-singlet splitting function, which is in agreement with the state-of-the-art result. Due to the simplicity of our method, it has the potential to advance the calculation of splitting functions to the desired four-loop order.</description>

      <title>How charming can the Higgs be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of the Higgs boson to first and second generation fermions has yet to be measured experimentally. There still could be very large deviations in these couplings, as the origin of flavor is completely unknown. Nevertheless, if Yukawa couplings are modified, especially for light generations, there are generically strong constraints from flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs). Therefore, it is imperative to understand whether there exists viable UV physics consistent with current data that motivates future Higgs coupling probes. In particular, the charm-quark Yukawa is the next quark coupling that could be measured at the LHC if it is a few times larger than the SM and compatible with flavor data. This is difficult to achieve in the context of standard ansatz such as Minimal Flavor Violation. In this paper we show that within the framework of Spontaneous Flavor Violation (SFV), using a Two Higgs Doublet Model as an example, the Higgs can be sufficiently charming that new LHC probes are relevant. In this charming region, we show that new Higgs states near the EW scale with large couplings to quarks are required, providing complementary observables or new constraints on the SM Yukawa couplings. The down-type SFV mechanism enabling the suppression of FCNCs also allows for independent modifications to the up-quark Yukawa coupling, which we explore in detail as well.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations in Presence of Diagonal Elements of Scalar NSI: An Analytic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar Non-Standard Interactions (SNSI) in neutrinos can arise when a scalar mediator couples to both neutrinos and standard model fermions. This beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenario is particularly interesting as the SNSI contribution appears as a density-dependent perturbation to the neutrino mass, rather than appearing as a matter-induced potential, and the neutrino oscillation probabilities uniquely depend on the absolute neutrino masses. In this work, we show the complex dependence of the SNSI contributions on the neutrino masses and discuss how the mass of the lightest neutrino would regulate any possible SNSI contribution in both mass ordering scenarios. We derive the analytic expressions for neutrino oscillation probabilities, employing the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, in the presence of diagonal elements of SNSI. The expressions are compact and shows explicit dependence on matter effects and the absolute neutrino masses. The analytic expressions calculated here allow us to obtain the dependence of the SNSI contribution on mass terms of the form $m_1 + m_2$, $m_2 - m_1$, $m_1c_{12}^2 + m_2s_{12}^2,$ $ m_1s_{12}^2 + m_2c_{12}^2$, and $m_3$. We then explore the non-trivial impact of neutrino mass ordering on the SNSI contribution. The dependence of the SNSI contribution on the 3$\nu$ parameters is then thoroughly explored using our analytic expressions.</description>

      <title>Interpolation of rational functions in loop calculations by using p-adic numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation and manipulation of large multi-variable rational functions is a key bottleneck in multi-loop calculations. In these conference proceedings, based on my article [Chawdhry (2023) arXiv:2312.03672], I present a technique to interpolate such rational functions in a compact form by evaluating them at special integer points chosen for their properties under a $p$-adic absolute value. I apply the technique to examples of large rational functions appearing in 2-loop 5-point massless non-planar amplitude calculations in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The number of required numerical probes (per field) is found to be around 25 times smaller than in conventional techniques, and the obtained result is 130 times smaller.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric QCD on the lattice: Fine-tuning and counterterms for the Yukawa and quartic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we determine the fine-tuning of parameters in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ Supersymmetric QCD, discretized on a Euclidean lattice. Our focus is on the renormalization of Yukawa (gluino-quark-squark interactions) and quartic (four-squark interactions) couplings. Given that SUSY is broken on the lattice, non-supersymmetric counterterms must be added to the discretized Lagrangian, with coefficients which must be appropriately fine-tuned in order to recover SUSY in the continuum limit. To deduce the renormalization factors and the coefficients of the counterterms, we compute the relevant three-point (for the Yukawa couplings) and four-point Green's functions (for the quartic couplings) perturbatively to one-loop and to the lowest order in lattice spacing. Both dimensional and lattice regularizations are used to implement the Modified Minimal Subtraction scheme. Our lattice formulation employs the Wilson discretization for gluino and quark fields, the Wilson gauge action for gluons, and naive discretization for squark fields. One main difficulty in this study lies in the fact that different components of squark fields mix among themselves at the quantum level. Consequently, for an appropriate fine-tuning of the couplings, these mixings must be taken into account in the renormalization conditions. All Green's functions and renormalization factors exhibit an explicit dependence on the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of flavors, $N_f$, and the gauge parameter, $\alpha$, which are left unspecified. This work follows previous investigations on SQCD and finalizes the one-loop fine-tuning of the SQCD action on the lattice, paving the way for numerical simulations of SQCD.</description>

      <title>Kubo formula for spin hydrodynamics: spin chemical potential as leading order in gradient expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-order dissipative spin hydrodynamic framework, where the spin chemical potential $\omega^{\mu\nu}$ is treated as the leading term in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion, i.e., $\omega^{\mu\nu}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. We argue that for the consistency of the theoretical framework, the energy-momentum tensor needs to be symmetric at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\partial)$. We consider the phenomenological form of the spin tensor, where it is anti-symmetric in the last two indices only. A comprehensive analysis of spin hydrodynamics is conducted using both macroscopic entropy current analysis and microscopic Kubo formalism, establishing consistency between the two approaches. A key finding is the entropy production resulting from spin-orbit coupling, which alters the traditional equivalence between the Landau and Eckart fluid frames. Additionally, we identify cross-diffusion effects, where vector dissipative currents are influenced by gradients of both spin chemical potential and chemical potential corresponding to the conserved charge through off-diagonal transport coefficients. Two distinct methods for decomposing the spin tensor are proposed, and their equivalence is demonstrated through Kubo relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of charm degrees of freedom near the chiral crossover based on lattice QCD calculations of the second and fourth-order cumulants of charm fluctuations, and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations. We show that below the chiral crossover temperature, $T_{pc}$, the thermodynamics of charm can be very well understood in terms of charmed hadrons. We present evidence that above $T_{pc}$, however, charm quark-like excitations emerge as new degrees of freedom contributing to the partial charm pressure. Nonetheless, up to temperatures as high as 175 MeV, charmed hadron-like excitations significantly contribute to the partial charm pressure.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling for Identified Mesons and Baryons: Insights into Medium Transport Properties, Equation of State and Hadronic Re-scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for identified mesons and baryons are derived from species-dependent measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy coefficients \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T, \text{cent})\), in Pb+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76\) TeV and 5.02 TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44\) TeV, and Au+Au collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 0.2\) TeV. The scaling functions capture species-specific responses to radial flow and hadronic re-scattering, demonstrating consistency across flow- and jet-quenching-dominated \(p_T\) regions. These results provide robust constraints on fundamental transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), including the specific shear viscosity \(\eta/s\) and the jet-quenching parameter \(\hat{q}\), as well as insight into the centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow, a vital aspect of the system's dynamics. The findings reveal minimal influence from hadronic re-scattering at high beam energies and significant influence from re-scattering at lower energies. The centrality-dependent evolution of radial flow and the beam energy dependence of \(\eta/s\) offer new constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of the QGP, with important implications for advancing studies of QGP transport properties and heavy-ion collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two dark components of de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath for matter with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter. Here do not consider the real matter, but only the component which is related to the gravitational degrees of freedom and participates the thermodynamics of the de Sitter state. This gravitational component behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter. The vacuum energy and the analog of the Zel'dovich stiff matter represent correspondingly the dark energy and dark matter. In equilibrium the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is rather similar to the correspondingly superfluid and normal components of superfluid liquid, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. We extend this two dark components approach and the suggest the phenomenological theory, which describes the dynamics of the dark energy and the dark matter. For that we assume that the in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter also behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter. In this phenomenological model, both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. How this phenomenology is supported by the microscopic physics is an open question.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagrams of Relativistic Selfinteracting Boson System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Canonical Ensemble, we investigate a system of interacting relativistic bosons at finite temperatures and finite isospin densities in a mean-field approach. The mean field contains both attractive and repulsive terms. Temperature and isospin-density dependencies of thermodynamic quantities were obtained. It is shown that in the case of attraction between particles in a bosonic system, a liquid-gas phase transition develops against the background of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The corresponding phase diagrams are given. We explain the reasons why the presence of a Bose condensate significantly increases the critical temperature of the liquid-gas phase transition compared to that obtained for the same system within the framework of the Boltzmann statistics. Our results may have implications for the interpretation of experimental data, in particular, how sensitive the critical point of the mixed phase is to the presence of the Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Landau Yang Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau Yang theorem is well known for the past several decades. It prohibits decay of a massive spin 1 particle to two photons. This emerges simply from the representation theory of the Poincare group and Bose Statistics. It does not require any action or Lagrangian. We generalize this theorem to theories with supersymmetry (SUSY) which disallows even decay to two photinos (Majorana fermions). We will prove that if the photon has a mass, howsoever small, this theorem can be evaded. We also show that the supersymmetric selection rule above can also be evaded through the Stueckelberg mass term. Further interesting implications are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Probing for an IR-fixed Point in QCD by Superallowed Gamow-Teller Transitions in Doubly Magic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This brief note is to point out that the recent measurements at GSI and RIKEN of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly magic closed-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn could give an indication for a possibly important {\it fundamental} quenching, thus-far unrecognized, of $g_A$, unambiguously distinct from nuclear correlation effects in the framework of nuclear effective field theory. The result, either confirmed or ruled out both experimentally and theory, can have strong impacts on nuclear physics vis-\`a-vis with nuclear effective field theory as well as on particle physics relevant for going beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>The underlying black hole phase transitions in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a holographic critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model exhibits a first-order phase transition curve that terminates at a holographic critical endpoint, offering intriguing insights into the phase diagram of the dual system living on the boundary. However, the specific instability within the underlying spacetime that triggers the formation of the hairy black hole remains somewhat obscure. This raises the question of whether one of the hairy black hole phases represents a superconducting or scalarized state and how the two distinct phases merge into a indistinguishable one at the critical point. This work investigates the associated black hole phase transition and the underlying instabilities by exploring a specific Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model. The approach aims to provide transparent insights into the black hole phase transitions in the bulk. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between a massive real scalar field and a Maxwell field in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, we identify two types of scalarization corresponding to tachyonic instabilities in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. These distinct instabilities lead to a first-order phase transition between two phases in the $\mu-T$ phase diagram. Furthermore, this first-order transition terminates at a critical point, beyond which the curve turns back, and the transition becomes a numerically elusive third-order one. Although one does not encounter a critical endpoint, the model still offers a consistent interpretation for the observed {\it cross-over} in the low baryon density region. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the scalarized hairy black holes and discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Observatory Research of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): X-ray Flare Related Phenomena and Multi-epoch Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most powerful stellar flares driven by magnetic energy occur during the early pre-main sequence (PMS) phase. The Orion Nebula represents the nearest region populated by young stars, showing the greatest number of flares accessible to a single pointing of Chandra. This study is part of a multi-observatory project to explore stellar surface magnetic fields (with HET-HPF), particle ejections (VLBA), and disk ionization (ALMA) immediately following the detection of PMS super-flares with Chandra. In December 2023, we successfully conducted such a multi-telescope campaign. Additionally, by analyzing Chandra data from 2003, 2012, and 2016, we examine the multi-epoch behavior of PMS X-ray emission related to PMS magnetic cyclic activity and ubiquitous versus sample-confined mega-flaring. Our findings follow. 1) We report detailed stellar quiescent and flare X-ray properties for numerous HET/ALMA/VLBA targets, facilitating ongoing multi-wavelength analyses. 2) For numerous moderately energetic flares, we report correlations (or lack thereof) between flare energies and stellar mass/size (presence/absence of disks) for the first time. The former is attributed to the correlation between convection-driven dynamo and stellar volume, while the latter suggests the operation of solar-type flare mechanisms in PMS stars. 3) We find that most PMS stars exhibit minor long-term baseline variations, indicating the absence of intrinsic magnetic dynamo cycles or observational mitigation of cycles by saturated PMS X-rays. 4) We conclude that X-ray mega-flares are ubiquitous phenomena in PMS stars, which suggests that all protoplanetary disks and nascent planets are subject to violent high-energy emission and particle irradiation events.</description>

      <title>Quantum nature of gravity in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons on a Bose-Einstein condensate has been explored in (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 026014; https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.026014). In the previous paper, we investigated the effects of graviton while detecting a gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this work we shall explicitly calculate the decoherence due to the noise of gravitons between two momentum states of the Bose-Einstein condensate. This decoherence happens due to Bremsstrahlung from the Bose-Einstein condensates due to the effect of the noise induced by gravitons. It is also observed that the two states become entangled because of the existence of a surrounding graviton field which degrades over time via means of this gravitational Bremsstrahlung. Using this property of the Bose-Einstein condensate in a quantum gravity background, we propose an experimental test via the use of atom lasers (generated from the condensate) which would, in principle, help to detect gravitons in future generations of very advanced ultra-cold temperature experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing CP-violation in a Heavy Higgs Sector at CLIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to probe CP-violation in the heavy (pseudo)scalar sector of an extended Higgs model, in which we make simultaneous use of the $HVV$ ($V=W^\pm, Z$) and $Ht\bar{t}$ interactions of a heavy Higgs state $H$. This is possible at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) by exploiting $H$ production from Vector-Boson Fusion (VBF) and decay to $t\bar{t}$ pairs. We analyze the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the leptons coming from top and antitop quarks, that would allow one to disentangle the CP nature of such a heavy Higgs state. We also show its implications for the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with CP-violation.</description>

      <title>Axion Clouds around Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that axions can be efficiently produced via non-stationary pair plasma discharges in the polar cap region of pulsars. Here, we point out that for axion masses $10^{-9} \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-4} \, \rm eV$, a sizable fraction of the sourced axion population will be gravitationally confined to the neutron star. These axions accumulate over astrophysical timescales, thereby forming a dense `axion cloud' around the star. We argue that the existence of such a cloud, with densities reaching and potentially exceeding $\mathcal{O}(10^{22}) \, {\rm GeV \, cm^{-3}}$, is a generic expectation across a wide range of parameter space. For axion masses $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-7} \, \rm eV$, energy is primarily radiated from the axion cloud via resonant axion-photon mixing, generating a number of distinctive signatures that include: a sharp line in the radio spectrum of each pulsar (located at the axion mass, and with an order percent-level width), and transient events arising from the reconfiguration of charge densities in the magnetosphere. While a deeper understanding of the systematic uncertainties in these systems is required, our current estimates suggest that existing radio telescopes could improve sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry extended Standard Model (SM) is a well motivated framework that resolves the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and experimental observation of muon anomalous magnetic moment. We envisage the possibility of identifying the beyond Standard Model Higgs of $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ sector, non-minimally coupled to gravity, as the inflaton in the early universe, while being consistent with the $(g-2)_\mu$ data. Although the structure seems to be trivial, we observe that taking into consideration of a complete cosmological history starting from inflation through the reheating phase to late-time epoch along with existing constraints on $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model parameters leave us a small window of allowed reheating temperature. This further results into restriction of $(n_s-r)$ plane which is far severe than the one in a generic non-minimal quartic inflationary set up.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy neutral leptons through exotic Higgs decays at the ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we investigate the feasibility of detecting heavy neutral leptons ($N_d$) through exotic Higgs decays at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), specifically in the channel of $e^+ e^- \to qq~ H$ with $H\to \nu N_d \to \nu~lW \to \nu l~qq$. Analyses based on full detector simulations of the ILD are performed at the center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV for two different beam polarization schemes with a total integrated luminosity of 2 $\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$. A range of heavy neutral lepton masses between the $Z$ boson and Higgs boson masses are studied. The $2\sigma$ significance reach for the joint branching ratio of $BR(H\to\nu N_d)\cdot BR(N_d\to lW)$ is about 0.1\%, nearly independent of the heavy neutral lepton masses, while the $5\sigma$ discovery is possible at a branching ratio of $0.3\%$. Interpreting these results in terms of constraints on the mixing parameters $|\varepsilon_{id}|^2$ between SM neutrinos and the heavy neutral lepton, it is expected to have a factor of 10 improvement from current constraints.</description>

      <title>Detecting Axion Dark Matter with Black Hole Polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion, as a leading dark matter candidate, is the target of many ongoing and proposed experimental searches based on its coupling to photons. Ultralight axions that couple to photons can also cause polarization rotation of light, which the cosmic microwave background can probe. In this work, we show that a large axion field is inevitably developed around supermassive black holes due to the Bose-Einstein condensation of axions, enhancing the induced birefringence effects. Therefore, measuring the modulations of supermassive black hole imaging polarization angles is a strong probe of the axion-photon coupling due to the formation of the axion condensation (axion star) which enhances the axion field. The oscillating axion field around black holes induces polarization rotation on the black hole image, which is detectable and distinguishable from astrophysical effects on the polarization angle, as it exhibits distinctive temporal variability and frequency invariability. In this work, we perform theoretical calculations of the axion star formation rate and the corresponding enhanced axion field value near supermassive black holes. Then, we present the range of axion-photon couplings within the axion mass range $10^{-21}-10^{-16}\,\text{eV}$ that can be probed by the Event Horizon Telescope. The axion parameter space probed by black hole polarimetry will expand with improvements in sensitivity of polarization measurements and more black hole polarimetry targets with determined black hole masses.</description>

Abstract: Embedding symmetries in the architectures of deep neural networks can improve classification and network convergence in the context of jet substructure. These results hint at the existence of symmetries in jet energy depositions, such as rotational symmetry, arising from the physical features of the underlying processes. We introduce new jet observables, Jet Rotational Metrics (JRMs), which provide insights into the substructure of jets by comparing them to jets with perfect discrete rotational symmetry. We show that JRMs are formidable jet features, achieving good classification scores when used as inputs to deep neural networks. We also show that when used in combination with other jet observables, like N-subjettiness and EFPs, our features increase classification performance. The results suggest that JRMs may capture information not efficiently captured by the other observables, motivating the design of future jet observables for learning the underlying symmetries in the physical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As experiment charts new territory at the electroweak scale, the enterprise to characterise all possible theories becomes all the more necessary. In the absence of new particles, this ambitious enterprise is attainable and has led to the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) as the most general characterising framework, containing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a subspace. The characterisation of this theory space led to the dichotomy SMEFT vs. HEFT\SMEFT as the two possible realisations of symmetry breaking. The criterion to distinguish these two possibilities is non-local in field space, and phenomena which explore field space beyond the neighbourhood of the vacuum manifold are in a singular position to tell them apart. Cosmology allows for such phenomena, and this work focuses on HEFT\SMEFT, the less explored of the two options, to find that first order phase transitions with detectable gravitational wave remnants, domain wall formation and vacuum decay in the far, far distant future can take place and single out HEFT\SMEFT. Results in cosmology are put against LHC constraints, and the potential of future ground- and space-based experiments to cover parameter space is discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermal leptogenesis in the presence of helical hypermagnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major challenges in particle physics and cosmology is understanding why there is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the Universe. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is thermal leptogenesis, which involves the addition of at least two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to the standard model. Another possible explanation is baryogenesis through the hypermagnetic fields which involves the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly and helical hypermagnetic fields in the early Universe. In this paper, after reviewing the thermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly, we investigate the simplest model that combines these two scenarios and explore the parameter space for optimal results. Our results show that the combined scenario permits a specific region of parameter space that is not covered by either one separately. In fact, the minimum required mass scale of the RHN and strength of initial hypermagnetic helicity are reduced by one order of magnitude in our model. Moreover, we find that in the combined scenario, leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly can either amplify or reduce the effect of each other, i.e., the generated asymmetry, depending on the sign of the helical hypermagnetic fields. Finally, we show the surprising result that a drastic amplification can occur even when the initial abundance of RHN is its equilibrium value for leptogenesis.</description>

BHAC-QGP is based on the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes through the solution of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Like the mother code, BHAC-QGP uses Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows for a dynamic adjustment of the resolution in regions of the computational domain where a particularly high accuracy is needed. We here discuss a number of applications of BHAC-QGP to Au-Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) energies and show that the code is able to reproduce results of other simulations of these scenarios, but with much higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Weak decays of $\pmb{B_c}$ involving vector mesons in self-consistent covariant light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of weak transition form factors, semileptonic decays, and nonleptonic decays of $B_c$ meson involving pseudoscalar ($P$) and vector ($V$) meson for bottom-conserving and bottom-changing decay modes. We employ self-consistent covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM), termed as Type-II correspondence, to calculate the $B_c$ to $P(V)$ transition form factors. The Type-II correspondence in the CLF approach gives self-consistent results associated with the $B^{(i)}_j$ functions, which vanish numerically after the replacement $M^{\prime(\prime\prime)} \to M_0^{\prime(\prime\prime)}$ in traditional Type-I correspondence, and the covariance of the matrix elements is also restored. We investigate these effects on bottom-conserving $B_c$ to $P(V)$ form factors that have not yet been studied in CLFQM Type-II correspondence. In addition, we quantify the implications of self-consistency propagating to weak decays involving both bottom-conserving and bottom-changing $B_c$ transition form factors. We use two different parameterizations, the usual three-parameter function of $q^2$ and the model-independent $z$-series expansion, to establish a clear understanding of $q^2$ dependence. Using the numerical values of the form factors, we predict the branching ratios and other physical observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, polarization fractions, etc., of the semileptonic $B_c$ decays. Subsequently, we predict the branching ratios of two-body nonleptonic weak decays using the factorization hypothesis in self-consistent CLFQM. We also compare our results with those of other theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Five-body $D\to V$ Semileptonic Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main objective is to derive the decay rate for the semileptonic decays $D\to V\ell^+\nu_{\ell}\,(\ell=e,\mu)$, where $V$ represents a vector particle. In these decays, the vector particle $V$ decays into three pseudo-scalar particles. To accomplish this, we evaluate the phase-space factor for the five-body decay with a set of eight independent variables which uniquely define a point in the phase space. We further conduct a detailed investigation of the $D\to \omega\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$, where $\omega$ subsequently decays into $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$, within the Standard Model and in a general effective field theory description of the weak interactions at low energies. The outcomes of this study have potential applications in the measurement of $D\to \omega$ form factors. These measurements can be performed using data obtained from BESIII.</description>

      <title>Quasiparton distributions in massive QED2: Toward quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the couplings of axion-like particle with neutrinos at the CEPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of detecting the couplings of axion-like particle (ALP) with leptons from their loop-level impact on the ALP couplings to electroweak (EW) gauge bosons via the signal process $e^+ e^- \to \gamma \gamma {E\mkern-10.5 mu/}$ at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) and obtain prospective sensitivities to the ALP-lepton couplings. Our numerical results show that the CEPC with the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=240~(91)$ GeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=5.6~(16)$ ab$^{-1}$ might be sensitive for probing the ALP-lepton couplings in the ALP mass range from $10$ GeV to $130~(50)$ GeV, where the prospective sensitivities to the ALP-neutrino coupling $Tr(g_{a\nu\nu})/f_a$ can be as low as $0.016~(0.012)$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $0.0031~(2.8 \times 10^{-4})$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $c_{R}=0$ and $c_{R}=c_{L}$, and to the ALP-charged lepton coupling $Tr(g_{a\ell\ell})/f_a$ can be as low as $0.035~(0.07)$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $c_{L}=0$. We find that the prospective sensitivities given by the CEPC are not covered by the current and expected exclusion regions in some ALP mass intervals. The CEPC has the potential for exploring the ALP-neutrino couplings via some promising processes induced by the ALP-EW gauge boson couplings in the future.</description>

      <title>Global fit to $b \to c\tau\nu$ anomalies as of Spring 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several new experimental results of the test of lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ semi-leptonic decays were announced: the first result of $R_{D}$ from the LHCb Run 1 data, the first results of $R_{D}$ and $R_{D^\ast}$ from the LHCb Run 2 data, and the first result of $R_{D^\ast}$ from the Belle II collaboration. Including these new data, a global analysis still prefers the violation of the LFU between the tau and light leptons. A new world average of the data from the BaBar, LHCb, Belle, and Belle II collaborations is $R_{D} = 0.342 \pm 0.026$ and $R_{D^{\ast}} = 0.287 \pm 0.012$. Including this new data, we update a circumstance of the $b \to c \tau \overline\nu$ measurements and their implications for new physics (NP). Incorporating recent developments for the $B \to D^{(\ast)}$ form factors in the Standard Model (SM), we observe a $4.4 \sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction. Our updates also include; model-independent NP formulae for the related observables; and the global fittings of parameters for leptoquark scenarios as well as single NP operator scenarios. Furthermore, we show future potential to indirectly distinguish different NP scenarios with the use of the precise measurements of the polarization observables in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau \overline\nu$ at the Belle II and the high-$p_{\rm T}$ flavored-tail searches at the LHC. We also discuss an impact on the LFU violation in $\Upsilon \to l^+ l^-$.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics of Model H within the real-time fRG approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical dynamics of Model H with a conserved order parameter coupled to a transverse momentum density which describes the gas-liquid or binary-fluid transitions is investigated within the functional renormalization group approach formulated on the closed time path. According to the dynamic scaling analysis, Model H and QCD critical end point belong to the same dynamic universality class in the critical region. The higher-order correction of the transport coefficient $\bar\lambda$ and shear viscosity $\bar\eta$ arising from mode-couplings are obtained by calculating the two-point correlation functions. The flow equation of a dimensionless coupling constant for nondissipative interactions is derived to look for the fixed-point solution of the system. The scaling relation between the critical exponent of the transport coefficient and that of the shear viscosity is estimated. Finally, the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is obtained as a function of the spatial dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>The Potential Energy of Heavy Quarkonium in Flavor-Dependent Systems from a Holographic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, which incorporates information on the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility from lattice results, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the potential energy, running coupling, and dissociation time for heavy quark-antiquark pairs using gauge/gravity duality. This study encompasses various systems, including pure gluon systems, 2 flavor systems, 2+1 flavor systems, and 2+1+1 flavor systems under finite temperature and chemical potential. The results reveal that the linear component of the potential energy diminishes as the flavor increases. It is also found that our results are extremely close to the recent lattice results for 2+1 flavors at finite temperature. Moreover, we have thoroughly investigated the dissociation distance and running coupling constant of quark-antiquark pairs to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior across various flavors. Finally, we have examined real-time dynamics of quark dissociation. The findings indicate that the dissociation time of quark-antiquark pairs is dependent on temperature, chemical potential, and flavor of the systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and quantum gravity are strong reasons to extend the standard model of particle physics. A large extra dimension can be motivated by quantum gravity and can explain the small neutrino masses with new singlet states that propagate in the bulk. In such a case, a Kaluza-Klein tower of sterile neutrinos emerges. We revisit constraints on towers of sterile neutrinos that come from cosmological observables such as the effective number of noninteracting relativistic species and the dark matter density. These limits generically rule out micron-sized extra dimensions. We explore the weakening of these constraints to accommodate an extra dimension close to the micron size by assuming that the universe reheated after inflation to a low temperature. We discuss how such a possibility can be distinguished in the event of a positive signal in a cosmological observable.</description>

      <title>Proton Decay and Gauge Coupling Unification in an Extended SU(5) GUT with 45-Dimensional Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of an extended SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) that incorporates a 45-dimensional Higgs representation to address the shortcomings of the minimal SU(5) GUT, such as the inability to generate realistic fermion mass hierarchies and insufficient proton stability. By considering a hierarchical mass spectrum for the scalar components of the 45-Higgs, we demonstrate that successful gauge coupling unification (GCU) can be achieved. The color octet scalar, color triplet scalar, and color anti-triplet scalar play crucial roles in realizing GCU when their masses are significantly lighter than other components of the 45-Higgs. We focuses on the proton decay channels mediated by the exchange of the color anti-triplet scalar. Assuming that the 45-Higgs couples to all three generations of fermions, we determine the 45-Higgs Yukawa couplings with which the observed fermion mass matrices at low energies are realized. We calculate proton decay rates using the Yukawa couplings obtained from renormalization group evolutions and matching conditions at the GUT scale, thereby exploring the dependence of proton decay rates on model parameters. We find that the $p \to \nu \pi$ mode imposes the most stringent constraint on the mass of the color anti-triplet scalar $M_{S_1}$. We also study the correlations between the lower bounds on $M_{S_1}$ derived from different proton decay modes.</description>

Abstract: We provide a set of theoretical constraints on models in which the Standard Model field content is extended by vector-like fermions and in some cases also by a real scalar singlet. Our approach is based on the study of electroweak vacuum stability, perturbativity of model couplings and gauge couplings unification with the use of renormalization group equations. We show that careful analysis of these issues leads to strong constraints on the parameter space of the considered models. This, in turn, has important implications for phenomenology, as we show using examples of the double Higgs boson production, electroweak precision observables, and the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with levitated ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or ``axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</description>

Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are few codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

Abstract: The $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ $Z'$ model has emerged as a promising candidate to address the longstanding muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly. Flavor-conserving $Z'$ interactions are subject to stringent constraints from the neutrino trident process and NA64$\mu$ experiments, which limit the $Z'$ mass to $m_{Z'}&lt;40$ MeV. To circumvent these constraints, flavor-conserving $Z'$ interactions can be converted into maximal flavor-violating interactions through a discrete exchange symmetry. Maximal flavor-violating $Z'$ interactions contribute to $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$ via the neutral current, yet the parameter space for this process conflicts with the $(g-2)_\mu$ allowed regions. To resolve this conflict, we propose introducing a singly-charged scalar that mediates via charged current interactions. This scalar is anticipated to produce a negative contribution to the lepton $(g-2)_l$ while concurrently inducing the tau decay $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$. Three distinct scenarios arise from the introduction of singly-charged scalars: the $\mathcal{O}_{LL}$ operator, driven by weak singlet and triplet, and the $\mathcal{O}_{LR}$ operator, driven by weak doublet. Our analysis of the phenomenology in these three cases reveals that the tension between the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly and $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$ for large $Z'$ masses can be effectively alleviated only by the singly-charged scalars from the weak triplet, whereas the singlet and doublet scenarios fall short. Furthermore, the singly-charged scalars from the weak triplet offer an additional explanation for the electron $(g-2)_e$ anomaly. Our findings indicate that weak triplets could play a crucial role in $Z'$ models, potentially providing valuable insights for future research into $U(1)$ frameworks.</description>

      <title>Plausible constraints and inflationary production for dark photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generic constraints on dark photons are generally presented assuming they have Stueckelberg masses. These constraints are strengthened if instead the mass is due to the Higgs mechanism and the dark Higgs is light. First, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the origin of kinetic mixing $\epsilon$ and perturbativity, the strengthened constraints on $\epsilon$ cannot be arbitrarily relaxed by making the Higgs heavy. Second, we demonstrate a simple mechanism for generating dark photon dark matter after inflation, where fluctuations of a dark Higgs by stochastic misalignment can produce stable dark photons through $h\to A'A'$ decay. Third, we point out new lower bounds on $\epsilon$ in the case where the dark photon mediates thermal freeze-out of light dark matter by $s$-channel exchange, taking account of generic expectations for the size of $\epsilon$, and astrophysical upper bounds on the self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several LQCD simulations have proven that the interaction in the isoscalar channel in $DD^*$ scattering is attractive. This channel is naturally connected to the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ which is observed in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution. However, it remains an open question whether the virtual bound state found in the several LQCD simulations is actually linked to the LHCb experimental observation. In this article we perform an EFT-based analysis of the LQCD data and demostrate that a proper chiral extrapolation leads to a $T_{cc}$ pole compatible with experiment. At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\Delta E=-0.06 \left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\right) \left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>

      <title>On the effective action for scalars in a general manifold to any loop order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional methods and a derivative expansion are employed for laying out a procedure to compute the effective action to any loop order, for scalar fields parametrising an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, while maintaining explicit field-space covariance. In this process, the geometric generalization of the LSZ reduction formula is presented. These results are of use in the characterization of effective field theories for electroweak symmetry breaking and extend a geometric perspective in field space beyond one loop.</description>

      <title>Yukawa theory in non-perturbative regimes: towards confinement, exact $\beta$-function and conformal phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study possible hints towards confinement in a Z$_2$-invariant Yukawa system with massless fermions and a real scalar field in the strongly-coupled regime. Using the tools developed for studying non-perturbative physics via Jacobi elliptical functions, for a given but not unique choice of the vacuum state, we find the exact Green's function for the scalar sector so that, after integrating out the scalar degrees of freedom, we are able to recover the low-energy limit of the theory that is a fully non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. We provide an analytical result for the Renormalization Group (RG) running of the self-interaction coupling in the scalar sector and critical indexes in the strongly-coupled regime. In the fermion sector, we provide some clues towards confinement, after deriving the gap equation with the non-local NJL model, a property which is well-known to not emerge in the local limit of this model. We conclude that, for the scalar-Yukawa theory in the non-perturbative domain with our choice of the vacuum state, the fundamental fermions of the theory form bound states and cannot be observed as asymptotic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave interferometers have been recently proposed as a promising probe in searches for dark matter. These highly sensitive instruments are potentially able to detect the interactions of dark matter with the detector's hardware. In this work, we explore the possibilities of discovering topological dark matter with the LIGO detectors. We analyze domain walls consisting of dark matter passing through the Earth, leaving traces in multiple detectors simultaneously. Considering dark matter interactions with light in the interferometer, and with the beam splitter, we perform the first analysis of topological dark matter with gravitational-wave strain data. We examine whether astrophysically unexpected triggers could be explained by domain-wall passages. We find that all of the binary black hole mergers we analyze favor the binary black hole merger hypothesis rather than the domain-wall hypothesis, with the closest being GW190521. Moreover, we find that some topological dark matter signals can be caught by binary black hole searches. Finally, we find that special types of glitches in the measurement data can inevitably limit the dark matter searches for certain parameters. These results are expected to guide future searches and analyses.</description>

      <title>Low-Scale Inflationary Magnetogenesis without Baryon Isocurvature Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetogenesis is an intriguing possibility to explain the origin of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs). However, the baryon isocurvature problem has recently been pointed out, ruling out all magnetogenesis models operating above the electroweak scale. In this letter, we show that lower-scale inflationary scenarios with a Chern-Simons coupling can evade this problem. We propose concrete inflationary models whose reheating temperatures are lower than the electroweak scale and numerically compute the amount of magnetic fields generated during inflation and reheating. We find that, for lower reheating temperatures, the magnetic helicity decreases significantly. It is also possible to generate fully helical magnetic fields by modifying the inflaton potential. In both cases, the produced magnetic fields can be strong enough to explain the observed IGMFs, while avoiding the baryon isocurvature problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge-invariant quantum fields are constructed in an Abelian power-counting renormalizable gauge theory with both scalar, vector and fermionic matter content. This extends previous results already obtained for the gauge-invariant description of the Higgs mode via a propagating gauge-invariant field. The renormalization of the model is studied in the Algebraic Renormalization approach.
  The decomposition of Slavnov-Taylor identities into separately invariant sectors is analyzed.
  We also comment on some non-renormalizable extensions of the model whose 1-PI Green's functions are the flows of certain differential equations of the homogeneous Euler type, exactly resumming the dependence on a certain set of dim. 6 and dim. 8 derivative operators.
  The latter are identified uniquely by the condition that they span the mass and kinetic terms in the gauge-invariant dynamical fields.
  The construction can be extended to non-Abelian gauge groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the physics of relativistic gapless phases defined by a mixed anomaly between two generalized conserved currents. The gapless modes can be understood as Goldstone modes arising from the nonlinear realization of (generically higher-form) symmetries arising from these currents. In some cases, the anomaly cannot be reproduced by any local and unitary theory, indicating that the corresponding symmetries are impossible, in the sense that they cannot appear in a Lorentzian physical system. We consider many examples of the general construction. Most notably, we study conformal gravity from this perspective, describing the higher-form symmetries of the linear theory and showing how it can be understood in terms of anomalies. Along the way we clarify some aspects of electric-magnetic duality in linear conformal gravity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical power-law lens mass model parameters, often introducing additional empirical parameters and constraints from high resolution imagery. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) in order to constrain both lens and cosmological parameters for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the timescape model. We then generate large mock data sets to further investigate the choice of cosmology on fitting simple power-law lens models. In agreement with previous results, we find that in combination with single isothermal sphere parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\mathrm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\mathrm v0}\to0.73$ and closely matches values that best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and the cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\mathrm v0}\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for timescape fits to both timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. With larger datasets soon available, separation of cosmology and lens models must be addressed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs) is investigated in a comprehensive analysis with particular attention to the role of the nuclear equation of state. Hadronic matter is modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model is based on the neutron decay anomaly. The non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS are studied in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters, NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.</description>

      <title>"Rosenbluth" separation of the $J/\psi $ near-threshold photoproduction -- an access to the gluon Gravitational Form Factors at high $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform analysis of the near-threshold $J/\psi $ photoproduction data off the proton based on two theoretical approaches, GPD [1] and holographic [2], that represent the differential cross sections as powers of the skewness parameter with coefficients that depend only on the momentum transfer $t$. This allows to separate kinematically the corresponding coefficient functions, in much the same way as this is done for the electric and magnetic form factors using the Rosenbluth separation. We examine the independence of the extracted functions with the photon beam energy. These functions, under additional assumptions, are related to the proton's gluon Gravitational Form Factors (gGFFs). We compare the extracted functions with lattice calculations of the gGFFs in the region of $0.5&lt;|t|&lt;2$~GeV$^{2}$, where they overlap. Such analysis demonstrates the possibility of extracting some combinations of the gGFFs from the data at high $t$, complementary to the lattice calculations available in the low $t$ region. However, higher statistics are needed to more accurately check the predicted scaling behavior of the data and compare with the lattice results, thus testing and comparing the theoretical assumptions used in the GPD and holographic models.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>An $\textit{ab initio}$ strategy for taming nuclear-structure dependence of $ V_{ud} $ extractions: the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first \textit{ab initio} calculation of the nuclear-structure-dependent radiative correction $ \delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } $ to the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition, computed with the no-core shell model and chiral effective field theory. We obtain $\delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } = - 0.422 (29)_{ \mathrm{nuc} } (12)_{ n,\mathrm{el} } $ with a $1.6$-times reduction in the total uncertainty when compared to the current literature estimate based on the shell model and Fermi gas picture. This work paves the way for a precise determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed beta decays within a systematically improvable framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ decays using the Belle and Belle~II data samples, which have integrated luminosities of 980~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and 426~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, respectively. We measure the following relative branching fractions $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.48 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.03 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta)/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.11 \pm 0.01 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.08 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) $$ for the first time, where the uncertainties are statistical ($\rm stat$) and systematic ($\rm syst$). By multiplying by the branching fraction of the normalization mode, ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$, we obtain the following absolute branching fraction results $(6.9 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.5 ({\rm syst}) \pm 1.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, $(1.6 \pm 0.2 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, and $(1.2 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.1 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, for $\Xi_{c}^{0}$ decays to $\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ final states, respectively. The third errors are from the uncertainty on ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$. The asymmetry parameter for $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$ is measured to be $\alpha(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}) = -0.90\pm0.15({\rm stat})\pm0.23({\rm syst})$.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime: loops, dimensional regularization and cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalar fields in de Sitter spacetime, computed via standard perturbation theory, often exhibit secular growth characterized by time-dependent divergent terms in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing cosmic expansion. It is widely believed that loop corrections further enhance this secular growth. However, in this note, we argue that this is not necessarily the case: Loop corrections can be systematically handled using standard perturbative techniques, such as dimensional regularization, without introducing new $\ln a(t)$ terms. We focus on a canonical massless scalar field $\varphi$ with self-interactions described by a potential $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)$, and analyze correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this framework, infrared divergences can be systematically eliminated with counterterms at each order in perturbation theory, leading to loop-corrected correlation functions that are indistinguishable from their tree-level forms, with no secular growth from loops. Furthermore, adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we explore the role of cutoffs in computing loop corrections within effective field theory and identify the effective potential $\mathcal{V}_{\rm eff}(\varphi)$, which guarantees cutoff-independent observables. We conclude that when infrared comoving cutoffs are used to regularize loop integrals, time-dependent Wilsonian coefficients are necessary to maintain cutoff-free correlation functions. Neglecting this time dependence results in secular growth from loops.</description>

      <title>Towards Hypernuclei from Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing non-minimal coupling through super-horizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &lt; 1/3$ and $\xi \lesssim 1/6$ or $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Such instability causes a substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in the low and intermediate-frequency ranges that are strong enough to be detected by PLANCK and future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong lower bound on $\xi$ for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, and upper bound on the value of $\xi$ for $\wre &gt; 1/3$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \gtrsim 0.02$ for $\wre =0$, and $\lesssim 4.0$ for $\wre \geq 1/2$ for a wide range of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. Further, as one approaches $\wre$ towards $1/3$, the value of $\xi$ remains unconstrained. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a new framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy particle and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as in medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>
