      <title>The phase diagram of compressed sensing with $\ell_0$-norm regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noiseless compressive sensing is a two-steps setting that allows for undersampling a sparse signal and then reconstructing it without loss of information. The LASSO algorithm, based on $\lone$ regularization, provides an efficient and robust to address this problem, but it fails in the regime of very high compression rate. Here we present two algorithms based on $\lzero$-norm regularization instead that outperform the LASSO in terms of compression rate in the Gaussian design setting for measurement matrix. These algorithms are based on the Approximate Survey Propagation, an algorithmic family within the Approximate Message Passing class. In the large system limit, they can be rigorously tracked through State Evolution equations and it is possible to exactly predict the range compression rates for which perfect signal reconstruction is possible. We also provide a statistical physics analysis of the $\lzero$-norm noiseless compressive sensing model. We show the existence of both a replica symmetric state and a 1-step replica symmmetry broken (1RSB) state for sufficiently low $\lzero$-norm regularization. The recovery limits of our algorithms are linked to the behavior of the 1RSB solution.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna for Wireless Communications:Prototyping and Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA), which can flexibly change the position of antenna in three-dimensional (3D) continuous space, is an emerging technology for achieving full spatial performance gains. In this paper, a prototype of MA communication system with ultra-accurate movement control is presented to verify the performance gain of MA in practical environments. The prototype utilizes the feedback control to ensure that each power measurement is performed after the MA moves to a designated position. The system operates at 3.5 GHz or 27.5 GHz, where the MA moves along a one-dimensional horizontal line with a step size of 0.01{\lambda} and in a two-dimensional square region with a step size of 0.05{\lambda}, respectively, with {\lambda} denoting the signal wavelength. The scenario with mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) links is considered. Extensive experimental results are obtained with the designed prototype and compared with the simulation results, which validate the great potential of MA technology in improving wireless communication performance. For example, the maximum variation of measured power reaches over 40 dB and 23 dB at 3.5 GHz and 27.5 GHz, respectively, thanks to the flexible antenna movement. In addition, experimental results indicate that the power gain of MA system relies on the estimated path state information (PSI), including the number of paths, their delays, elevation and azimuth angles of arrival (AoAs), as well as the power ratio of each path.</description>

      <title>Enhanced BICM Receiver Metrics for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Short Block Channel Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Bit-Interleaved coded modulation metrics for joint estimation and detection in short block length channels, addressing scenarios with unknown channel state information and low training dimension density. We show that it is possible to enhance the performance and sensitivity through joint detection-estimation compared to standard receivers, especially when the channel state information is unknown and the density of the training dimensions is low. The performance analysis makes use of a full 5G transmitter and receiver chains for both Polar and LDPC coded transmissions paired with QPSK modulation scheme. We consider transmissions where reference signals are interleaved with data and both are transmitted over a small number of OFDM symbols so that near-perfect channel estimation cannot be achieved. This is particularly adapted to mini-slot transmissions for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) or for short packet random access use cases. Performance evaluation spans SIMO and SU-MIMO configurations, emphasizing the efficacy of BICM detection in realistic base station receiver scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that when the detection windows used in the metric units are on the order of four modulated symbols, the proposed receiver metrics can be used to achieve detection performance that is close to that of a coherent receiver with perfect channel state information.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Iteratively Linear Detectors in Multi-User (ELAA-)MIMO Systems with UW-SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current iterative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detectors suffer from slow convergence when the wireless channel is ill-conditioned. The ill-conditioning is mainly caused by spatial correlation between channel columns corresponding to the same user equipment, known as intra-user interference. In addition, in the emerging MIMO systems using an extremely large aperture array (ELAA), spatial non-stationarity can make the channel even more ill-conditioned. In this paper, user-wise singular value decomposition (UW-SVD) is proposed to accelerate the convergence of iterative MIMO detectors. Its basic principle is to perform SVD on each user's sub-channel matrix to eliminate intra-user interference. Then, the MIMO signal model is effectively transformed into an equivalent signal (e-signal) model, comprising an e-channel matrix and an e-signal vector. Existing iterative algorithms can be used to recover the e-signal vector, which undergoes post-processing to obtain the signal vector. It is proven that the e-channel matrix is better conditioned than the original MIMO channel for spatially correlated (ELAA-)MIMO channels. This implies that UW-SVD can accelerate current iterative algorithms, which is confirmed by our simulation results. Specifically, it can speed up convergence by up to 10 times in both uncoded and coded systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Broadband Backscatter Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication offers a promising solution to connect massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices with low cost and high energy efficiency. Nevertheless, its inherently passive nature limits transmission reliability, thereby hindering improvements in communication range and data rate. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a bistatic broadband backscatter communication (BBBC) system, which equips the backscatter device (BD) with multiple antennas. In the proposed BBBC system, a radio frequency (RF) source directs a sinusoidal signal to the BD, facilitating single-carrier block transmission at the BD. Meanwhile, without requiring channel state information (CSI), cyclic delay diversity (CDD) is employed at the multi-antenna BD to enhance transmission reliability through additional cyclically delayed backscattered signals. We also propose a receiver design that includes preprocessing of the time-domain received signal, pilot-based parameter estimation, and frequency-domain equalization, enabling low-complexity detection of the backscattered signal. Leveraging the matched filter bound (MFB), we analyze the achievable diversity gains in terms of outage probability. Our analysis reveals that spatial diversity is achievable under general Rayleigh fading conditions, and both frequency and spatial diversity are attainable in scenarios where the forward link experiences a line-of-sight (LoS) channel. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed BBBC system. As the number of BD antennas increases, our results show that the proposed scheme not only enhances array gain but also improves diversity order, significantly reducing both outage probability and bit error rate (BER). Consequently, it outperforms conventional schemes that yield only minor gains.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Position Optimization for Physical-Layer Security via Discrete Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antennas (FAs) and mobile antennas (MAs) are innovative technologies in wireless communications that are able to proactively improve channel conditions by dynamically adjusting the transmit/receive antenna positions within a given spatial region. In this paper, we investigate an MA-enhanced multiple-input single-output (MISO) secure communication system, aiming to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the positions of multiple MAs. Instead of continuously searching for the optimal MA positions as in prior works, we propose to discretize the transmit region into multiple sampling points, thereby converting the continuous antenna position optimization into a discrete sampling point selection problem. However, this point selection problem is combinatory and thus difficult to be optimally solved. To tackle this challenge, we ingeniously transform this combinatory problem into a recursive path selection problem in graph theory and propose a partial enumeration algorithm to obtain its optimal solution without the need for high-complexity exhaustive search. To further reduce the complexity, a linear-time sequential update algorithm is also proposed to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms yield much higher secrecy rates as compared to the conventional FPA and other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Index Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The index coding problem is concerned with broadcasting encoded information to a collection of receivers in a way that enables each receiver to discover its required data based on its side information, which comprises the data required by some of the others. Given the side information map, represented by a graph in the symmetric case and by a digraph otherwise, the goal is to devise a coding scheme of minimum broadcast length.
  We present a general method for developing efficient algorithms for approximating the index coding rate for prescribed families of instances. As applications, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms that approximate the index coding rate of graphs and digraphs on $n$ vertices to within factors of $O(n/\log^2 n)$ and $O(n/\log n)$ respectively. This improves on the approximation factors of $O(n/\log n)$ for graphs and $O(n \cdot \log \log n/\log n)$ for digraphs achieved by Blasiak, Kleinberg, and Lubetzky (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2013). For the family of quasi-line graphs, we exhibit a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the index coding rate to within a factor of $2$. This improves on the approximation factor of $O(n^{2/3})$ achieved by Arbabjolfaei and Kim (ISIT, 2016) for graphs on $n$ vertices taken from certain sub-families of quasi-line graphs.
  Our approach is applicable for approximating a variety of additional graph and digraph quantities to within the same approximation factors. Specifically, it captures every graph quantity sandwiched between the independence number and the clique cover number and every digraph quantity sandwiched between the maximum size of an acyclic induced sub-digraph and the directed clique cover number.</description>

      <title>More basis reduction for linear codes: backward reduction, BKZ, slide reduction, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand on recent exciting work of Debris-Alazard, Ducas, and van Woerden [Transactions on Information Theory, 2022], which introduced the notion of basis reduction for codes, in analogy with the extremely successful paradigm of basis reduction for lattices. We generalize DDvW's LLL algorithm and size-reduction algorithm from codes over $\mathbb{F}_2$ to codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$, and we further develop the theory of proper bases. We then show how to instantiate for codes the BKZ and slide-reduction algorithms, which are the two most important generalizations of the LLL algorithm for lattices.
  Perhaps most importantly, we show a new and very efficient basis-reduction algorithm for codes, called full backward reduction. This algorithm is quite specific to codes and seems to have no analogue in the lattice setting. We prove that this algorithm finds vectors as short as LLL does in the worst case (i.e., within the Griesmer bound) and does so in less time. We also provide both heuristic and empirical evidence that it outperforms LLL in practice, and we give a variant of the algorithm that provably outperforms LLL (in some sense) for random codes.
  Finally, we explore the promise and limitations of basis reduction for codes. In particular, we show upper and lower bounds on how ``good'' of a basis a code can have, and we show two additional illustrative algorithms that demonstrate some of the promise and the limitations of basis reduction for codes.</description>

Abstract: We present shuffle coding, a general method for optimal compression of sequences of unordered objects using bits-back coding. Data structures that can be compressed using shuffle coding include multisets, graphs, hypergraphs, and others. We release an implementation that can easily be adapted to different data types and statistical models, and demonstrate that our implementation achieves state-of-the-art compression rates on a range of graph datasets including molecular data.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a generalization of the recently proposed quantum Tanner codes by Leverrier and Z\'emor, which contains a construction of asymptotically good quantum LDPC codes. Quantum Tanner codes have so far been constructed equivalently from groups, Cayley graphs, or square complexes constructed from groups. We show how to enlarge this to group actions on finite sets, Schreier graphs, and a family of square complexes which is the largest possible in a certain sense. Furthermore, we discuss how the proposed generalization opens up the possibility of finding other families of asymptotically good quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the smoothed empirical Wasserstein distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an empirical measure $\mathbb{P}_n$ induced by $n$ iid samples from a $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$ and let $\gamma = N(0,\sigma^2 I_d)$ be the isotropic Gaussian measure. We study the speed of convergence of the smoothed Wasserstein distance $W_2(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma, \mathbb{P}*\gamma) = n^{-\alpha + o(1)}$ with $*$ being the convolution of measures. For $K&lt;\sigma$ and in any dimension $d\ge 1$ we show that $\alpha = {1\over2}$. For $K&gt;\sigma$ in dimension $d=1$ we show that the rate is slower and is given by $\alpha = {(\sigma^2 + K^2)^2\over 4 (\sigma^4 + K^4)} &lt; 1/2$. This resolves several open problems in [GGNWP20], and in particular precisely identifies the amount of smoothing $\sigma$ needed to obtain a parametric rate. In addition, for any $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$, we also establish that $D_{KL}(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma \|\mathbb{P}*\gamma)$ has rate $O(1/n)$ for $K&lt;\sigma$ but only slows down to $O({(\log n)^{d+1}\over n})$ for $K&gt;\sigma$. The surprising difference of the behavior of $W_2^2$ and KL implies the failure of $T_{2}$-transportation inequality when $\sigma &lt; K$. Consequently, it follows that for $K&gt;\sigma$ the log-Sobolev inequality (LSI) for the Gaussian mixture $\mathbb{P} * N(0, \sigma^{2})$ cannot hold. This closes an open problem in [WW+16], who established the LSI under the condition $K&lt;\sigma$ and asked if their bound can be improved.</description>

Abstract: The growing reliance on digital twins across various industries and domains brings with it semantic interoperability challenges. Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</description>

Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every m-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Such a state spans a pure [[n,0,m+1]] quantum error correcting code (QECC). Starting with an m-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we construct codeword stabilized (CWS) codes that are pure [[n,k,m+1]] QECCs. We propose measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and recovery of logical qubits from code states. Our proposed protocols support sequential encoding and partial recovery of logical qubits, which can be useful for quantum memory applications.</description>

Abstract: Use-dependent bias is a phenomenon in human sensorimotor behavior whereby movements become biased towards previously repeated actions. Despite being well-documented, the reason why this phenomenon occurs is not yet clearly understood. Here, we propose that use-dependent biases can be understood as a rational strategy for movement under limitations on the capacity to process sensory information to guide motor output. We adopt an information-theoretic approach to characterize sensorimotor information processing and determine how behavior should be optimized given limitations to this capacity. We show that this theory naturally predicts the existence of use-dependent biases. Our framework also generates two further predictions. The first prediction relates to handedness. The dominant hand is associated with enhanced dexterity and reduced movement variability compared to the non-dominant hand, which we propose relates to a greater capacity for information processing in regions that control movement of the dominant hand. Consequently, the dominant hand should exhibit smaller use-dependent biases compared to the non-dominant hand. The second prediction relates to how use-dependent biases are affected by movement speed. When moving faster, it is more challenging to correct for initial movement errors online during the movement. This should exacerbate costs associated with initial directional error and, according to our theory, reduce the extent of use-dependent biases compared to slower movements, and vice versa. We show that these two empirical predictions, the handedness effect and the speed-dependent effect, are confirmed by experimental data.</description>
