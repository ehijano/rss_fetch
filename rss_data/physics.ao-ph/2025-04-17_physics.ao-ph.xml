      <title>Enhancing Deterministic Freezing Level Predictions in the Northern Sierra Nevada Through Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the freezing level (FZL) is essential for hydrometeorological forecasting systems and precipitation phase estimation, and it influences runoff generation and reservoir management decisions. In this study, we develop a deep learning based postprocessing framework using the Unet convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to refine the FZL forecasts from the West Weather Research and Forecasting (West-WRF) model. The proposed framework leverages reforecast data from West WRF and FZL estimates from the California Nevada River Forecast Center (CNRFC) to train a deterministic Unet model over the Yuba-Feather watershed, a hydrologically critical basin in northern California. We introduce two variants of our model, Unet-Log and Unet-GMM, which utilize the logarithm of the hyperbolic cosine of Error and Gaussian Mixture Model loss functions, respectively, to enhance FZL forecast accuracy beyond an RMSE based benchmark. Results indicate that the Unet based postprocessing framework significantly improves FZL forecast skill across diverse atmospheric conditions and complex topography. Compared to the raw West-WRF output, our model achieves reductions in RMSE of up to 25% and increases the forecast observation correlation by about 10% over the Yuba-Feather watershed. Furthermore, it effectively captures the spatiotemporal variability of the FZL across different elevations, mitigating systematic biases inherent in the West-WRF model. This novel deep learning based postprocessing approach demonstrates a promising pathway for integrating machine learning into hydrometeorological forecasting and decision support within the Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations (FIRO) framework.</description>

      <title>Global Patterns of Extreme Temperature Teleconnections Using Climate Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events, rare yet profoundly impactful, are often accompanied by severe conditions. Increasing global temperatures are poised to exacerbate these events, resulting in greater human casualties, economic losses, and ecological destruction. Complex global climate interactions, known as teleconnections, can lead to widespread repercussions triggered by localized extreme weather. Understanding these teleconnection patterns is crucial for weather forecasting, enhancing safety, and advancing climate science. Here, we employ climate network analysis to uncover teleconnection patterns associated with extreme temperature fluctuations, including both extreme warming and cooling events occurring on a daily basis. Our study results demonstrate that the distances of significant teleconnections initially conform to a power-law decay, signifying a decline in connectivity with distance. However, this power-law decay tendency breaks beyond a certain threshold distance, suggesting the existence of long-distance connections. Additionally, we uncover a greater prevalence of long-distance connectivity among extreme cooling events compared to extreme warming events. The global pattern of teleconnections is, in part, driven by the mechanism of Rossby waves, which serve as a rapid conduit for inducing correlated fluctuations in both pressure and temperature. These results enhance our understanding of the multiscale nature of climate teleconnections and hold significant implications for improving weather forecasting and assessing climate risks in a warming world.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Super-Resolution Data Assimilation Using Conditional Variational Autoencoders with Estimating Background Covariances via Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03351v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a theory of unsupervised super-resolution data assimilation (SRDA) using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). We derive an evidence lower bound for unsupervised learning, showing that our theory is an extension of a traditional data assimilation (DA) method, namely the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) formalism. In contrast to 3D-Var, our theory exploits the non-locality of super-resolution (SR) to learn background covariances without explicitly imposing them for assimilating distant observations. For linear SR, SR operators serve as background error covariance matrices,whereas for nonlinear SR, error backpropagation through SR neural networks induces covariance structures in inference. SRDA can naturally be realized with CVAEs because the loss function for CVAEs is generally an evidence lower bound. By incorporating the SR neural network into the CVAE, the encoder estimates the high-resolution (HR) analysis from HR observations and low-resolution forecasts. The decoder acts as the observation operator by reconstructing the HR observations from the estimated HR analysis. The effectiveness of SRDA was evaluated through numerical experiments using an idealized barotropic ocean jet system. Compared to inference with an ensemble Kalman filter, SRDA demonstrated superior accuracy in HR inference. SRDA was also computationally efficient because it does not require HR numerical integration or ensemble calculations. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for integrating SR and DA, which will stimulate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) system has served as a useful simplified model for understanding geophysical fluid phenomena. The fact that it is based on only one prognostic variable -- potential vorticity (PV) -- is a simplification that has facilitated much theoretical understanding. However, although QG captures many geophysical turbulence phenomena, it misses important features that occur in shallow water systems at finite Rossby numbers, even those that are ``balanced''. For example, QG does not capture the emergent vorticity asymmetry or the finite divergence of the velocity fields. Here we present a next-order-in-Rossby extension of QG in the single-layer and multi-layer shallow water context: SWQG$^{+1}$. A freely decaying simulation shows that SWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity found in simulations of the shallow water model in the same setting. We also extend the model to the multi-layer configuration. Simulations of nonlinear evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet in SWQG$^{+1}$ show that it can capture vorticity asymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts.</description>

      <title>Interpreting seasonal and interannual Hadley cell descending edge migrations via the cell-mean Rossby number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The poleward extent of Earth's zonal-mean Hadley cells varies across seasons and years, which would be nice to capture in a simple theory. A plausible, albeit diagnostic, candidate from Hill et al (2022) combines the conventional two-layer, quasi-geostrophic, baroclinic instability-based framework with a less conventional assumption: that each cell's upper-branch zonal winds are suitably captured by a single, cell-wide Rossby number, with meridional variations in the local Rossby number neglected. We test this theory against ERA5 reanalysis data, finding that it captures both seasonal and interannual variations in the Hadley cell zonal winds and poleward extent fairly well. For the seasonal cycle of the NH cell poleward edge only, this requires empirically lagging the prediction by one month, for reasons unclear to us. In all cases, the bulk Rossby number value that yields the most accurate zonal wind fields is approximately equal to the actual, diagnosed cell-mean value. Variations in these cell-mean Rossby numbers, in turn, predominantly drive variations in each cell's poleward extent. All other terms matter much less -- including the subtropical static stability, which, by increasing under global warming, is generally considered the predominant driver of future Hadley cell expansion. These results argue for developing a predictive theory for the cell-mean Rossby number and for diagnosing its role in climate model projections of future Hadley cell expansion.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Nino Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <title>RAIN: Reinforcement Algorithms for Improving Numerical Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with idealised climate models to address key parameterisation challenges in climate science. Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics. Overall, this work represents an important first step towards leveraging RL to enhance climate model accuracy, critical for improving climate understanding and predictions.
