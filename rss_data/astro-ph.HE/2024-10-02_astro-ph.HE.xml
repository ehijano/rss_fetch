      <title>Where has all the $r$-process gone? Timescales for GRB-Kilonovae to Enrich their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) mergers are currently the only observed source of r-process production in the Universe. Yet, it is unclear how much r-process mass from these mergers is incorporated into star-forming gas to enrich stars. This is crucial to consider as all other r-process mass estimates in the Universe beyond Earth are based on stellar r-process abundances. Here, we explore the extent to which merger location and host galaxy properties affect the incorporation of r-process elements into star-forming gas, and quantify an ``enrichment" timescale to account for this process. To put this timescale in context, we analyze a population of 12 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with probable associations to r-process kilonovae (GRB-KNe) and 74 short GRBs without claimed KNe, including new non-parametric star formation histories for the GRB-KN hosts. We find enrichment timescales for this sample are between ~7 Myr-1.6 Gyr, suggesting that environmental enrichment is delayed from NS merger occurrence. Moreover, we find a correlation between the amount of environmental enrichment from a single event and increasing host specific star formation rate (sSFR), and little correlation with stellar mass and GRB galactocentric offset. Environments with low sSFRs (&lt;10^-10.5 yr^-1), which comprise 18% of short GRB hosts and the host of GW170817, will have little to no capacity for enrichment. Our results indicate that not all r-process from NS mergers enriches star-forming gas, and instead some is lost to the CGM or IGM. Future studies should consider these losses to understand the total contribution from NS mergers to the Universe's r-process budget.</description>

      <title>Accessing universal relations of binary neutron star waveforms in massive scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the quasi-universal relations connecting tidal deformability with gravitational waveform characteristics and/or properties of individual neutron stars that were proposed in the literature within general relativity would be influenced in the massive Damour-Esposito-Farese-type scalar-tensor gravity. For this purpose, we systematically perform numerical relativity simulations of ~120 binary neutron star mergers with varying scalar coupling constants. Although only three neutron-star equations of state are adopted, a clear breach of universality can be observed in the data sets. In addition to presenting difficulties in constructing quasi-universal relations in alternative gravity theories, we also briefly compare the impacts of non-general-relativity physics on the waveform features and those due to the first order or cross-over quantum chromodynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Probing fermionic asymmetric dark matter cores using global neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68% (95%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.36}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2% level, the constraints on lower bound on the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.5}$ and $10^{-7.29}$ at the 68% and 95% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain ADM in some scenarios and that the presence of ADM in neutron star cores is as equally consistent with current data as the absence of ADM.</description>

      <title>Fermi-GBM Team Analysis on The Ravasio Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prompt spectra of gamma-ray bursts are known to follow broadband continuum behavior over decades in energy. GRB 221009A, given the moniker the brightest of all time (BOAT), is the brightest gamma-ray burst identified in half a century of observations, and was first identified by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). On behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team, Lesage et al. (2023) described the initial GBM analysis. Ravasio et al. (2024) report the identification of a spectral line in part of the prompt emission of this burst, which they describe as evolving over 80 s from $\sim$12 MeV to 6 MeV. We report a GBM Team analysis on the Ravasio Line: 1) We cannot identify an instrumental effect that could have produced this signal, and 2) our method of calculating the statistical significance of the line shows it easily exceeds the 5$\sigma$ discovery threshold. We additionally comment on the claim of the line beginning at earlier time intervals, up to 37 MeV, as reported in Zhang et al. (2024). We find that it is reasonable to utilize these measurements for characterization of the line evolution, with caution. We encourage theoretical studies exploring this newly discovered gamma-ray burst spectral feature, unless any rigorous alternative explanation unrelated to the emission from GRB 221009A is identified.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations of Precessing Tilted Super-Eddington Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a tilted super-Eddington accretion disk around the spinning black hole (BH). The disk, that tilts and twists as it approaches the BH, precesses while maintaining its shape. The gas is mainly ejected around the rotation axis of the outer part of the disk rather than around the spin axis of the BH. The disk precession changes the ejection direction of the gas with time. The radiation energy is also released in approximately the same direction as the outflow, so the precession is expected to cause a quasi-periodic time-variation of the observed luminosity. The timescale of the precession is about $10$ s for the 10 solar mass BH and for the radial extent of the disk of several tens of gravitational radii. This timescale is consistent with the frequency of the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation ($0.01-1$ Hz) observed in some ultraluminous X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Cross Correlating the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background with Cosmic Large-Scale Structure from DESI: Implications for Astrophysics and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) is a diffuse gamma-ray emission arising from numerous extragalactic sources below the detection threshold and is an important component of the gamma-ray sky. Studying the UGRB is crucial for understanding high-energy astrophysical processes in the universe and for probing fundamental physics, such as the nature of dark matter. In this work, we forecast the cross-correlation between the UGRB and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. First, we study the expected astrophysical contributions to the UGRB and their cross-correlation with DESI spectroscopic galaxies. Our calculations show that the cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio is expected to be significant, with the highest value predicted to be 20.6 for DESI luminous red galaxies due to a higher predicted overlap in the redshift distribution with the UGRB. We consider two science cases that the UGRB-spectroscopic galaxies cross-correlation can be applied to: 1) measuring the UGRB flux as a function of redshift, achieving a precision of 10\% in some redshift bins, and 2) searching for annihilating dark matter potentially up to a mass of about 300~GeV, three times higher than the currently strongest constraints. This work underscores the importance of cross correlating the UGRB with cosmic large-scale structure tracers and highlights the multiwavelength approaches to advancing our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent model of shock-heated plasma in non-equilibrium states for direct parameter constraints from X-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations of shock-heated plasmas, such as those found in supernova remnants, often exhibit features of temperature and ionization non-equilibrium. For accurate interpretation of these observations, proper calculations of the equilibration processes are essential. Here, we present a self-consistent model of thermal X-ray emission from shock-heated plasmas that accounts for both temperature and ionization non-equilibrium conditions. For a given pair of shock velocity and initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio, the temporal evolution of the temperature and ionization state of each element was calculated by simultaneously solving the relaxation processes of temperature and ionization. The resulting thermal X-ray spectrum was synthesized by combining our model with the AtomDB spectral code. Comparison between our model and the \texttt{nei} model, a constant-temperature non-equilibrium ionization model available in the XSPEC software package, reveals a 30\% underestimation of the ionization timescale in the \texttt{nei} model. We implemented our model in XSPEC to directly constrain the shock wave properties, such as the shock velocity and collisionless electron heating efficiency, from the thermal X-ray emission from postshock plasmas. We applied this model to archival Chandra data of the supernova remnant N132D, providing a constraint on the shock velocity of $\sim 800~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, in agreement with previous optical studies.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron polarization of a hybrid distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons in GRB prompt emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron polarization of relativistic nonthermal electrons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been widely studied. However, recent numerical simulations of relativistic shocks and magnetic reconnection have found that a more realistic electron distribution consists of a power-law component plus a thermal component, which requires observational validation. In this paper, we investigate synchrotron polarization using a hybrid energy distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons within a globally toroidal magnetic field in GRB prompt emission. Our results show that, compared to the case of solely non-thermal electrons, the synchrotron polarization degrees (PDs) in these hybrid electrons can vary widely depending on different parameters and that the PD decreases progressively with frequency in the $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, and optical bands. The time-averaged PD spectrum displays a significant bump in the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands with the PDs higher than $\sim60\%$ if the thermal peak energy of electrons is much smaller than the conjunctive energy of electrons between the thermal and non-thermal distribution. The high synchrotron PD ($\gtrsim 60\%$) in the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, which generally can not be produced by solely non-thermal electrons with typical power-law slopes, can be achieved by the hybrid electrons and primarily originates from the exponential decay part of the thermal component. Moreover, this model can roughly explain the PDs and spectral properties of some GRBs, where GRB 110301A with a high PD ($70_{-22}^{+22} \%$) may be potential evidence for the existence of relativistic thermal electrons.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Mysterious Origin of FRB 20121102A with Machine-learning Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio waves from the Universe. Even though more than 50 physical models have been proposed, the origin and physical mechanism of FRB emissions are still unknown. The classification of FRBs is one of the primary approaches to understanding their mechanisms, but previous studies classified conventionally using only a few observational parameters, such as fluence and duration, which might be incomplete. To overcome this problem, we use an unsupervised machine-learning model, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to handle seven parameters simultaneously, including amplitude, linear temporal drift, time duration, central frequency, bandwidth, scaled energy, and fluence.
  We test the method for homogeneous 977 sub-bursts of FRB 20121102A detected by the Arecibo telescope. Our machine-learning analysis identified five distinct clusters, suggesting the possible existence of multiple different physical mechanisms responsible for the observed FRBs from the FRB 20121102A source. The geometry of the emission region and the propagation effect of FRB signals could also make such distinct clusters.
  This research will be a benchmark for future FRB classifications when dedicated radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) or Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) discover more FRBs than before.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Propagation of Shocks in the Equatorial Ring of SN 1987A Over Decades with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby SN 1987A offers a unique opportunity to investigate the complex shock interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar medium. We track the evolution of the optical hotspots within the Equatorial Ring (ER) by analyzing 33 Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations between 1994 and 2022. By fitting the ER with an elliptical model, we determine its inclination to be $ 42.85 \pm 0.50^{\circ}$ with its major axis oriented $ -6.24 \pm 0.31^{\circ}$ from the west. We identify 26 distinct hotspots across the ER, with additional ones emerging over time, particularly on the west side. The hotspots initially show high velocities ranging from $390$ to $1660 \ \rm km \ s^{-1}$, followed by a deceleration phase around day $\sim 8000$. Subsequent velocities vary from $40$ to $660 \ \rm km \ s^{-1}$. The light curves of the hotspots reach maxima between 7000 and 9000 days, suggesting a connection with the deceleration. Many spots are spatially resolved and show elongation perpendicular to the direction of motion, indicative of a short cooling time. To explain these results, we propose that each hotspot comprises dense substructures embedded in less dense gas. The initial velocities are then phase velocities, the break occurs when the blast wave leaves the ER, while the late velocities reflect the propagation of radiative shocks in the dense substructures. We estimate that the dense substructures have a volumetric filling factor of $\sim0.3 \left( n_{\mathrm{e}}/10^{6}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \right)^{-2} \%$ and a total mass of $\sim0.24 \left(n_{\mathrm{e}}/10^{6}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \right)^{-1}\times10^{-2}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$.</description>

      <title>GTC optical/NIR upper limits and NICER X-ray analysis of SGR J1935+2154 for the outburst in 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 has undergone another outburst since 2022 October 10. We present the results of searching for an optical/NIR counterpart of SGR J1935+2154 before and during this outburst. No counterpart was detected at the magnetar's position in ${r'}$ and ${z'}$ bands, providing stringent upper limits of $r'\gtrsim 28.65$ and $z'\gtrsim 26.27$. Using archival X-ray data from NICER, we investigated the properties of the bursts and the spectral evolution of persistent emission. The burst flux $F$ showed a power-law distribution of $N\propto F^{-0.76\pm0.10}$ for flux $\gtrsim 2.6\times 10^{-9}\rm{\ erg\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$, while the temperature and radius followed a lognormal distribution with $kT=1.63^{+0.73}_{-0.50}\ \rm{keV}$ and $R_{\rm bb}=4.35_{-1.35}^{+1.95}\ \rm{km}$, respectively. The persistent flux evolution experienced a quick decay and an enhancement $\sim 27$ days after the BAT trigger. Using the near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray emission, together with the GTC optical/NIR upper limits, we discussed the origin of the NIR emission from the magnetar based on the fallback disk model and magnetosphere model. We found that either model cannot be ruled out with currently available data. Further mid-infrared observations are needed to find out the mechanism for producing the NIR emission from SGR J1935+2154.</description>

      <title>Optical and X-ray Studies of the Be/X-ray Binary IGR J06074+2205</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from X-ray and optical analysis of the Be/X-ray binary IGR~J06074+2205, focusing on before, during, and after the X-ray outbursts in October and December 2023. The properties of the neutron star in the binary are investigated using NICER and NuSTAR observations during the X-ray outbursts. The pulse profiles across a broad energy range, are found to be strongly dependent on luminosity and energy, revealing the complex nature of the emitting region. An absorbed power-law can describe each NICER spectrum in the 1-7 keV band. The 3-79 keV NuSTAR spectrum can be well-described by a negative and positive power-law with an exponential cut-off model. Utilizing the MAXI/GSC long-term light curve, we estimate the probable orbital period to be 80 or 80/n (n=2,3,4) days. We investigate the evolution of the circumstellar disc around the Be star by using optical spectroscopic observations of the system between 2022 and 2024. We observe variable H$\alpha$ and FeII emission lines with an increase in equivalent width, indicating the presence of a dynamic circumstellar disc. A distinct variation in the V/R value for H$\alpha$ and FeII lines is also observed. The appearance of additional emission lines, such as HeI (5875.72 \AA), HeI (6678 \AA), and HeI (7065 \AA), during the post-outburst observation in February 2024 suggests the growing of a larger or denser circumstellar disc. The disc continues to grow without any noticeable mass loss, even during the 2023 X-ray outbursts, which may lead to a future giant X-ray outburst.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>

Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

      <title>Blue large-amplitude pulsators formed from the merger of low-mass white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered group of hot stars pulsating in radial modes. Their origin needs to be explained, and several scenarios for their formation have already been proposed. We investigate whether BLAPs can originate as the product of a merger of two low-mass white dwarfs (WDs) and estimate how many BLAPs can be formed in this evolutionary channel. We used the MESA code to model the merger of three different double extremely low-mass (DELM) WDs and the subsequent evolution of the merger product. We also performed a population synthesis of Galactic DELM WDs using the COSMIC code. We find that BLAPs can be formed from DELM WDs provided that the total mass of the system ranges between 0.32 and 0.7 M$_\odot$. BLAPs born in this scenario either do not have any thermonuclear fusion at all or show off-centre He burning. The final product evolves to hot subdwarfs and eventually finishes its evolution either as a cooling He WD or a hybrid He/CO WD. The merger products become BLAPs only a few thousand years after coalescence, and it takes them 20 to 70 thousand years to pass the BLAP region. We found the instability of the fundamental radial mode to be in fair agreement with observations, but we also observed instability of the radial first overtone. From the population synthesis, we found that up to a few hundred BLAPs born in this scenario can exist at present in the Galaxy. Given the estimated number of BLAPs formed in the studied DELM WD merger scenario, there is a good chance to observe BLAPs that originated through this scenario. Since strong magnetic fields can be generated during mergers, this scenario could lead to the formation of magnetic BLAPs. This fits well with the discovery of two likely magnetic BLAPs whose pulsations can be explained in terms of the oblique rotator model.</description>

      <title>Fisher Forecast of Finite-Size Effects with Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Fisher information theory to forecast the bounds on the finite-size effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Infrared Space Antenna (LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number $H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.</description>

      <title>Galactic center G objects as dust-enshrouded stars near the supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we revisit the model of a dust-enshrouded star orbiting a low-luminosity galactic nucleus (Zajacek et al. 2014, 2016, 2017). Although it is quite challenging for dust to survive in hot X-ray-emitting plasma surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we now have an observational evidence that compact dusty objects or ``G'' objects can approach the SMBH in the Galactic center (Sgr A*) on the scale of a few 1000 gravitational radii. Since there are about ten G objects in the Galactic center, it is more likely that they are dust-enshrouded stars whose gaseous-dusty envelopes are stable within the corresponding tidal (Hill) radii of the order of a few astronomical units. Such a length-scale is consistent with their infrared broad-band spectral energy distributions. Broad emission lines, in particular Br-gamma recombination line, can be interpreted to arise within the accretion stream from the circumstellar envelopes forming a compact disc that is truncated by the stellar magnetic field. Alternatively, they could also be associated with circumstellar accretion-disc outflows as well as the material within a denser bow shock ahead of the star. In comparison with the line origin in the photoionized envelopes that can generally be tidally stretched, the scenario involving the circumstellar accretion-disc inflow or outflow can ensure that the line luminosity is rather stable, except for the viewing-angle effects. We speculate about the origin of dust-enshrouded stars that could be young stellar objects or binary-merger products.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Weak AGNs from Super-Eddington Accretion onto Infant Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Closures for Neutrino Moment Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method for calculating the transport of neutrino flavor in simulations is to use angular moments of the neutrino one-body reduced density matrix, i.e., `quantum moments'. As with any moment-based radiation transport method, a closure is needed if the infinite tower of moment evolution equations is truncated. We derive a general parameterization of a quantum closure and the limits the parameters must satisfy in order for the closure to be physical. We then derive from multi-angle calculations the evolution of the closure parameters in two test cases which we then progressively insert into a moment evolution code and show how the parameters affect the moment results until the full multi-angle results are reproduced. This parameterization paves the way to setting prescriptions for genuine quantum closures adapted to neutrino transport in a range of situations.</description>

      <title>Precision orbital dynamics from interstellar scintillation arcs for PSR J0437-4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.12757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity scintillations of radio pulsars are known to originate from interference between waves scattered by the electron density irregularities of interstellar plasma, often leading to parabolic arcs in the two-dimensional power spectrum of the recorded dynamic spectrum. The degree of arc curvature depends on the distance to the scattering plasma and its transverse velocity with respect to the line-of-sight. We report the observation of annual and orbital variations in the curvature of scintillation arcs over a period of 16 years for the bright millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. These variations are the signature of the relative transverse motions of the Earth, pulsar, and scattering medium, which we model to obtain precise measurements of parameters of the pulsar's binary orbit and the scattering medium itself. We observe two clear scintillation arcs in most of our $&gt;$5000 observations and we show that they originate from scattering by thin screens located at distances $D_1 = 89.8 \pm 0.4$ pc and $D_2 = 124 \pm 3$ pc from Earth. The best-fit scattering model we derive for the brightest arc yields the pulsar's orbital inclination angle $i = 137.1 \pm 0.3^\circ$, and longitude of ascending node, $\Omega=206.3\pm0.4^\circ$. Using scintillation arcs for precise astrometry and orbital dynamics can be superior to modelling variations in the diffractive scintillation timescale, because the arc curvature is independent of variations in the level of turbulence of interstellar plasma. This technique can be used in combination with pulsar timing to determine the full three-dimensional orbital geometries of binary pulsars, and provides parameters essential for testing theories of gravity and constraining neutron star masses.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars: Oscillations and precessions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The four characteristic oscillation frequencies of accretion flows are, in addition to the Keplerian orbital frequency, often discussed in the context of the time variability of the black hole and neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). These are namely the frequencies of the axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations, and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the periastron (radial) and Lense-Thirring (vertical) precessions. In this context, we investigate the effect of the quadrupole moment of a slowly rotating NS and provide complete formulae for calculating these oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their convenient approximations. Simple formulae corresponding to the geodesic limit of a slender torus (and test particle motion) and the limit of a marginally overflowing torus (torus exhibiting a critical cusp) are presented, and furthermore, more general approximate formulae are included to allow calculations for arbitrarily thick tori. We provide the Wolfram Mathematica code used for our calculations together with C++ and PYTHON codes for calculations of the frequencies. Our formulae can be used for various calculations describing the astrophysical signatures of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state. For instance, we demonstrate that, even for a given fixed number of free parameters, a model accounting for fluid flow precession better matches the frequencies of twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations observed in NS LMXBs than a model using geodesic precession.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 1 - 12 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of 9 off-nuclear persistent radio sources (PRSs) in nearby (z &lt; 0.055) dwarf galaxies, along with high-resolution European very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) Network (EVN) observations for one of them at 1.7GHz. We explore the plausibility that these PRSs are associated with fast radio burst (FRB) sources by examining their properties, physical sizes, host-normalized offsets, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), radio luminosities, and light curves, and compare them to those of the PRSs associated with FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B, two known active galactic nuclei (AGN), and one likely AGN in our sample with comparable data, as well as other radio transients exhibiting characteristics analogous to FRB-PRSs. We identify a single source in our sample, J1136+2643, as the most promising FRB- PRS, based on its compact physical size and host-normalized offset. We further identify two sources, J0019+1507 and J0909+5955, with physical sizes comparable to FRB-PRSs, but which exhibit large offsets and flat spectral indices potentially indicative of a background AGN origin. We test the viability of neutron star wind nebulae and hypernebulae models for J1136+2643, and find that the physical size, luminosity, and SED of J1136+2643 are broadly consistent with these models. Finally, we discuss the alternative interpretation that the radio sources are instead powered by accreting massive black holes and outline future prospects and follow-up observations for differentiating between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>New physics as a possible explanation for the Amaterasu particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Telescope Array experiment has recently reported the most energetic event detected in the hybrid technique era, with a reconstructed energy of 240 EeV, which has been named ``Amaterasu'' after the Shinto deity. Its origin is intriguing since no powerful enough candidate sources are located within the region consistent with its propagation horizon and arrival direction. In this work, we investigate the possibility of describing its origin in a scenario of new physics, specifically under a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) assumption. The kinematics of UHECR propagation under a phenomenological LIV approach is investigated. The total mean free path for a particle with Amaterasu's energy increases from a few Mpc to hundreds of Mpc for $-\delta_{\rm{had},0} &gt; 10^{-22}$, expanding significantly the region from which it could have originated. A combined fit of the spectrum and composition data of Telescope Array under different LIV assumptions was also performed. The data is best fitted with some level of LIV both with and without Amaterasu. Robustness with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory is investigated by exploring an intermediate composition scenario. Similar improvements in the description of the data with LIV are found for that. New physics in the form of LIV could, thus, provide a plausible and robust explanation for the Amaterasu particle.</description>

      <title>Residual eccentricity as a systematic uncertainty on the formation channels of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolving the formation channel(s) of merging binary black holes is a key goal in gravitational-wave astronomy. The orbital eccentricity is believed to be a precious tracer of the underlying formation pathway, but is largely dissipated during the usually long inspiral between black hole formation and merger. Most gravitational-wave sources are thus expected to enter the sensitivity windows of current detectors on configurations that are compatible with quasi-circular orbits. In this paper, we investigate the impact of "negligible" residual eccentricity -- lower than currently detectable by LIGO/Virgo -- on our ability to infer the formation history of binary black holes, focusing in particular on their spin orientations. We trace the evolution of both observed and synthetic gravitational-wave events backward in time, while resampling their residual eccentricities to values that are below the detectability threshold. Eccentricities in-band as low as $\sim 10^{-4}$ can lead to significant biases when reconstructing the spin directions, especially in the case of loud, highly precessing systems. Residual eccentricity thus act like a systematic uncertainty for our astrophysical inference. As a mitigation strategy, one can marginalize the posterior distribution over the residual eccentricity using astrophysical predictions.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied luminosity (~7.6x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Relativistic Stripped Envelope Type Ic-BL Supernova at z = 2.83 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) and its host galaxy (JADES-GS+53.13533-27.81457) at $z = 2.83$. This SN (named SN 2023adta) was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Program. Follow-up observations with JWST/NIRSpec provided a spectroscopic redshift of $z = 2.83$ and the classification as a SN Ic-BL. The light curve of SN 2023adta matches well with other stripped envelope supernovae and we find a high peak luminosity, $M_V = -19.0 \pm 0.2$ mag, based on the distribution of best-fit SNe. The broad absorption features in its spectrum are consistent with other SNe Ic-BL 1-3 weeks after peak brightness. We measure a Ca II NIR triplet expansion velocity of $29{,}000 \pm 2{,}000$ km s$^{-1}$. The host galaxy of SN 2023adta is irregular, and modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates a metallicity of $Z = 0.35^{+0.16}_{-0.08} Z_{\odot}$. This environment is consistent with the population of low-$z$ SNe Ic-BL which prefer lower metallicities relative to other stripped envelope supernovae, and track long duration $\gamma$-ray burst (LGRB) environments. We do not identify any GRBs that are coincident with SN 2023adta. Given the rarity of SNe Ic-BL in the local universe, the detection of a SN Ic-BL at $z = 2.83$ could indicate that their rates are enhanced at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Systematic Collapse of the Accretion Disc Across the Supermassive Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of the accretion flow onto supermassive black holes (SMBH) is not well understood. Standard disc models match to zeroth order in predicting substantial energy dissipation within optically-thick material producing a characteristic strong blue/UV continuum. However they fail at reproducing more detailed comparisons to the observed spectral shapes along with their observed variability. Based on stellar mass black holes within our galaxy, accretion discs should undergo a transition into an X-ray hot, radiatively inefficient flow, below a (mass scaled) luminosity of $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$. While this has been seen in limited samples of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a few rare changing-look AGN, it is not at all clear whether this transition is present in the wider AGN population across cosmic time. A key issue is the difficulty in disentangling a change in spectral state from increased dust obscuration and/or host galaxy contamination, effectively drowning out the AGN emission. Here we use the new eROSITA eFEDS Survey to identify unobscured AGN from their X-ray emission, matched to excellent optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam; allowing the subtraction of the host galaxy contamination. The resulting, uncontaminated, AGN spectra reveal a smooth transition from a strongly disc dominated state in bright AGN, to the collapse of the disc into an inefficient X-ray plasma in the low luminosity AGN, with the transition occurring at $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$; revealing fundamental aspects of accretion physics in AGN.</description>

      <title>Search for the Hawking radiation of primordial black holes: prospective sensitivity of LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), more generally, BHs, undergo evaporation and, in principle, will end their lives in bursts of very high-energy gamma rays. The notable aspect of the PBHs with an initial mass of $\sim10^{14}$ g is that they are expected to end their lives today. In this work, we assess the potential sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) in detecting the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that LHAASO is capable of probing for PBH bursts within a proximity of $\sim0.1$ pc from the Sun, measuring a local burst rate density of $\sim$ 1200 (or 700)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with $99\%$ confidence during a 3-year (or 5-year) observational campaign. This level of sensitivity surpasses the most rigorous observational constraint provided by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) by an order of magnitude. Additionally, we propose data analysis strategies for LHAASO to optimize the search for PBHs and reach its potential detection limits.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV gamma-ray emission from SPT-CL J2012-5649 with six years of DAMPE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for gamma-ray emission from the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 in the energy range from 3 GeV to 1 TeV using the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) telescope. For our analysis, we use three different templates: point source, radial disk, and radial Gaussian. We do not detect a signal with significance $&gt;3\sigma$ for any of these templates at any location within $R_{200}$ of the cluster center. We obtain 95\% C.L. upper limit on the energy flux ranging between $\sim 10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4} \rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ depending on the energy range. These upper limits are consistent with a previously reported non-zero flux detected by Fermi-LAT at $6\sigma$ significance. This work represents the first proof of principle search for gamma-ray emission from a single galaxy cluster using DAMPE data.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of circular polarization in giant pulses and fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some giant pulses and fast radio bursts exhibit notable circular polarization, which remains unexplained and carries significant implications for their emission mechanisms. In this study, we identify multiple nanoshot pairs uniformly spaced by approximately 21 $\mu$s within a giant pulse emitted by the Crab pulsar. Among these pairs, a subset displays left-hand and right-hand circular polarization in two distinct nanoshots. We propose that the occurrence of such nanoshot pairs with dual circular polarizations arises from the fragmentation of a linearly-polarized nanoshot along the magnetic field lines under the extreme Faraday effect, leveraging highly-asymmetrical pair plasma and the ultra-intense field of nanoshots. The asymmetry in pair plasmas is likely linked to discharge activities in pulsars. Moreover, the intense field of nanoshots induces cyclotron resonance within the magnetosphere, effectively slowing down the propagation velocity of the circularly polarized mode. Our findings suggest that Crab giant pulses composing nanoshots originate in its polar cap region and escape the magnetosphere along the polar magnetic field. This mechanism can also elucidate the origin of circular polarization in some fast radio bursts and thus lends support to their magnetospheric origin.</description>
