      <title>Machine-learned RG-improved gauge actions and classically perfect gradient flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting continuum properties of quantum field theories from discretized spacetime is challenging due to lattice artifacts. Renormalization-group (RG)-improved lattice actions can preserve continuum properties, but are in general difficult to parameterize. Machine learning (ML) with gauge-equivariant convolutional neural networks provides a way to efficiently describe such actions. We test a machine-learned RG-improved lattice gauge action, the classically perfect fixed-point (FP) action, for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory through Monte Carlo simulations. We establish that the gradient flow of the FP action is free of tree-level discretization effects to all orders in the lattice spacing, making it classically perfect. This allows us to test the quality of improvement of the FP action, without introducing additional artifacts. We find that discretization effects in gradient-flow observables are highly suppressed and less than 1% up to lattice spacings of 0.14 fm, allowing continuum physics to be extracted from coarse lattices. The quality of improvement achieved motivates the use of the FP action in future gauge theory studies. The advantages of ML-based parameterizations also highlight the possibility of realizing quantum perfect actions in lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Electroweak form factors of baryons in dense nuclear matter</title>

Abstract: There are evidences that the properties of the hadrons are modified in a nuclear medium. Information about the medium modifications of the internal structure of the hadrons are fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter and high energy processes including heavy-ion and nucleus-nucleus collisions. At the moment, however, the empirical information about the medium modifications of the hadrons is limited, therefore, theoretical studies are essential for the progress in the field. In the present work we review theoretical studies of the electromagnetic and axial form factors of octet baryons in symmetric nuclear matter. The calculations are based on a model that takes into account the degrees of freedom revealed on experimental studies of the low and intermediate square transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks and meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. The formalism combines a covariant constituent quark model, developed for the free space (vacuum) with the quark-meson coupling model for the extension to the nuclear medium. We conclude that the nuclear medium modifies the baryon properties differently according to the flavor content of the baryons and the medium density. The effects of the medium increase with the density, and are stronger (quenched or enhanced) for light baryons than for heavy baryons. In particular, the in-medium neutrino-nucleon and antineutrino-nucleon cross sections are reduced compared to the values in free space. The proposed formalism can be extended to densities above the normal nuclear density and applied to neutrino-hyperon and antineutrino-hyperon scattering in dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs: generative machine learning applications for lattice QCD matrix elements at short distance and large momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations share a defining challenge by requiring a small finite range of spatial separation $z$ between quark/gluon bilinears for controllable power corrections in the perturbative QCD factorization, and a large hadron boost $p_z$ for a successful determination of collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at $z\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \to \infty$, thereby minimizing possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF. We also expose the bias and problems with underestimating uncertainties associated with the use of model-dependent and overly constrained functional forms, such as $x^\alpha(1-x)^\beta$ and its variants to extract PDFs from the lattice data. We propose the use of generative machine learning algorithms to mitigate these issues and present our determination of the polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>A proposal for removing $\pi N$-state contamination from the nucleon induced pseudoscalar form factor in lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: In the PACS10 project, the PACS collaboration has generated three sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\;{\rm fm})^4$ and three different lattice spacings. The isovector nucleon form factors had been already calculated by using two sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations. In our strategy, the smearing parameters of the nucleon interpolation operator were highly optimized to eliminate as much as possible the contribution of excited states in the nucleon two-point function. This strategy was quite successful in calculations of the electric ($G_E$), magnetic ($G_M$) and axial-vector ($F_A$) form factors, while the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) and pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors remained strongly affected by residual contamination of $\pi N$-state contribution. In this work, we propose a simple method to remove the $\pi N$-state contamination from the $F_P$ form factor, and then evaluate the induced pseudoscalar charge $g_P^\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{\pi NN}$ from existing data in a new analysis. Applying this method to the $G_P$ form factor is also considered with a help of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Pion Electroproduction and Weak Production from a Nucleon</title>

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in QCD influence nucleon structure and interactions, with pion production serving as a key probe of chiral dynamics. In this study, we present a lattice QCD calculation of multipole amplitudes at threshold, related to both pion electroproduction and weak production from a nucleon, using two gauge ensembles near the physical pion mass. We develop a technique for spin projection and construct multiple operators for analyzing the generalized eigenvalue problem in both the nucleon-pion system in the center-of-mass frame and the nucleon system with nonzero momentum. The numerical lattice results are then compared with those extracted from experimental data and predicted by low-energy theorems incorporating one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations for the hadronic VVA correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive two types of dispersion relations for the hadronic vector-vector-axial-vector (VVA) correlator: one in generic three-point kinematics with fixed photon virtualities, the second in the kinematic limit of one soft photon. The VVA correlator enters in the electroweak contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and it also emerges as the leading term in the operator-product expansion for hadronic light-by-light scattering in the limit of two large photon momenta. Previously, this correlator was only described in terms of hadronic models. Our new dispersive treatments are in analogy to the established and the newly proposed dispersive approaches to hadronic light-by-light. The VVA correlator allows us to investigate the relation between the two types of dispersion relations in a simpler example and to elucidate the reshuffling of different hadronic contributions in this comparison. As a byproduct, we reduce the theoretical uncertainties on the first-family VVA contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment by combining the dispersive representation with both asymptotic and low-energy constraints.</description>
