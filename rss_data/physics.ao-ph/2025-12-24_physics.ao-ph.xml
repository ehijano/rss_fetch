      <title>Even Small Companies Can Save Lives by Reducing Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global warming is often framed in broad planetary numbers such as the 1.5 C and 2 C warming thresholds, creating the false impression that individual corporations efforts to reduce emissions are meaningless in the absence of collective action. This perspective causes companies to reduce ambition towards voluntarily cutting emissions, as they believe their pollution has negligible impacts on its own. Reframing the issue to focus on the life-saving potential of individual corporate actions empowers companies to act and holds them accountable for inaction. Here, we show the results from an innovative modeling technique which calculates the avoided deaths from sustainability efforts for 3,084 companies spanning a range of sizes and sectors. From the reported emissions and planned emissions reductions, we create scenarios for 2020-2049 with and without the pledged emissions cuts and calculate the resulting warming from 2020-2100 using a climate emulator. We then use temperatures from these scenarios to calculate the deaths resulting from warming by using mortality damage functions. We find that more than 97% of these companies stand to save at least one life by following through with emissions reduction plans. Additionally, if all 3,084 companies follow through with their emissions reduction plans, over 4.4 million temperature-related deaths can be avoided.</description>

      <title>Before We Inject: Assessing the Impact of Silica-Based Aerosols on Stratospheric Chemistry via a Kinetic Model Informed by Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed as a geoengineering strategy to mitigate global warming by increasing Earth's albedo. Silica-based materials, such as diamond-doped silica aerogels, have shown promising optical properties, but their impact on stratospheric chemistry, ozone one in particular, remains largely unknown. Here, we present first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the heterogeneous reaction between hydrogen chloride ($\mathrm{HCl}$) and chlorine nitrate ($\mathrm{ClONO_2}$), two main reservoirs of stratospheric chlorine and nitrogen species, on a dry, hydroxylated $\alpha$-quartz silica interface. Our results reveal a barrierless reaction pathway toward the formation of chlorine gas ($\mathrm{Cl}_2$), a major contributor to stratospheric ozone loss. We design a heterogeneous kinetic model informed by our MD simulation and available experimental data: despite the barrierless formation of $\mathrm{Cl_2}$, the higher surface affinities and partial pressures of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$ and $\mathrm{HCl}$ compared to those of $\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ result in a negligible reaction probability, $\gamma_\mathrm{ClONO_2}$, upon chlorine nitrate collision with the silica surface. Since $\gamma_\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ enters as a proportionality constant in the definition of the heterogeneous reaction rate, our kinetic model indicates that the injection of silica-based aerosols may have only a limited impact on stratospheric ozone depletion driven by $\mathrm{HCl}$ and $\mathrm{ClONO_2}$ chemistry. At the same time, our findings also underscore the scarcity of experimental data, the need of better theoretical frameworks for the inclusion of MD results into kinetic models, and the urgency for further experimental validations of silica-based SAI technologies before their deployment in climate intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bayesian Optimization for the Automatic Tuning of Lorenz-96 as a Surrogate Climate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-inspired heuristic for automatically tuning the Lorenz-96 model -- a simple proxy to describe atmospheric dynamics, yet exhibiting chaotic behavior. Building on the history matching framework by Lguensat et al. (2023), we fully automate the tuning process with a new convergence criterion and propose replacing classical Gaussian process emulators with quantum counterparts. We benchmark three quantum kernel architectures, distinguished by their quantum feature map circuits. A dimensionality argument implies, in principle, an increased expressivity of the quantum kernels over their classical competitors. For each kernel type, we perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization of our tuning algorithm. We confirm the validity of a quantum-inspired approach based on statevector simulation by numerically demonstrating the superiority of two studied quantum kernels over the canonical classical RBF kernel. Finally, we discuss the pathway towards real quantum hardware, mainly driven by a transition to shot-based simulations and evaluating quantum kernels via randomized measurements, which can mitigate the effect of gate errors. The very low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, together with a minimal number of trainable circuit parameters, make our method particularly NISQ-friendly.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heatwave Intensification over the Indian Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a warming world, heatwaves over India have become intense and are causing severe health impacts. Studies have identified the presence of amplified Rossby waves and their association with the intensification of heatwaves. Earlier studies have identified two dominant modes of temperature variability in India and their possible role in the development of dry (mode 1) and moist (mode 2) heatwaves. These modes are associated with midlatitude Rossby waves intruding over the Indian region. However the role of regional forcing and the teleconnection behind the intensification of the heatwaves over India is missing. The present study has analyzed the dynamical mechanisms for the regional intensification of the circulation features associated with the dominant moist heatwave mode (mode 2). Considering the predominant barotropic nature of the observed circulation features of the mode, a simple barotropic vorticity equation model forced with extratropical and regional vorticity sources is used to understand the intensification of the heat waves. It was found that a wave response initiated by a cyclonic vorticity over the Bay of Bengal superimposes with the mid-latitude anticyclonic vorticity generated Rossby waves intruding over India. This superimposition results in the amplification and persistence of the anticyclonic vorticity phase over the Northwest Indian region, leading to the intensification of circulation. It was also found that the barotropically forced intensified circulation leads to the intensification of the heat stress. Under a climate change scenario, different circulation regimes, characterized by zonal stationary wave number and jet speed, which can favor the intensification are also identified.</description>

      <title>Targeted Calibration to Adjust Stability Biases in Complex Dynamical System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of complex dynamical systems like the Earth's climate often involve large numbers of uncertain parameters. Comprehensive exploration of the parameter space is typically prohibitive due to excessive computational costs, and systematic gradient-based parameter optimization is not feasible because such models are typically not differentiable. This is especially problematic in cases where the models describe highly nonlinear and possibly abrupt dynamics, where sensitivity to parameter changes is high. Components of Earth's climate system, such as the North Atlantic Overturning Circulation or the polar ice sheets, are at risk of undergoing critical transitions in response to anthropogenic climate change. Concerns have been raised that these Earth system components are too stable in state-of-the-art models. Here, we introduce a method for efficient, systematic, and objective calibration of dynamical complex system models, targeted at adjusting system stability. Given a number of physical or observational constraints, our method moves the system in a direction where the system loses or gains stability, guided by indicators of critical slowing down. In contrast to a brute force approach, where the computational cost exponentially increases with the number of parameters, our method scales polynomially and thus evades the curse of dimensionality. We successfully apply our method to a conceptual double-fold bifurcation model and a physically plausible reduced-order model of the global ocean circulation. Our method can efficiently adjust stability biases in a range of complex system models and help reveal potentially hidden instabilities and resulting state transitions in such models. These results have important implications, e.g., for Earth system models and ongoing efforts to improve their representation of key multistable Earth system components.</description>
