      <title>STCRank: Spatio-temporal Collaborative Ranking for Interactive Recommender System at Kuaishou E-shop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a popular e-commerce platform, Kuaishou E-shop provides precise personalized product recommendations to tens of millions of users every day. To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth. The proposed system has been already deployed at Kuaishou E-shop since 2025.6.</description>

      <title>Development of Ontological Knowledge Bases by Leveraging Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontological Knowledge Bases (OKBs) play a vital role in structuring domain-specific knowledge and serve as a foundation for effective knowledge management systems. However, their traditional manual development poses significant challenges related to scalability, consistency, and adaptability. Recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for automating and enhancing OKB development. This paper introduces a structured, iterative methodology leveraging LLMs to optimize knowledge acquisition, automate ontology artifact generation, and enable continuous refinement cycles. We demonstrate this approach through a detailed case study focused on developing a user context profile ontology within the vehicle sales domain. Key contributions include significantly accelerated ontology construction processes, improved ontological consistency, effective bias mitigation, and enhanced transparency in the ontology engineering process. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of integrating LLMs into ontology development, notably improving scalability, integration capabilities, and overall efficiency in knowledge management systems.</description>

      <title>iTIMO: An LLM-empowered Synthesis Dataset for Travel Itinerary Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing itinerary modification is crucial for enhancing the travel experience as it is a frequent requirement during traveling. However, existing research mainly focuses on fixed itinerary planning, leaving modification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we formally define the itinerary modification task and introduce iTIMO, a dataset specifically tailored for this purpose. We identify the lack of {\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this task and propose a general pipeline to overcome it. This pipeline frames the generation of such data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real world itineraries using three atomic editing operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on iTIMO, revealing the limitations of current LLMs and lead to several valuable directions for future research. Dataset and corresponding code are available at https://github.com/zelo2/iTIMO.</description>

      <title>RoutIR: Fast Serving of Retrieval Pipelines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval models are key components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which generate search queries, process the documents returned, and generate a response. RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we introduce RoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIR can be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the-fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking). The API automatically performs asynchronous query batching and caches results by default. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are already supported by the package, RoutIR is also easily expandable by implementing the Engine abstract class. The package is open-sourced and publicly available on GitHub: http://github.com/hltcoe/routir.</description>

      <title>Introducing Axlerod: An LLM-based Chatbot for Assisting Independent Insurance Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The insurance industry is undergoing a paradigm shift through the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly in the realm of intelligent conversational agents. Chatbots have evolved into sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of automating complex workflows, including policy recommendation and claims triage, while simultaneously enabling dynamic, context-aware user engagement. This paper presents the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of Axlerod, an AI-powered conversational interface designed to improve the operational efficiency of independent insurance agents. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and domain-specific knowledge integration, Axlerod demonstrates robust capabilities in parsing user intent, accessing structured policy databases, and delivering real-time, contextually relevant responses. Experimental results underscore Axlerod's effectiveness, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.18% in policy retrieval tasks while reducing the average search time by 2.42 seconds. This work contributes to the growing body of research on enterprise-grade AI applications in insurtech, with a particular focus on agent-assistive rather than consumer-facing architectures.</description>

      <title>SciNets: Graph-Constrained Multi-Hop Reasoning for Scientific Literature Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain scientific synthesis requires connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented literature, a capability that remains challenging for both retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models. While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.</description>

      <title>Clinical Document Metadata Extraction: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical document metadata, such as document type, structure, author role, medical specialty, and encounter setting, is essential for accurate interpretation of information captured in clinical documents. However, vast documentation heterogeneity and drift over time challenge harmonization of document metadata. Automated extraction methods have emerged to coalesce metadata from disparate practices into target schema. This scoping review aims to catalog research on clinical document metadata extraction, identify methodological trends and applications, and highlight gaps. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to identify articles that perform clinical document metadata extraction. We initially found and screened 266 articles published between January 2011 and August 2025, then comprehensively reviewed 67 we deemed relevant to our study. Among the articles included, 45 were methodological, 17 used document metadata as features in a downstream application, and 5 analyzed document metadata composition. We observe myriad purposes for methodological study and application types. Available labelled public data remains sparse except for structural section datasets. Methods for extracting document metadata have progressed from largely rule-based and traditional machine learning with ample feature engineering to transformer-based architectures with minimal feature engineering. The emergence of large language models has enabled broader exploration of generalizability across tasks and datasets, allowing the possibility of advanced clinical text processing systems. We anticipate that research will continue to expand into richer document metadata representations and integrate further into clinical applications and workflows.</description>

      <title>Continuum Memory Architectures for Long-Horizon LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>In-Browser Agents for Search Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental tension exists between the demand for sophisticated AI assistance in web search and the need for user data privacy. Current centralized models require users to transmit sensitive browsing data to external services, which limits user control. In this paper, we present a browser extension that provides a viable in-browser alternative. We introduce a hybrid architecture that functions entirely on the client side, combining two components: (1) an adaptive probabilistic model that learns a user's behavioral policy from direct feedback, and (2) a Small Language Model (SLM), running in the browser, which is grounded by the probabilistic model to generate context-aware suggestions. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a three-week longitudinal user study with 18 participants. Our results show that this privacy-preserving approach is highly effective at adapting to individual user behavior, leading to measurably improved search efficiency. This work demonstrates that sophisticated AI assistance is achievable without compromising user privacy or data control.</description>

      <title>From SERPs to Agents: A Platform for Comparative Studies of Information Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diversification of information access systems, from RAG to autonomous agents, creates a critical need for comparative user studies. However, the technical overhead to deploy and manage these distinct systems is a major barrier. We present UXLab, an open-source system for web-based user studies that addresses this challenge. Its core is a web-based dashboard enabling the complete, no-code configuration of complex experimental designs. Researchers can visually manage the full study, from recruitment to comparing backends like traditional search, vector databases, and LLMs. We demonstrate UXLab's value via a micro case study comparing user behavior with RAG versus an autonomous agent. UXLab allows researchers to focus on experimental design and analysis, supporting future multi-modal interaction research.</description>

      <title>FaTRQ: Tiered Residual Quantization for LLM Vector Search in Far-Memory-Aware ANNS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.</description>

      <title>Efficient Content-based Recommendation Model Training via Noise-aware Coreset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

      <description>arXiv:2601.10161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AWED-FiNER, an open-source ecosystem designed to bridge the gap in Fine-grained Named Entity Recognition (FgNER) for 36 global languages spoken by more than 6.6 billion people. While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate general Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they often struggle with low-resource languages and fine-grained NLP tasks. AWED-FiNER provides a collection of agentic toolkits, web applications, and several state-of-the-art expert models that provides FgNER solutions across 36 languages. The agentic tools enable to route multilingual text to specialized expert models and fetch FgNER annotations within seconds. The web-based platforms provide ready-to-use FgNER annotation service for non-technical users. Moreover, the collection of language specific extremely small sized open-source state-of-the-art expert models facilitate offline deployment in resource contraint scenerios including edge devices. AWED-FiNER covers languages spoken by over 6.6 billion people, including a specific focus on vulnerable languages such as Bodo, Manipuri, Bishnupriya, and Mizo. The resources can be accessed here: Agentic Tool (https://github.com/PrachuryyaKaushik/AWED-FiNER), Web Application (https://hf.co/spaces/prachuryyaIITG/AWED-FiNER), and 49 Expert Detector Models (https://hf.co/collections/prachuryyaIITG/awed-finer).</description>

In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>From Single to Multi-Agent Reasoning: Advancing GeneGPT for Genomics QA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comprehending genomic information is essential for biomedical research, yet extracting data from complex distributed databases remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for genomic Question Answering (QA) but face limitations due to restricted access to domain-specific databases. GeneGPT is the current state-of-the-art system that enhances LLMs by utilizing specialized API calls, though it is constrained by rigid API dependencies and limited adaptability. We replicate GeneGPT and propose GenomAgent, a multi-agent framework that efficiently coordinates specialized agents for complex genomics queries. Evaluated on nine tasks from the GeneTuring benchmark, GenomAgent outperforms GeneGPT by 12% on average, and its flexible architecture extends beyond genomics to various scientific domains needing expert knowledge extraction.</description>

      <title>Grounding Agent Memory in Contextual Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.
  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with generating reliable outputs due to outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models address this by enhancing LLMs with external knowledge, but often fail to personalize the retrieval process. This paper introduces PersonaRAG, a novel framework incorporating user-centric agents to adapt retrieval and generation based on real-time user data and interactions. Evaluated across various question answering datasets, PersonaRAG demonstrates superiority over baseline models, providing tailored answers to user needs. The results suggest promising directions for user-adapted information retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>FiCo-ITR: bridging fine-grained and coarse-grained image-text retrieval for comparative performance analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of Image-Text Retrieval (ITR), recent advancements have leveraged large-scale Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) for Fine-Grained (FG) instance-level retrieval, achieving high accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity. For Coarse-Grained (CG) category-level retrieval, prominent approaches employ Cross-Modal Hashing (CMH) to prioritise efficiency, albeit at the cost of retrieval performance. Due to differences in methodologies, FG and CG models are rarely compared directly within evaluations in the literature, resulting in a lack of empirical data quantifying the retrieval performance-efficiency tradeoffs between the two. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the \texttt{FiCo-ITR} library, which standardises evaluation methodologies for both FG and CG models, facilitating direct comparisons. We conduct empirical evaluations of representative models from both subfields, analysing precision, recall, and computational complexity across varying data scales. Our findings offer new insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs between recent representative FG and CG models, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. These findings provide the foundation necessary to make more informed decisions regarding model selection for specific retrieval tasks and highlight avenues for future research into hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both FG and CG approaches.</description>

      <title>CASPER: Concept-integrated Sparse Representation for Scientific Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying relevant research concepts is crucial for effective scientific search. However, primary sparse retrieval methods often lack concept-aware representations. To address this, we propose CASPER, a sparse retrieval model for scientific search that utilizes both tokens and keyphrases as representation units (i.e., dimensions in the sparse embedding space). This enables CASPER to represent queries and documents via research concepts and match them at both granular and conceptual levels. Furthermore, we construct training data by leveraging abundant scholarly references (including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and co-citations), which capture how research concepts are expressed in diverse settings. Empirically, CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines across eight scientific retrieval benchmarks. We also explore the effectiveness-efficiency trade-off via representation pruning and demonstrate CASPER's interpretability by showing that it can serve as an effective and efficient keyphrase generation model.</description>

      <title>COINS: SemantiC Ids Enhanced COLd Item RepresentatioN for Click-through Rate Prediction in E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of modern search and recommendation platforms, insufficient collaborative information of cold-start items exacerbates the Matthew effect of existing platform items, challenging platform diversity and becoming a longstanding issue. Existing methods align items' side content with collaborative information to transfer collaborative signals from high-popularity items to cold-start items. However, these methods fail to account for the asymmetry between collaboration and content, nor the fine-grained differences among items. To address these issues, we propose COINS, an item representation enhancement approach based on fused alignment of semantic IDs. Specifically, we use RQ-OPQ encoding to quantize item content and collaborative information, followed by a two-step alignment: RQ encoding transfers shared collaborative signals across items, while OPQ encoding learns differentiated information of items. Comprehensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate superiority of COINS, and rigorous online A/B tests confirm statistically significant improvements: item CTR +1.66%, buyers +1.57%, and order volume +2.17%.</description>

      <title>CoRECT: A Framework for Evaluating Embedding Compression Techniques at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense retrieval systems have proven to be effective across various benchmarks, but require substantial memory to store large search indices. Recent advances in embedding compression show that index sizes can be greatly reduced with minimal loss in ranking quality. However, existing studies often overlook the role of corpus complexity -- a critical factor, as recent work shows that both corpus size and document length strongly affect dense retrieval performance. In this paper, we introduce CoRECT (Controlled Retrieval Evaluation of Compression Techniques), a framework for large-scale evaluation of embedding compression methods, supported by a newly curated dataset collection. To demonstrate its utility, we benchmark eight representative types of compression methods. Notably, we show that non-learned compression achieves substantial index size reduction, even on up to 100M passages, with statistically insignificant performance loss. However, selecting the optimal compression method remains challenging, as performance varies across models. Such variability highlights the necessity of CoRECT to enable consistent comparison and informed selection of compression methods. All code, data, and results are available on GitHub and HuggingFace.</description>

      <title>Bid Farewell to Seesaw: Towards Accurate Long-tail Session-based Recommendation via Dual Constraints of Hybrid Intents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict anonymous users' next interaction based on their interaction sessions. In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a "see-saw" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \textbf{HID} (\textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{I}ntent-based \textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional "see-saw" into "win-win" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \textit{diversity} and \textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision transformers in vision-language models typically use the same amount of compute for every image, regardless of whether it is simple or complex. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive computation approach that enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both the early-exit and full-depth paths. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.959 with human labelling whilst delivering 4.4x faster complexity prediction. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% faster image encoding while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.</description>

Abstract: Distributed multi-agent systems (DMAS) based on large language models (LLMs) enable collaborative intelligence while preserving data privacy. However, systematic evaluations of long-term memory under network constraints are limited. This study introduces a flexible testbed to compare mem0, a vector-based memory framework, and Graphiti, a graph-based knowledge graph, using the LoCoMo long-context benchmark. Experiments were conducted under unconstrained and constrained network conditions, measuring computational, financial, and accuracy metrics. Results indicate mem0 significantly outperforms Graphiti in efficiency, featuring faster loading times, lower resource consumption, and minimal network overhead. Crucially, accuracy differences were not statistically significant. Applying a statistical Pareto efficiency framework, mem0 is identified as the optimal choice, balancing cost and accuracy in DMAS.</description>

      <title>RMBRec: Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation faces a critical challenge in practice: auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, carts) are often noisy, weakly correlated, or semantically misaligned with the target behavior (e.g., purchase), which leads to biased preference learning and suboptimal performance. While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.
  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations. For reproducibility, our code is available at https://github.com/miaomiao-cai2/RMBRec/.</description>

      <title>Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM.</description>

      <title>MM-BRIGHT: A Multi-Task Multimodal Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of text-based queries where keyword or semantic matching is usually sufficient. Many real-world queries contain multimodal elements, particularly, images such as diagrams, charts, and screenshots that require intensive reasoning to identify relevant documents. To address this gap, we introduce MM-BRIGHT, the first multimodal benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our dataset consists of 2,803 real-world queries spanning 29 diverse technical domains, with four tasks of increasing complexity: text-to-text, multimodal-to-text, multimodal-to-image, and multimodal-to-multimodal retrieval. Extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle across all tasks: BM25 achieves only 8.5 nDCG@10 on text-only retrieval, while the best multimodal model Nomic-Vision reaches just 27.6 nDCG@10 on multimodal-to-text retrieval actually underperforming the best text-only model (DiVeR: 32.2). These results highlight substantial headroom and position MM-BRIGHT as a testbed for next-generation retrieval models that better integrate visual reasoning. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/mm-bright/MM-BRIGHT. See also our official website: https://mm-bright.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: The ACM Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) is a venue that welcomes and compares systems that support the exploration of lifelog data, and in particular the retrieval of specific information, through an interactive competition format. This paper reviews the recent advances in interactive lifelog retrieval as demonstrated at the ACM LSC from 2022 to 2024. Through a detailed comparative analysis, we highlight key improvements across three main retrieval tasks: known-item search, question answering, and ad-hoc search. Our analysis identifies trends such as the widespread adoption of embedding-based retrieval methods (e.g., CLIP, BLIP), increased integration of large language models (LLMs) for conversational retrieval, and continued innovation in multimodal and collaborative search interfaces. We further discuss how specific retrieval techniques and user interface (UI) designs have impacted system performance, emphasizing the importance of balancing retrieval complexity with usability. Our findings indicate that embedding-driven approaches combined with LLMs show promise for lifelog retrieval systems. Likewise, improving UI design can enhance usability and efficiency. Additionally, we recommend reconsidering multi-instance system evaluations within the expert track to better manage variability in user familiarity and configuration effectiveness.</description>
