      <title>Nanophotonic oscillators for laser conversion beyond an octave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many uses of lasers place the highest importance on access to specific wavelength bands. For example, mobilizing optical-atomic clocks for a leap in sensing requires compact lasers at frequencies spread across the visible and near infrared. Integrated photonics enables high-performance, scalable laser platforms, however, customizing laser-gain media to support wholly new bands is challenging and often prohibitively mismatched in scalability to early quantum-based sensing and information systems. Here, we demonstrate a microresonator optical-parametric oscillator (OPO) that converts a pump laser to an output wave within a frequency span exceeding an octave. We achieve phase matching for oscillation by nanopatterning the microresonator to open a photonic-crystal bandgap on the mode of the pump laser. By adjusting the nanophotonic pattern and hence the bandgap, the ratio of output OPO wave frequency span to required pump laser tuning is more than 10,000. We also demonstrate tuning the oscillator in free-spectral-range steps, more finely with temperature, and minimal additive frequency noise of the laser-conversion process. Our work shows that nanophotonics offers control of laser conversion in microresonators, bridging phase-matching of nonlinear optics and application requirements for laser designs.</description>

      <title>Tutorials on Monte-Carlo modeling of photon transport in biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological tissues are complex structures composed of many elements which make light-based tissue diagnostics challenging. Over the past decades, Monte Carlo technique has been used as a fundamental and versatile approach toward modeling photon-tissue interactions. This report first describes a MC simulation of steady-state light transport in an absorbing and diffusing multi-layered structure. Further, a parallel processing solution is implemented to reduce execution time and memory requirements. Then, the nonparametric phase function, which is a discretized version of the phase function, has been discussed where the integration of the phase function is a numerical process, instead of an analytical operation. Finally, to simulate more realistic structures of biological systems, simulations are modified to incorporate objects of various shapes (sphere, ellipsoid, or cylinder) with a refractive-index mismatched boundary. The output files mainly contain 2D reflection matrix, 2D transmission matrix, and 3D absorption matrix.</description>

      <title>Dual grating single-shot pump-probe technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple and effective single-shot pump-probe technique is reported. Using only two commercial gratings, a large time window of 95.4 ps is spatially encoded in a single probe pulse, and single-shot time-resolved measurements are implemented. The time window exceeds the maximum reported values for single-shot pump-probe techniques using the echelon or angle beam encoding strategy. The phase difference problem in the echelon encoding strategies is also eliminated and a customized echelon is not needed in this technique. The measurements of the ultrafast two-photon absorption dynamics of ZnSe at a wavelength of 650 nm verify the effectiveness of this technique.</description>

      <title>Reduction of temperature drift in refractive-index-sensing optical frequency comb by active-dummy compensation of dual-comb configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractive-index (RI) sensing plays a pivotal role in various domains, encompassing applications like glucose sensing, biosensing, and gas detection. Despite the advantages of optical fiber sensors, such as their compact size, flexibility, and immunity to electromagnetic interference, they are often plagued by temperature-induced drift, which adversely impacts the accuracy of RI measurements. This study introduces an innovative approach to alleviate temperature-induced drift in RI-sensing optical frequency combs (OFCs) by employing active-dummy compensation. The central idea revolves around the utilization of a dual-comb setup, comprising an active-sensing OFC that monitors both sample RI and environmental temperature, and a dummy-sensing OFC that exclusively tracks environmental temperature. The disparity between these sensor signals, denoted as delta_frep, effectively nullifies the effects of temperature variations, yielding a temperature-independent sensor signal for precise RI measurements. This investigation delves into the relationship between active-dummy temperature compensation and delta_frep. It becomes evident that diminishing delta_frep values enhance temperature compensation, thereby diminishing fluctuations in delta_frep caused by environmental temperature shifts. This compensation technique establishes a direct link between delta_frep and sample RI, paving the way for absolute RI measurements based on delta_frep. The findings of this research are a valuable contribution to the advancement of accurate and temperature-compensated RI sensing methodologies using dual-comb setup. The insights gained regarding delta_frep dependency and the strategies proposed for enhancing measurement precision and stability hold significant promise for applications in fields of product quality control and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Extremely long transverse optical needle focus for reflective metalens enabled by monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line-scan mode facilitates fast-speed and high-throughput imaging with developing a suitable optical transverse needle focus. Metasurface with periodic structures such as diffractive rings, ellipses, and gratings could enable discrete focus evolving into line focus under momentum conservation, but still face the challenge of extremely low light power utilization brought by inevitably multiple high-order diffractions. In addition, the designed focus requires the selection of particular optical functional materials. High dielectric constants in atomic transition metal dichalcogenides make significant phase modulation by bringing phase singularity at zero-reflection possible. However, no light power is available for use at zero-reflection and a balance between phase and amplitude modulation is needed. In this work, above issues are simultaneously solved by designing a monolayer MoS2 based Fresnel strip structure. An optical needle primary focus with a transverse length of 40 {\mu}m (~80 {\lambda}) is obtained, which is the longest value recorded so far, together with a sub-diffraction-limited lateral spot and a broad working wavelength range. This specially developed structure not only concentrates light power in primary diffraction by breaking restriction of momentum conservation, but also guarantees a consistent phase across different strips. The novel optical manipulation way provided here together with the longer focus length for flat optics will show promising applications in biology, oncology, nanofabrication, energy harvesting, and optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous phase locking in a broad-area semiconductor laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad-area semiconductor lasers are employed in many high-power applications, however, their spatio-temporal dynamics is complex and intrinsically unstable due to the interaction of several transverse lasing modes. A dynamical and spatio-spectral analysis with ultra-high resolution of commercial broad-area lasers reveals multiplets of phase locked first- and second-order transverse modes that are spontaneously created by the nonlinear dynamics for a wide range of operation parameters. Phase locking between modes of different transverse order is demonstrated by comparing the linewidths of the lasing modes to that of their beat note as well as by a direct measurement of their phase fluctuation correlations. Since the laser and the setup lack any feature designed to induce locking and the overall dynamics is unstable, the observation of this spontaneous phase locking effect is very unexpected. Our findings indicate that chimera-like states featuring groups of synchronized oscillators coexisting with unsynchronized ones can spontaneously form in broad-area lasers, and may thus be found in a wider range of optical systems and beyond than previously assumed. Moreover, some of the phase locked modes do not even exist on the passive-cavity level, but are created by the nonlinear dynamics, an effect not previously observed in the context of chimera states.</description>

      <title>The comparative study of high efficiency of Tm^{3+}-doped fiber laser at 1.72 \mu m for different pump schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we revealed the impact of the pumping scheme, fiber length, pumping power, and reflectivity of the output fiber Bragg grating on the performance of a Tm^3+ -doped fiber laser (TDFL) operating at a wavelength of 1.72 \mu m. Using numerical simulations, we optimized the output power and reduced losses due to reabsorption; as well as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at approximately 1820 nm. The Tm^3+ -doped fiber was bi-directionally pumped at 1570 nm to enhance the pump absorption. The simulations suggest that a maximum power of 5.96W at 1.72 \mu m and a slope efficiency of 64 % are achievable using a Tm^{3+}-doped silica fiber with a bi-directional pump of 4 W forward and 6 W backward.</description>

      <title>Multiple Bound States in the Continuum: Towards Intense Terahertz Matter Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are an excellent platform enabling highly efficient light-matter interaction in applications for lasing, nonlinear generation, and sensing. However, the current focus in implementing BICs has primarily been on single sharp resonances, limiting the extent of electric field enhancement for multiple resonances. In this study, we conducted experimental demonstrations to showcase how metasurfaces can enable the control of symmetry-broken and Friedrich-Wintgen BICs by leveraging the asymmetry of split resonant rings. This approach allows for the existence of multiple free-control BIC resonances and tailored enhancement of controlling light-matter interactions. We have conducted further experiments to validate the effectiveness and performance of our approach for identification of the distinct fingerprint of {\alpha}-lactose with high sensitivity using only one single metasurface. These findings present a novel and efficient platform for the development of miniaturized and chip-scale photonics devices with intense light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Integration of Freestanding Photonic Devices with Color Centers in Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color center platforms have been at the forefront of quantum nanophotonics for applications in quantum networking, computing, and sensing. However, large-scale deployment of this technology has been stifled by a lack of ability to integrate photonic devices at scale while maintaining the properties of quantum emitters. We address this challenge in silicon carbide which has both commercially available wafer-scale substrates and is a host to color centers with desirable optical and spin properties. Using ion beam etching at an angle, we develop a 5-inch wafer process for the fabrication of triangular cross-section photonic devices in bulk 4H-SiC. The developed process has a variability in etch rate and etch angle of 5.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the integrated color centers maintain their optical properties after the etch, thus achieving the nanofabrication goal of wafer-scale nanofabrication in quantum-grade silicon carbide.</description>

      <title>Side-polished Silica-Fluoride Multimode Fibre Pump Combiner for Mid-IR Fibre Lasers and Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Side-pumping fibre combiners offer several advantages in fibre laser design, including distributed pump absorption, reduced heat load, and improved flexibility and reliability. These benefits are particularly important for all-fibre lasers and amplifiers operating in the mid-IR wavelength range and based on soft-glass optical fibres. However, conventional fabrication methods face limitations due to significant differences in the thermal properties of pump-delivering silica fibres and signal-guiding fluoride-based fibres. To address these challenges, this work introduces a design for a fuse-less side-polished (D-shaped) fibre-based pump combiner comprising multimode silica and double-clad fluoride-based fibres. The results demonstrate stable coupling efficiency exceeding 80% at a 980-nm wavelength over 8 hours of continuous operation under active thermal control. The developed pump combiner has also been successfully integrated into a linear Er-doped fibre laser cavity, showing continuous-wave generation at 2731 or 2781-nm central wavelength with an output power of 0.87 W. Overall, this innovative approach presents a simple, repeatable, and reproducible pump combiner design that opens up new possibilities for leveraging fibre-based component technology in soft glass matrices and other emerging fibres with unique compositions.</description>

Abstract: Interferometric scattering microscopy is a powerful technique that enables various applications, such as mass photometry and particle tracking. Here we present a numerical toolbox to simulate images obtained in interferometric scattering, coherent bright-field, and dark-field microscopy. The scattered fields are calculated using a boundary element method, facilitating the simulation of arbitrary sample geometries and substrate layer structures. A fully vectorial model is used for simulating the imaging setup. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our simulations and experiments for different shapes of scatterers and excitation angles. Notably, for angles near the Brewster angle, we observe a contrast enhancement which may be beneficial for nanosensing applications. The software is available as a Matlab toolbox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape measurement of rod-shaped particles in fluids is an outstanding challenge with applications in characterising synthetic functional nanoparticles and in early warning detection of rod-shaped pathogens in water supplies. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate and real-time measurements at a single particle scale in solution with existing methods. Here we introduce a novel technique to measure the aspect ratio of rod-shaped particles by analysing changes in the polarisation state of a laser beam transmitted through an optical microcavity through which the particle diffuses. The resolution in aspect ratio measurement is found to be around 1%. Our work opens the new possibility of in-situ and single-particle shape measurements, which have promising applications in nanoparticle characterisation, water monitoring, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of a tunable hybrid III-V-on-silicon laser for spectral characterization of fiber Bragg grating sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors offer multiple benefits in comparison with electronic sensors due to their compactness, electromagnetic immunity as well as their resistance to harsh environments and their multiplexing capabilities. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is one of the various potential industrial applications that could take full advantage of those sensors. However, there is a need for a low size, weight, power and cost interrogation unit for certain application areas such as aerospace or aeronautics. That is the reason why recent efforts have been made to use integrated components and circuits for interrogation of FBGs. Among different techniques, interrogation with a swept laser source is of high interest since it has a high multiplexing capability and could reach a high level of integration using other integrated components such as photodetectors, grating couplers or directional couplers to form a compact interrogation unit. In this paper, we present characterization results of a fully-packaged hybrid III-V on silicon tunable laser diode operating in the C and L bands. Wavelength maps are produced and analyzed and modulation of emitted wavelength is discussed. Preliminary results corresponding to a moderate frequency (10-Hz sweep rate) were obtained and FBG reflection spectra acquired with a broadband source (BBS) and a swept laser diode are compared. Finally, we discuss potential design improvements in order to reach high scan rates (&gt; 10 kHz) and a large tuning range.</description>

      <title>Propagation-invariant strongly longitudinally polarized toroidal pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in optical, terahertz, and microwave systems have unveiled non-transverse optical toroidal pulses characterized by skyrmionic topologies, fractal-like singularities, space-time nonseparability, and anapole-exciting ability. Despite this, the longitudinally polarized fields of canonical toroidal pulses notably lag behind their transverse counterparts in magnitude. Interestingly, although mushroom-cloud-like toroidal vortices with strong longitudinal fields are common in nature, they remain unexplored in the realm of electromagnetics. Here, we present strongly longitudinally polarized toroidal pulses (SLPTPs) which boast a longitudinal component amplitude exceeding that of the transverse component by over tenfold. This unique polarization property endows SLPTPs with robust propagation characteristics, showcasing nondiffracting behavior. The propagation-invariant strongly longitudinally polarized field holds promise for pioneering light-matter interactions, far-field superresolution microscopy, and high-capacity wireless communication utilizing three polarizations.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate a time-delayed reservoir computer architecture based on a single mode laser diode with optical injection and optical feedback. Through a high-resolution parametric analysis, we reveal unforeseen regions of high dynamical consistency. We demonstrate furthermore that the best computing performance is not achieved at the edge of consistency as previously suggested in a coarser parametric analysis. This region of high consistency and optimal reservoir performances are highly sensitive to the data input modulation format</description>

Abstract: The on-chip photonic switch is a critical building block for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) enables non-volatile switch designs that are compact, low-loss, and energy-efficient. Existing switch designs based on these materials typically rely on weak evanescent field interactions, resulting in devices with a large footprint and high energy consumption. Here we present a compact non-volatile 2 by 2 switch design leveraging optical concentration in slot waveguide modes to significantly enhance interactions of light with PCMs, thereby realizing a compact, efficient photonic switch. To further improve the device's energy efficiency, we introduce an integrated single-layer graphene heater for ultrafast electrothermal switching of the PCM. Computational simulations demonstrate a 2 by 2 switch with crosstalk (CT) down to -24 dB at 1550 nm wavelength and more than 55 nm 0.3 dB insertion loss (IL) bandwidth. The proposed photonic switch architecture can constitute the cornerstone for next-generation high-performance reconfigurable photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Effective medium properties of stealthy hyperuniform photonic structures using multiscale physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse retrieval of the effective permittivity and homogenization of finite-size photonic media with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs are capable of capturing the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inverse retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. We believe that the multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Interactions between fractional solitons in bimodal fiber cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a system of fractional nonlinear Schroedinger equations (FNLSEs) which model the copropagation of optical waves carried by different wavelengths or mutually orthogonal circular polarizations in fiber-laser cavities with the effective fractional group-velocity dispersion (FGVD), which were recently made available to the experiment. In the FNLSE system, the FGVD terms are represented by the Riesz derivatives, with the respective Levy index (LI). The FNLSEs, which include the nonlinear self-phase-modulation (SPM) nonlinearity, are coupled by the cross-phase modulation (XPM) terms, and separated by a group-velocity (GV) mismatch (rapidity). By means of systematic simulations, we analyze collisions and bound states of solitons in the XPM-coupled system, varying the LI and GV mismatch. Outcomes of collisions between the solitons include rebound, conversion of the colliding single-component solitons into a pair of two-component ones, merger of the solitons into a breather, their mutual passage leading to excitation of intrinsic vibrations, and the elastic interaction. Families of stable two-component soliton bound states are constructed too, featuring a rapidity which is intermediate between those of the two components.</description>

      <title>Ultraprecise time-difference measurement via enhanced dual pointers with multiple weak interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard weak measurement with an assistant pointer and single weak interaction constrains measurement precision and quantity of interaction parameters, and a compelling characterization of quantum effect featuring weak-value amplification (WVA) remains elusive. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate an enhanced dual-pointer WVA scheme based on multiple weak interactions and variable spectrum sources. Developing triple weak interactions, momentum P pointer reaches an optimal time-difference precision of $3.34 \times {10^{-5}}$ as at 6 nm spectral width, and intensity I pointer achieves a displacement resolution of 148.8 fm within 400 kHz linewidth. A quantum effect associated with an anomalous weak value is revealed by an observable violation of a Leggett-Garg inequality. The I-pointer weak value is measured to be 1478 using multiple weak interactions and high signal-to-noise detection, achieving a two-order-of-magnitude WVA enhancement compared to standard weak measurement. Our work opens up a practical avenue for minuscule quantumness measurements in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Optically-Sampled Superconducting-Nanostrip Photon-Number Resolving Detector for Non-Classical Quantum State Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon number-resolving detectors (PNRDs) are the ultimate optical sensors. Superconducting-nanostrip photon detectors (SNSPDs), traditionally known as ON-OFF detectors, have recently been found to have photon number resolving capability without multiplexing. This discovery positions them to become true PNRDs. However, their practical use is limited by the need to precisely detect tiny signal differences with low signal-to-noise ratios within sub-nanosecond time frames. We overcome this challenge using optical sampling with a dual-output Mach Zehnder modulator (DO-MZM) and ultra-short pulsed laser. By adjusting the DO-MZM's bias voltage to nearly balance the outputs, this method enables sensitive detection of picosecond-order signal differences, achieving a temporal resolution of 1.9 ps and facilitating real-time photon number resolution. We applied this method to produce various non-classical quantum states, enhancing their non-classicality through photon number resolution. This advancement marks a significant shift from principle verification to practical application for SNSPD-type PNRDs in diverse quantum optics fields.</description>

      <title>Photonic random walks with traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walks behave very differently for classical and quantum particles. Here we unveil a ubiquitous distinctive behavior of random walks of a photon in a one-dimensional lattice in the presence of a finite number of traps, at which the photon can be destroyed and the walk terminates. While for a classical random walk the photon is unavoidably destroyed by the traps, for a quantum walk the photon can remain alive and the walk continues forever. Such an intriguing behavior is illustrated by considering photonic random walks in synthetic mesh lattices with controllable decoherence, which enables to switch from quantum to classical random walks.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-induced mobility edges in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobility edges (ME), separating Anderson-localized states from extended states, are known to arise in the single-particle energy spectrum of certain one-dimensional lattices with aperiodic order. Dephasing and decoherence effects are widely acknowledged to spoil Anderson localization and to enhance transport, suggesting that ME and localization are unlikely to be observable in the presence of dephasing. Here it is shown that, contrary to such a wisdom, ME can be created by pure dephasing effects in quasicrystals in which all states are delocalized under coherent dynamics. Since the lifetimes of localized states induced by dephasing effects can be extremely long, rather counter-intuitively decoherence can enhance localization of excitation in the lattice. The results are illustrated by considering photonic quantum walks in synthetic mesh lattices.</description>

      <title>Phase coding semi-quantum key distribution system based on the Single-state protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) allows sharing random keys between a quantum user and a classical user. However, implementing classical user operations is challenging, posing a hurdle to achieving the Single-state protocol. By using the "selective modulation" method, the feasibility of SQKD is verified in principle. The proposal of the selective modulation method enables the realization of other protocols for SQKD. To advance experimental progress in SQKD, we propose and implement a phase-encoded semi-quantum key distribution system based on the Single-state protocol and the "selective modulation" method. The system operates at a frequency of 100MHz and an average photon number of 0.1. The interference contrast achieved 96.52%, the average quantum bit error rate was 1.19%, and the raw key rate reached 88Kbps. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the proposed phase-encoded semi-quantum key distribution system. Furthermore, by leveraging the "selective modulation" scheme proposed in this paper, we develop a comprehensive theoretical description of selective modulation. Through an analysis of quantum state evolution, we assess the security of our system, ultimately demonstrating its resilience against attacks targeting quantum states. The classical user of our system requires only two optical devices, significantly reducing the equipment requirements and enhancing its application potential. This work validates the feasibility of semi-quantum key distribution experiments and provides ideas for future research on semi-quantum key distribution experiments and security studies.</description>

Abstract: Emerging from the symbiotic combination of nanotechnology and communications, the field of nanonetworking has come a long way since its inception more than fifteen years ago. Significant progress has been achieved in several key communication technologies as enablers of the paradigm, as well as in the multiple application areas that it opens. In this paper, the focus is placed on the electromagnetic nanonetworking paradigm, providing an overview of the advances made in wireless nanocommunication technology from microwave through terahertz to optical bands. The characteristics and potential of the compared technologies are then confronted with the requirements and challenges of the broad set of nanonetworking applications in the Internet of NanoThings (IoNT) and on-chip networks paradigms, including quantum computing applications for the first time. Finally, a selection of cross-cutting issues and possible directions for future work are given, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners towards the next generation of electromagnetic nanonetworks.</description>

      <title>Sub-percent Characterization and Polarimetric Performance Analysis of Commercial Micro-polarizer Array Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization imaging can yield crucial information in multiple applications of remote sensing, such as characterization of clouds, aerosols, and the Aurora Borealis. Some applications require sub-percent polarimetric sensitivity and accuracy in determining the Stokes parameters, which can be a challenge to attain. In 2018, Sony released a low-cost CMOS-based imaging chip with integrated micro-polarizer array for general polarization measurements. We implement the calibration steps required for these Sony chips to reach sub-percent polarimetric accuracies. To analyze their performances, we have compared the characteristics of four different detector packages by three manufacturers housing either the monochromatic version or the RGB color variant. We present a comprehensive overview of the effects that these characteristics have on the polarimetric performance of the camera. They include dark noise, behavior over different gain settings, detector/pixel artifacts, and polarimetric effects determined by polarizer extinction ratios, polarizer orientations, and accuracy of polarimetric zero points due to differential pixel gains. In addition to calibrations using unpolarized light and fully linearly polarized light, we assess the polarimetric sensitivity within a tilting and rotating glass-plate set-up. We discuss the benefits of adding a rotating half-wave plate as an additional temporal modulator to generically mitigate some of the detector effects, and achieve better polarimetric sensitivity/accuracy albeit at the expense of lower temporal resolution. We conclude by presenting and discussing the polarimetric limits to which we were able to calibrate the detector effects for practical purposes. By reaching a compound absolute polarimetric uncertainty of less than a percent, these very compact, low-cost detectors are enabled for a multitude of scientific goals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly-driven nonlinear optical processes such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing can produce multiphoton nonclassical beams of light which have applications in quantum information processing and sensing. In contrast to the low-gain regime, new physical effects arise in a high-gain regime due to the interactions between the nonclassical light and the strong pump driving the nonlinear process. Here, we describe and experimentally observe a gain-induced group delay between the multiphoton pulses generated in a high-gain type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. Since the group delay introduces distinguishability between the generated photons, it will be important to compensate for it when designing quantum interference devices in which strong optical nonlinearities are required.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Pockels Coefficient of Ferroelectric Nitride ScAlN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitride ferroelectrics have recently emerged as promising alternatives to oxide ferroelectrics due to their compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. ScAlN, in particular, has exhibited remarkable piezoelectric coupling strength ($K^2$) comparable to that of lithium niobate (LN), making it a valuable choice for RF filters in wireless communications. Recently, ScAlN has sparked interest in its use for nanophotonic devices, chiefly due to its large bandgap facilitating operation in blue wavelengths coupled with promises of enhanced nonlinear optical properties such as a large second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). It is still an open question whether ScAlN can outperform oxide ferroelectrics concerning the Pockels effect -- an electro-optic coupling extensively utilized in optical communications devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of ScAlN's Pockels effect. Our findings reveal that the electro-optic coupling of ScAlN, despite being weak at low Sc concentration, may be significantly enhanced at high levels of Sc doping, which points the direction of continued research efforts to unlock the full potential of ScAlN.</description>

Abstract: Emitters based on photoconductive materials excited by ultrafast lasers are well established and popular devices for THz generation. However, so far, these emitters, both photoconductive antennas and large area emitters, were mostly explored using driving lasers with moderate average powers (either fiber lasers with up to hundreds of milliwatts or Ti:Sapphire systems up to few watts). In this paper, we explore the use of high power, MHz repetition rate Ytterbium (Yb) based oscillator for THz emission using a microstructured large area photoconductive emitter, consist of semi insulating GaAs with a 10 by 10 mm2 active area. As a driving source, we use a frequency doubled home built high average power ultrafast Yb oscillator, delivering 22 W of average power, 115 fs pulses with 91 MHz repetition rate at a central wavelength of 516 nm. When applying 9 W of average power (after an optical chopper with a duty cycle of 50 percent) on the structure without optimized heatsinking, we obtain 65 uW THz average power, 4 THz bandwidth; furthermore, we safely apply up to 18 W of power on the structure without observing damage. We investigate the impact of excitation power, bias voltage, optical fluence, and their interplay on the emitter performance and explore in detail the sources of thermal load originating from electrical and optical power. Optical power is found to have a more critical impact on LAE saturation than electrical power, thus optimized heatsinking will allow us to improve the conversion efficiency in the near future towards much higher emitter power. This work paves the way towards achieving hundreds of MHz or even GHz repetition rates, high power THz sources based on photoconductive emitters, that are of great interest for example for future THz imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of birefringence inhomogeneity of KAGRA sapphire mirrors from transmitted wavefront error measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooling down test masses to cryogenic temperatures is a way to reduce the thermal noise of gravitational wave detectors. Crystalline materials are considered the most promising materials for fabricating cryogenic test masses and their coatings because of their excellent thermal and optical properties at low temperatures. However, birefringence owing to local impurities and inhomogeneities in the crystal can degrade the performance of the detector. The birefringence measurement or mapping over a two-dimensional area is thus important. This study describes a method for fast birefringence measurements of a large sample by simply combining a series of transmission wavefront error measurements using linearly polarised light with Fizeau interferometers. Using this method, the birefringence inhomogeneity information of KAGRA's two input test masses with a diameter of 22 cm was fully reconstructed. The birefringence information was then used to calculate the transverse beam shapes of the light fields in orthogonal polarisation directions when passing through the substrate. The calculated beam shapes showed a good agreement with the in-situ measurements using the KAGRA interferometer. This technique is crucial for birefringence characterisation of test masses in future detectors, where even larger sizes are used.</description>

      <title>Broadband microwave waveform generation with programmable chirp shapes via recirculating phase-modulated optical fiber loop controlled by low-speed electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broadband microwave waveforms with programmable chirp shapes are captivating in numerous practical applications. Compared with electronic technology, photonic-assisted solutions exhibit excellent performance in bandwidth and flexibility, but still suffer from complex architecture and requirement of high-speed electronics. Besides, rapid manipulation of chirp shape is still a challenge in the scientific community. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a novel concept for generating broadband microwave waveforms with programmable chirp shapes. This concept is realized on a simple fiber-optic platform involving a continuous-wave laser source, a recirculating phase-modulated optical fiber loop, and low-speed electronics with a sampling rate at the level of MS/s. Based on this method, chirped microwave waveforms with a bandwidth up to tens of GHz can be generated, where the chirp shape is identical to the low-frequency driving waveform of the recirculating phase-modulated optical fiber loop. In addition, all the parameters of the generated chirped microwave waveforms can be easily reconfigured in real time, including the bandwidth, the central frequency, and the temporal duration. In the experiment, broadband microwave waveforms with customized chirp shapes are generated, where the center frequency and bandwidth tuning ranges exceed 21 GHz, the temporal duration is tuned in the range of 9 ns to 180 ns, and the coherent time of the generated microwave waveform is larger than 100 {\mu}s. This simple fiber-optic platform paves a way to generate broadband microwave waveforms with user-definable chirp shapes, which can find applications in broadband radar systems, electronic warfare and wireless communications.</description>

Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies such as effective quantum communication require room temperature (RT) operating single- or few- photon sensors with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 1550 nm wavelength. The leading class of devices in this segment is avalanche photodetectors operating particularly in the Geiger mode. Often the requirements for RT operation and for a high EQE are in conflict, resulting in a compromised solution. We have developed a device which employs a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material on a co-optimized dielectric photonic crystal substrate to simultaneously decrease the dark current by three orders of magnitude at RT and maintain an EQE of &gt;99%. The device is amenable to avalanching and form a basis for single photon detection with ultra-low dark current and high photodetection efficiency. Harnessing the high carrier mobility of 2D materials, the device has ~ps jitter time and can be integrated into a large 2D array camera.</description>

      <title>Spin Hamiltonians in the Modulated Momenta of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic solvers that are able to find the ground states of different spin Hamiltonians can be used to study many interactive physical systems and combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we establish a real-and-momentum space correspondence of spin Hamiltonians by spatial light transport. The real-space spin interaction is determined by modulating the momentum-space flow of light. This principle is formulated as a generalized Plancherel theorem, allowing us to implement a simple optical simulator that can find the ground states for any displacement-dependent spin interactions. Particularly, we use this principle to reveal the exotic magnetic phase diagram from a J1-J2-J3 model, and we also observe the vortex-mediated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dynamics from the XY model. These experiments exhibit high calculation precision by subtly controlling spin interactions from the momentum space of light, offering a promising scheme to explore novel physical effects.</description>

Abstract: A coherent optical spectrum analyzer is integrated with a rotating quarter wave plate polarimeter. The combined polarimeter optical spectrum analyzer (POSA) allows the extraction of the state of polarization with high spectral resolution. POSA is used in this work to study two optical systems. The first is an optical modulator based on a ferrimagnetic sphere resonator. POSA is employed to explore the underlying magneto-optical mechanism responsible for modulation sideband asymmetry. The second system under study is a cryogenic fiber loop laser, which produces an unequally spaced optical comb. Polarization measurements provide insights on the nonlinear processes responsible for comb creation. Characterizations extracted from POSA data provide guidelines for performance optimization of applications based on these systems under study.</description>

      <title>Solving Maxwell's Equations Using Polarimetry Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations are solved when the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field are determined at all points in space. Generally, the Stokes parameters can only capture the amplitude and polarization state of the electromagnetic field in the radiation (far) zone. Therefore, the measurement of the Stokes parameters is, in general, insufficient to solve Maxwell's equations. In this Letter, we solve Maxwell's equations for a set of objects widely used in Nanophotonics using the Stokes parameters alone. Our method for solving Maxwell's equations endows the Stokes parameters an even more fundamental role in the electromagnetic scattering theory.</description>

      <title>The depth of the banana and the impulse stripe illumination for diffuse optical tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stripe illumination lies between the illumination in the spatial-frequency domain and the point illumination. Although the stripe illumination has a periodic structure as the illumination in the spatial-frequency domain, light from the stripe illumination can reach deep regions in biological tissue since it can be regarded as an array of point illuminations. For a pair of a source and a detector, the shape of light paths which connect the source and detector is called the banana shape. First, we investigate the depth of the banana. In the case of the zero boundary condition, we found that the depth of the center of the banana is about $0.2d_{\rm SD}$ for typical optical parameters, where $d_{\rm SD}$ is the distance between the source and detector on the boundary. In general, the depth depends on the absorption and diffusion coefficients, and the ratio of refractive indices on the boundary. Next, we perform diffuse optical tomography for the stripe illumination against forward data taken by Monte Carlo simulation. We consider an impulse illumination of the shape of a stripe. By this time-resolved measurement, the absorption coefficient of a target is reconstructed.</description>

      <title>Spectral stability of V2 centres in sub-micron 4H-SiC membranes</title>

Abstract: Colour centres in silicon carbide emerge as a promising semiconductor quantum technology platform with excellent spin-optical coherences.However, recent efforts towards maximising the photonic efficiency via integration into nanophotonic structures proved to be challenging due to reduced spectral stabilities. Here, we provide a large-scale systematic investigation on silicon vacancy centres in thin silicon carbide membranes with thicknesses down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$. Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of $3-4\,\rm\r{A}$, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of $0.7 \,\rm\mu m$. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below $200\,\rm MHz$, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.</description>
