      <title>A time-stepping deep gradient flow method for option pricing in (rough) diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European options in diffusion models, that can efficiently handle high-dimensional problems resulting from Markovian approximations of rough volatility models. The option pricing partial differential equation is reformulated as an energy minimization problem, which is approximated in a time-stepping fashion by deep artificial neural networks. The proposed scheme respects the asymptotic behavior of option prices for large levels of moneyness, and adheres to a priori known bounds for option prices. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is assessed in a series of numerical examples, with particular focus in the lifted Heston model.</description>

      <title>Randomized Control in Performance Analysis and Empirical Asset Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present article explores the application of randomized control techniques in empirical asset pricing and performance evaluation. It introduces geometric random walks, a class of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, to construct flexible control groups in the form of random portfolios adhering to investor constraints. The sampling-based methods enable an exploration of the relationship between academically studied factor premia and performance in a practical setting. In an empirical application, the study assesses the potential to capture premias associated with size, value, quality, and momentum within a strongly constrained setup, exemplified by the investor guidelines of the MSCI Diversified Multifactor index. Additionally, the article highlights issues with the more traditional use case of random portfolios for drawing inferences in performance evaluation, showcasing challenges related to the intricacies of high-dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Simulations: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Limit Order Books (LOBs) serve as a mechanism for buyers and sellers to interact with each other in the financial markets. Modelling and simulating LOBs is quite often necessary for calibrating and fine-tuning the automated trading strategies developed in algorithmic trading research. The recent AI revolution and availability of faster and cheaper compute power has enabled the modelling and simulations to grow richer and even use modern AI techniques. In this review we examine the various kinds of LOB simulation models present in the current state of the art. We provide a classification of the models on the basis of their methodology and provide an aggregate view of the popular stylized facts used in the literature to test the models. We additionally provide a focused study of price impact's presence in the models since it is one of the more crucial phenomena to model in algorithmic trading. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of various qualities of fits of these models and how they perform when tested against empirical data.</description>
