      <title>Advanced Knife-Edge free Self-Aligned Colour Schlieren Imaging with Extended Measuring Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schlieren imaging is a powerful, non-intrusive method widely used to visualize refractive index gradients in fluid dynamics and heat transfer studies, essential in fields like aerospace engineering, combustion analysis, and supersonic flow visualization. Traditional Schlieren imaging setups employ a knife-edge cut-off to differentiate between deviated and non-deviated light rays, creating contrast. However, this approach requires highly precise alignment and limits both usability and measurement range, restricting accurate observation of high-gradient phenomena such as combustion processes at elevated temperatures. Here, we proposed a simplified Schlieren imaging method that eliminates the knife edge by introducing a novel integration of an extended RGB segmented colour source with a circular aperture. Our approach significantly simplifies alignment, enables colour visualization, and we achieve expanded measuring range by approximately threefold. Experimental validation, involving imaging hot air plumes generated from butane combustion and transparent adhesive tape tests, demonstrate significant improved performance, including enhanced visibility near regions of high temperature gradients, improved edge detection, and precise visualization of large refractive gradients. This simplified yet robust Schlieren imaging approach substantially broadens the scope and ease of application, facilitating detailed investigations of previously challenging fluid phenomena.</description>

      <title>On-chip arbitrary dispersion engineering with deep photonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the design and optimization of on-chip arbitrary dispersion profiles using deep photonic networks constructed from custom-designed Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These photonic networks employ optimizable waveguide tapers, enabling precise engineering of wavelength-dependent dispersion profiles. We experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-concept two-port photonic network that exhibits a highly nonintuitive triangular dispersion profile over the wavelength range of 1.54 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ to 1.58 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ while simultaneously achieving a flat-band transmission with an insertion loss of less than 0.7 dB. We also illustrate the potential of multi-port photonic networks to enhance design freedom for more complex and customizable dispersion profiles, enabling new possibilities for on-chip dispersion engineering.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency broadband active metasurfaces via reversible metal electrodeposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing active metasurfaces with substantial tunability is important for many applications but remains challenging due to difficulties in dynamically tuning light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales. Here, we introduce reversible metal electrodeposition as a versatile approach for enabling active metasurfaces with exceptional tunability across a broad bandwidth. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a dynamic beam-steering device by performing reversible copper (Cu) electrodeposition on a reflective gradient metasurface composed of metal-insulator-metal resonators. By applying different voltages, the Cu atoms can be uniformly and reversibly electrodeposited and stripped around the resonators, effectively controlling the gap-surface plasmon resonances and steering the reflected light. This process experimentally achieved &gt;90% diffraction efficiencies and &gt;60% reflection efficiencies in both specular and anomalous modes, even after thousands of cycles. Moreover, these high efficiencies can be extended from the visible to the near- and mid-infrared regimes, demonstrating the broad versatility of this approach in enabling various active optical and thermal devices with different working wavelengths and bandwidths.</description>

      <title>Infrared phonon Thermoreflectance in Polar Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate dielectric materials for thermoreflectance-based thermal sensing by extracting key optical parameters using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry in the mid-infrared regime. Leveraging optical phonon resonances, we demonstrate that the thermoreflectance coefficients in polar dielectrics rival, and in some cases exceed by an order of magnitude, those observed in commonly used metals that are typically used as temperature transducers in thermoreflectance measurements. We introduce a transducer figure of merit (FOM) that combines pump absorption and probe reflectance modulation at different wavelengths. Our findings reveal that materials such as sapphire and aluminum nitride can outperform metals by up to two orders of magnitude. These results position dielectric materials as compelling candidates for next-generation thermal metrology, broadening the design space for optical thermometry, with strong implications for high-resolution thermal mapping and characterization of layered device structures based on phonon probing.</description>

      <title>Fast Prediction of Phase shifters Phase Error Distributions Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for evaluating random phase errors in phase shifters within photonic integrated circuits, avoiding the computational cost of traditional Monte Carlo simulations. By modeling spatially correlated manufacturing variations as a stationary Gaussian process and applying linear functional theory, our approach enables rapid prediction of phase difference distributions through numerical integration. We validate the method using tolerance optimization and virtual manufacturing experiments, demonstrating its accuracy and significant reduction in computational burden. This framework offers a practical and scalable alternative for error analysis and robust design in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation and scattering in time dependent media: Lippmann-Schwinger equations, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems and Huygens' principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave scattering plays a central role for the modeling of complex wave propagation across all corners of science and engineering applications, including electromagnetic, acoustics, seismic and scattering physics. Wave control using time interfaces, where the properties of the medium through with the wave travels rapidly change in time, has opened further opportunities to control wave propagation in both space and time. For acoustic waves, studies on time modulated media have not been reported. In this context, full numerical solution of the wave equation using time interfaces is key to fully understand their potential. When applying time interfaces, the underlying physics of acoustic wave propagation and scattering and their similar roles on time and space, are still being explored. In this work, we introduce a mathematical formulation of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for acoustic wave scattering when time interfaces are induced via a change of the velocity of the medium. We demonstrate that space-time duality for acoustic wave propagation with time interfaces and derive the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for wave scattering in time-dependent media, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems. We experimentally verify our theoretical derivation by studying and measuring the acoustic wave scattering in strongly scattering media. We illustrate the proposed framework and present results of acoustic wave scattering without prior knowledge of the background wave-fields. This improves the understanding of the generation and wave scattering and opens previously inaccessible research directions, potentially facilitating practical applications for acoustic, geophysical and optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maxwell-Garnett theory, dating back to James Clerk Maxwell-Garnett's foundational work in 1904, provides a simple yet powerful framework to describe the inhomogeneous structure as an effective homogeneous medium, which significantly reduces the overall complexity of analysis, calculation, and design. As such, the Maxwell-Garnett theory enables many practical applications in diverse realms, ranging from photonics, acoustics, mechanics, thermodynamics, to material science. It has long been thought that the Maxwell-Garnett theory of light in impedance-mismatched periodic structures is valid only within the long-wavelength limit, necessitating either the temporal or spatial period of light to be much larger than that of structures. Here, we break this long-held belief by revealing an anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for impedance-mismatched photonic time crystals beyond this long-wavelength limit. The key to this anomaly lies in the Fabry-Perot resonance. We discover that under the Fabry-P\'erot resonance, the impedance-mismatched photonic time crystal could be essentially equivalent to a homogeneous temporal slab simultaneously at specific discrete wavelengths, despite the temporal period of these light being comparable to or even much smaller than that of photonic time crystals.</description>

      <title>Loss-free enhancement of photonic spin Hall shift by electromagnetically induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE), a result of spin-orbit interaction, has attracted significant interest because of its fundamental importance and potential applications. Optical losses are ubiquitous, which inherently suppress the photonic spin Hall shift (PSHS). In this work, we consider an atomic medium that exhibits both absorption and transparency to investigate and mitigate the effects of loss on PSHS. We demonstrate that laser-induced coherence in an atomic medium, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) at resonance, counteracts the detrimental effects of losses on the PSHS. Upon EIT in a coherent medium enclosed within dielectric slabs, the reflectivity of the incident polarized state is reduced near Brewster's angle to enhance PSHS. Moreover, the tunable refractive index of the atomic medium enables the manipulation of PSHS without structural modifications with a tiny loss. Our proposed loss-free approach to PSHS may enable advanced optical sensing and other spin-based applications.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary polarization retarders and polarization controllers, constructed from sequences of half-wave and quarter-wave plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically introduce several types of arbitrary polarization retarders constructed from sequences of half-wave and quarter-wave plates, each rotated at specific angles. By integrating these arbitrary polarization retarders with arbitrary polarization rotators, we develop a versatile device capable of performing arbitrary-to-arbitrary polarization transformations. While some of the proposed devices are documented in the literature, others are novel and, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously presented. The continuous adjustment of retardance and rotation in these devices is achieved by altering the relative orientation of the wave plates in the sequence.</description>

      <title>Low-loss far-infrared surface phonon polaritons in suspended SrTiO3 nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs), excitations arising from the coupling of light with lattice vibrations, enable light confinement and local field enhancement, which is essential for various photonic and thermal applications. To date, PhPs with high confinement and low loss have been mainly observed in the mid-infrared regime and mostly in manually exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of low-loss, thickness-tunable phonon polaritons in the far-infrared regime within transferable free-standing SrTiO3 membranes synthesized through a scalable approach, achieving high figures of merit, which are comparable to the previous record values from the vdW materials. Leveraging atomic precision in thickness control, large dimensions, and compatibility with mature oxide electronics, functional oxide membranes present a promising large-scale two-dimensional (2D) platform alternative to vdW materials for on-chip polaritonic technologies in the far-infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Neural Network for Metasurface Optical Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physics-constrained neural network is presented for predicting the optical response of metasurfaces. Our approach incorporates physical laws directly into the neural network architecture and loss function, addressing critical challenges in the modeling of metasurfaces. Unlike methods that require specialized weighting strategies or separate architectural branches to handle different data regimes and phase wrapping discontinuities, this unified approach effectively addresses phase discontinuities, energy conservation constraints, and complex gap-dependent behavior. We implement sine-cosine phase representation with Euclidean normalization as a non-trainable layer within the network, enabling the model to account for the periodic nature of phase while enforcing the mathematical constraint $\sin^2 \phi + \cos^2 \phi = 1$. A Euclidean distance-based loss function in the sine-cosine space ensures a physically meaningful error metric while preventing discontinuity issues. The model achieves good, consistent performance with small, imbalanced datasets of 580 and 1075 data points, compared to several thousand typically required by alternative approaches. This physics-informed approach preserves physical interpretability while reducing reliance on large datasets and could be extended to other photonic structures by incorporating additional physical constraints tailored to specific applications.</description>

      <title>On the interference of the scattered wave and the incident wave in light scattering problems with Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the light scattering problem for a Gaussian beam and a (spherical) particle at arbitrary location. Within the beam cross section, the total electromagnetic field is the superposition of the incident beam and the scattered wave. Using the Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theory (GLMT) as a vehicle to access such scattering problems, we discuss the mathematical modeling of this interference at short, large but finite and infinite distances from the scatterer. We show how to eliminate the errors that can arise from improper modeling in the most straight-forward manner, that is superimposing the scattered wave with the closed-form expression for the Gaussian beam at a finite distance from the particle. GLMT uses a low order beam model ($s^1$), but using the known higher order models ($s^3$, $s^5$, $s^7$, ...) would not mitigate these errors as we discuss. The challenge lies in an appropriate description of the Gaussian beam at arbitrary distances from its focus, not in its description on the scale of a particle (located in or near the focus) nor in the expressions for the scattered field. Hence, the solutions described here can readily be extended to light scattering frameworks other than GLMT and are thus also relevant for non-spherical particles.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Coherent Bandgap Modulation Probed by Parametric Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in crystals are powerful tools that seamlessly allow both functionalities of sizeable bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy. While we often assume that the border between the two regimes of modulation and detection is sharp and well-defined, there are experiments where the boundaries fade. The study of these transition regions allows us to identify the real potentials and inherent limitations of the most commonly used optical spectroscopy techniques. Here, we measure and explain the co-existence between bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy in the case of resonant perturbative nonlinear optics in an atomically thin direct gap semiconductor. We report a clear deviation from the typical quadratic power scaling of second-harmonic generation near an exciton resonance, and we explain this unusual result based on all-optical modulation driven by the intensity-dependent optical Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts in the $\pm$K valleys of the Brillouin zone. Our experimental results are corroborated by analytical and numerical analysis based on the semiconductor Bloch equations, from which we extract the resonant transition dipole moments and dephasing times of the used sample. These findings redefine the meaning of perturbative nonlinear optics by revealing how coherent light-matter interactions can modify the band structure of a crystal, even in the weak-field regime. Furthermore, our results strengthen the understanding of ultrafast all-optical control of electronic states in two-dimensional materials, with potential applications in valleytronics, Floquet engineering, and light-wave electronics.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of broken time-reversal symmetry in centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric atomically thin crystals with nonlinear Kerr rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry, together with space-inversion symmetry, is one of the defining properties of crystals, underlying phenomena such as magnetism, topology and non-trivial spin textures. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide an excellent tunable model system to study the interplay between time-reversal and space-inversion symmetry, since both can be engineered on demand by tuning the number of layers and via all-optical bandgap modulation. In this work, we modulate and study time-reversal symmetry using third harmonic Kerr rotation in mono- and bilayer TMDs. By illuminating the samples with elliptically polarized light, we achieve spin-selective bandgap modulation and consequent breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The reduced symmetry modifies the nonlinear susceptibility tensor, causing a rotation of the emitted third harmonic polarization. With this method, we are able to probe broken time-reversal symmetry in both non-centrosymmetric (monolayer) and centrosymmetric (bilayer) crystals. Furthermore, we discuss how the detected third harmonic rotation angle directly links to the spin-valley locking in monolayer TMDs and to the spin-valley-layer locking in bilayer TMDs. Thus, our results define a powerful approach to study broken time-reversal symmetry in crystals regardless of space-inversion symmetry, and shed light on the spin, valley and layer coupling of atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Enhancement in Refractive Index Sensing via Full-Spectrum Machine Learning Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full-spectrum machine learning framework for refractive index sensing using simulated absorption spectra from meta-grating structures composed of titanium or silicon nanorods under TE and TM polarizations. Linear regression was applied to 80 principal components extracted from each spectrum, and model performance was assessed using five-fold cross-validation, simulating real-world biosensing scenarios where unknown patient samples are predicted based on standard calibration data. Titanium-based structures, dominated by broadband intensity changes, yielded the lowest mean squared errors and the highest accuracy improvements: up to a 6065-fold reduction compared to the best single-feature model. In contrast, silicon-based structures, governed by narrow resonances, showed more modest gains due to spectral nonlinearity that limits the effectiveness of global linear models. We also show that even the best single-wavelength predictor is identified through data-driven analysis, not visual selection, highlighting the value of automated feature preselection. These findings demonstrate that spectral shape plays a key role in modeling performance and that full-spectrum linear approaches are especially effective for intensity-modulated index sensors.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for designs for ultrastable laser with $\mathbf{10^{-17}}$ fractional frequency instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lasers with long coherence time and narrow linewidth are an essential tool for quantum sensors and clocks. Ultrastable cavities and laser systems are now commercially available with fractional frequency instabilities in the mid $10^{-16}$ range. This document aims to provide technical guidance for researchers starting in the field of ultrastable lasers and to give an outlook toward the next generation of improved ultrastable lasers. These guidelines have arisen from the scope of the EMPIR project ``Next generation ultrastable lasers'' ( https://www.ptb.de/empir2021/nextlasers ) with contributions from the European project partners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the structure of single photons in the ultrafast domain is enabling new quantum information processing technologies. At the picosecond timescale, quantum information can be processed before decoherence can occur. In this work, we study the capabilities of few-mode cross-phase modulation via the optical Kerr effect, using ultrafast pulses. We observe a significant modulation in the spatial mode of structured photons on timescales $\leq 1.3$~ps.</description>

      <title>Scalable MHz-Rate Entanglement Distribution in Low-Latency Quantum Networks Interconnecting Heterogeneous Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency quantum networks between heterogeneous quantum information processors. Unfortunately, in a quantum network with homogeneous quantum processors, the theoretical entanglement distribution rate for a single channel is limited to the 100-kHz level with a millisecond-level reconfiguration latency, which is not sufficient for error-corrected distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture by introducing the concept of a reconfigurable quantum interface. In our protocol, through tuning the frequency and temporal mode of the photonic qubits to dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, a 4.5 MHz Bell pair distribution rate, with a potential of more than 40 MHz Bell pair rate, is achieved. Through the use of reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches, a nanosecond network reconfiguration latency can be demonstrated with low-loss, low-infidelity and high-dimensional switches. To the best of our knowledge, our architecture is the first practical solution that can accommodate the entanglement distribution between heterogeneous quantum nodes with a rate and latency that satisfy most distributed quantum circuits and error correction requirements. The proposed architecture is compatible with the industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Entangling quantum memories over 420 km in fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-distance entanglement is pivotal for quantum communication, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Significant progresses have been made in extending the distribution distance of entangled photons, either in free space or fiber. For future quantum network applications, matter-based entanglement is more favorable since the capability of storage is essential for advanced applications. Extending entanglement distance for memory qubits was partially hindered by the mismatch of its photonic emission wavelength with the low-loss transmission window of optical fiber. By incorporating quantum frequency conversion, memory-memory entanglement has been successfully extended to several tens of kilometers. Here, we make a significant step further by reporting the entanglement between two atomic ensemble quantum memories over 420 km. We convert photons emitted from the memories to telecom S-band, which enable us to exploit the significantly low transmission loss in fiber (0.17 dB/km). We employ the DLCZ scheme for remote entanglement generation, and delicately stabilize the relative phase between the two memories by using fulltime far-off-resonant locking to reduce high-frequency noise and intermittent dual-band locking to compensate low-frequency drift jointly. We demonstrate that the memory-memory entangling probability beats the repeaterless channel capacity for direct entanglement distribution. Our experiment provides a testbed of studying quantum network applications from metropolitan scale to intercity scale.</description>

      <title>A Message-Passing Perspective on Ptychographic Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic approach to ptychographic reconstruction in computational imaging. Ptychography is an imaging method where the complex amplitude of an object is estimated from a sequence of diffraction measurements. We formulate this reconstruction as a Bayesian inverse problem and derive an inference algorithm, termed "Ptycho-EP," based on belief propagation and Vector Approximate Message Passing from information theory. Prior knowledge about the unknown object can be integrated into the probabilistic model, and the Bayesian framework inherently provides uncertainty quantification of the reconstruction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, when the probe's illumination function is known, our algorithm accurately retrieves the object image at a sampling ratio approaching the information theoretic limit. In scenarios where the illumination function is unknown, both the object and the probe can be jointly reconstructed via an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm against conventional methods, highlighting its superior convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a giant-mode cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation thresholds. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of ($10^6$), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Information Bottleneck for Covert Quantum Target Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target sensing is a fundamental task with many practical applications, e.g.~in LiDaR and radar systems. Quantum strategies with entangled states can achieve better sensing accuracies with the same probe energy, yet it is often simpler to use classical probes with higher energy than to take advantage of the quantum regime. Recently, it has been shown that useful quantum advantage can be achieved in covert situations, where sensing has to be performed while also avoiding detection by an adversary: here increasing energy is not a viable stratagem, as it facilitates the adversary. In this paper we introduce a general framework to assess and quantify quantum advantage in covert situations. This is based on extending the information bottleneck principle, originally developed for communication and machine learning applications, to decision problems via the Chernoff information, with the ultimate goal of quantitatively optimizing the trade-off between covertness and sensing ability. In this context we show how quantum resources, namely entangled photonic probes paired with photon counting, greatly outperform classical coherent transmitters in target detection and ranging, while also maintaining a chosen level of covertness. Our work highlights the great potential of integrating quantum sensing in LiDAR systems to enhance the covert performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplexing information in different degrees of freedom and use of integrated and fiber-optic components are natural solutions to the scalability bottleneck in optical quantum communications and computing. However, for bulk-optics systems, where size, cost, stability, and reliability are factors, this remains either impractical or highly challenging to implement. In this paper we present a framework to engineer continuous-variable entanglement produced through nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion in \chi^(2) nonlinear photonic lattices in spatial and spectral degrees of freedom that can solve the scalability challenge. We show how spatio-spectral pump shaping produce cluster states that are naturally distributable in quantum communication networks and a resource for measurement-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Extracting Complete Resonance Characteristics From the Phase of Physical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonances are common in wave physics and their full and rigorous characterization is crucial to correctly tailor the response of a system in both time and frequency domains. However, they have been conventionally described by the quality factor, a real-valued number quantifying the sharpness of a single peak in the amplitude spectrum, and associated with a singularity in the complex frequency plane. But the amplitude of a physical signal does not hold all the information on the resonance and it has not been established that even the knowledge of the full distribution of singularities carries this information. Here we derive a dimensionless quality function that fully characterizes resonances from the knowledge of the phase spectrum of the signal. This function is driven by the spectral derivative of the phase. It is equivalent to the imaginary part of the Wigner-Smith time delay but it has the advantage of being valid for arbitrary response functions, including the components of the S-matrix. The spectral derivative of the phase can be calculated numerically from simulations or experimental acquisitions of the phase spectrum. Alternatively, it can be retrieved from the distribution of poles and zeros in the complex frequency plane through an analytic expression, which demonstrates that singularities do not suffice to fully characterize the resonances and that both singularities and zeros must be taken into account to retrieve the quality function. This approach permits to extract all the characteristics of resonances from arbitrary spectral response functions without a priori knowledge on the physical system.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Coherent Diffractive Imaging via Titled-Incidence Multi-Rotation-Angle Fusion Ptychography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) enables lensless imaging with experimental simplicity and a flexible field of view, yet its resolution is fundamentally constrained by the Abbe diffraction limit. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Tilted-Incidence Multi-Rotation-Angle Fusion Ptychography technique. This approach leverages a tilted-incidence geometry to extend the collection angle beyond the Abbe limit, achieving up to a -fold resolution enhancement. By acquiring diffraction patterns at multiple sample rotation angles, we capture complementary spatial frequency information. A tilted-incidence multi-rotation-angle fusion ptychographic iterative engine (tmf-PIE) algorithm is then employed to integrate these datasets, enabling super-resolution image reconstruction. Additionally, this method mitigates the anisotropic resolution artifacts inherent to tilted CDI geometries. Our technique represents a novel advancement in super-resolution imaging, providing a novel alternative alongside established methods such as STED, SIM, and SMLM.</description>

      <title>Image Reconstruction from Readout-Multiplexed Single-Photon Detector Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Readout multiplexing is a promising solution to overcome hardware limitations and data bottlenecks in imaging with single-photon detectors. Conventional multiplexed readout processing creates an upper bound on photon counts at a very fine time scale, where frames with multiple detected photons must either be discarded or allowed to introduce significant bias. We formulate multiphoton coincidence resolution as an inverse imaging problem and introduce a solution framework to probabilistically resolve the spatial locations of photon incidences. Specifically, we develop a theoretical abstraction of row--column multiplexing and a model of photon events that make readouts ambiguous. Using this, we propose a novel estimator that spatially resolves up to four coincident photons. Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed method increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of reconstruction by 3 to 4 dB compared to conventional methods under optimal incident flux conditions. Additionally, this method reduces the required number of readout frames to achieve the same mean-squared error as other methods by a factor of ~4. Finally, our method matches the Cramer--Rao bound for detection probability estimation for a wider range of incident flux values compared to conventional methods. While demonstrated for a specific detector type and readout architecture, this method can be extended to more general multiplexing with different detector models.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at an avoided crossing near the exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>
