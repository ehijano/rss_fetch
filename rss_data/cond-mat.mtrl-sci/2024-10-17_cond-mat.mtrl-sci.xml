      <title>Influence of pressure on the kinetics of ferroelectric phase transition in BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferroelectric phase transition in barium titanate under pressure was studied within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg theory using differential scanning calorimetry. An innovative method for high-sensitive thermal measurements under pressure was demonstrated. It was shown that the relaxation process proceeds nonmonotonically with the formation of intermediate short-lived phases. It was established that polydomain ordering is preferred but the monodomenization of the sample is possible under certain conditions. A narrowing of the temperature hysteresis with increasing pressure was revealed. A new tricritical point in barium titanate crystals characterizing the changing of the phase transition has been experimentally determined and theoretically confirmed.</description>

      <title>Pressure-thermal hysteresis phenomena in BaTiO3 upon phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase transition into the ferroelectric phase in barium titanate occurs in many stages with the appearance of nonlinear phenomena. The mixed nature of the transition: displacive and order-disorder type, causes the occurrence of a thermal hysteresis, which span depends significantly on the pressure imposed on the sample. Theoretical calculations performed within the framework of Landau phenomenological theory showed a nonlinear dynamics of the thermal hysteresis with pressure. The existence of unusual relaxation phenomena was predicted in the pressure range of 130-145 MPa. Experimental and theoretical studies have shown the periods of slowing down of the domain structure upon the evolution process, the duration of which depends on the pressure and quenching temperature. It was assumed that relaxation processes near the tricritical point are similar to those observed near the Curie temperature. Theoretically, the parameters recommended for further experiments using high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry were calculated.</description>

      <title>Pressure effect on the formation kinetics of ferroelectric domain structure uner first order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg theory the kinetics of domain structure formation in ferroelectrics that undergo first order phase transition was investigated under the influence of hydrostatic pressure. It was established that mechanical action increases the tendency of nonequilibrium system to the formation of stable polydomain structure. Numerical analysis showed that the process of domain ordering can proceed both directly and with formation of short-living metastable polydomain phase. It was found that the incubation period of domain structure formation can be observed at the initial stage of relaxation. Using the KNO3 crystal as an example, it was shown that the time of evolution of the system to the thermodynamic equilibrium is inversely proportional to the pressure value. It was established that in KDP crystals near phase transition point (TC-T&lt;10K) the hydrostatic pressure induces the destruction of ferroelectric ordering. It was shown that the value of critical pressure pcr increases with the growth of quenching temperature.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nanoscale Photoresponse Mechanisms for Enhanced Photothermoelectric Effects in van der Waals Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photodetectors are crucial for their high speed, sensitivity, and efficient power consumption. In these devices, photocurrent generation is primarily attributed to the photovoltaic (PV) effect, driven by electron hole separations, and the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect, which results from temperature gradients via the Seebeck effect. As devices shrink, the overlap of these mechanisms-both dependent on the Fermi level and band structure-complicates their separate evaluation at the nanoscale. This study introduces a novel 3D photocurrent nano-imaging technique specifically designed to distinctly map these mechanisms in a Schottky barrier photodiode featuring a molybdenum disulfide and gold (MoS2 Au) interface. We uncover a significant PTE-dominated region extending several hundred nanometers from the electrode edge, a characteristic facilitated by the weak electrostatic forces typical in 2D materials. Unexpectedly, we find that incorporating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), known for its high thermal conductivity, markedly enhances the PTE response. This counterintuitive enhancement stems from an optimal overlap between thermal and Seebeck profiles, presenting a new pathway to boost device performance. Our findings highlight the capability of this imaging technique to not only advance optoelectronic applications but also to deepen our understanding of light matter interactions within low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Coupling Model of Optical Conductivity in Mixed-Valence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Linear Response Theory, with appropriate wave functions and energies from perturbation method, the absorption profiles can be calculated for all three classes of mixed-valence systems as defined by Robin and Day : Class III (delocalized), Class I (localized) and Class II (intermediate between III and I). Based on these absorption profiles, one can calculate the corresponding frequency-dependent optical conductivity profiles with the following results: For all three classes, the optical conductivity profiles are similar to their corresponding absorption profiles in regard to band shape and polarization, except peaks of these profiles tend to shift toward higher frequency with respect to the absorption profiles. The charge transfer absorption (CT band) is the major contributors of optical conductivity. Moreover, the CT-induced IR band, also contributes to optical conductivity, as it borrows its intensity from the CT band and the amount of borrowing depends on its proximity to the latter, as in Class II.</description>

      <title>Suppressed paramagnetism in amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ oxides and its link to superconducting qubit performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced transmon qubit $T_1$ coherence times have been linked to the amorphous oxide layers formed by thin film capacitors during processing. Because Ta or Ta capped Nb capacitors exhibit overall superior qubit performance to those fabricated with Nb capacitors, it has been hypothesized that the amorphous, non-stoichiometric Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ oxide is less lossy than its Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ counterpart. The origins of what makes amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ less susceptible to accepted decoherence channels is unknown. Here we establish the microscopic features of amorphous Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ and Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ using a combination of \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations. Our simulations establish that oxygen deficiency is less likely to occur in amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ than in Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ for $0\le x \le 0.25$ and that at a given level of oxygen deficiency the formation of metal Ta-Ta bonds is enhanced. These bonds, which are accommodated by structural flaws in the amorphous network, capture electrons better than in amorphous Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$. These thermochemical differences quench or highly suppress magnetic moments in amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ and eliminate a potential source of quasiparticles and magnetic flux noise. Our calculations also show that hyperfine couplings between Nb nuclei and local magnetic moments in Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ could form "two-level systems" (TLS) or "two-level fluctuators" (TLF) with energy splittings of 100-1000 MHz or higher. This reveals a new TLS mechanism in amorphous Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ oxide layers that is unlikely in Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$. Our work provides fundamental understanding of the materials chemistry and limitations imposed by native oxides of superconducting qubits, which can be used to guide materials selection and processing.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Creation of Identical Monochromatic Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic creation of quantum emitters with high single-photon-purity and excellent indistinguishability is essential for practical applications in quantum information science. Many successful attempts have been carried out in hexagonal boron nitride showing its capability of hosting room temperature quantum emitters. However, most of the existing methods produce emitters with heterogeneous optical properties and unclear creation mechanisms. Here, the authors report a deterministic creation of identical room temperature quantum emitters using masked-carbon-ion implantation on freestanding hBN flakes. Quantum emitters fabricated by our approach showed thermally limited monochromaticity with an emission center wavelength distribution of 590.7 +- 2.7 nm, a narrow full width half maximum of 7.1 +- 1.7 nm, excellent brightness (1MHz emission rate), and extraordinary stability. Our method provides a reliable platform for characterization and fabrication research on hBN based quantum emitters, helping to reveal the origins of the single-photon-emission behavior in hBN and favoring practical applications, especially the industrial-scale production of quantum technology.</description>

      <title>A TEM Study of MOCVD-Grown Rutile GeO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors are promising for next-generation power electronics, largely attributed to their substantial bandgap and exceptional breakdown electric field. Rutile GeO2 (r-GeO2) emerges as a promising alternative, particularly because of its ambipolar dopability. However, research on r-GeO2 is still in its infancy, and further investigation into its structural properties is essential for enhancing epilayer quality. In our previous work, we identified distinct surface morphologies; square-patterned and smooth regions of epitaxial r-GeO2 films grown on r-TiO2 (001) substrates using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).This research employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the structural characteristics of the material. The findings indicate that the square-patterned regions are crystalline, whereas the smooth regions exhibit amorphous properties. The measured lattice spacing in the (110) plane is 0.324 nm, slightly exceeding the theoretical value of 0.312 nm. This discrepancy suggests the presence of tensile strain in the r-GeO2 film, resulting from lattice mismatch or thermal expansion differences with the substrate. We also observed a threading dislocation density of 1.83*10^9 cm-2, consisting of 11.76% screw-type, 29.41% edge-type, 55.89% mixed-type dislocations, and 2.94% planar defects. These findings offer valuable insights into the growth mechanisms and defect characteristics of r-GeO2.</description>

      <title>Correlated proton disorder in the crystal structure of the double hydroxide perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CuSn(OH)$_6$ is a quantum spin system from the family of magnetic double perovskite hydroxides, having a frustrated magnetic sublattice. It is also known as the natural mineral mushistonite, whose crystal structure has remained elusive for decades. Here we employ x-ray and neutron powder diffraction to solve the crystal structure of CuSn(OH)$_6$ and propose a structure model in the orthorhombic space group $Pnnn$ with correlated proton disorder. The occupation of the hydrogen sites in the structure is constrained by ``ice rules'' similar to those known for water ice. The resulting frustration of the hydrogen bonding network is likely to have a complex and interesting interplay with the strong magnetic frustration expected in the face-centred magnetic sublattice. Structural distortions, which are quite pronounced in Cu$^{2+}$ compounds due to the Jahn-Teller effect, partially alleviate both types of frustration. We also show that hydrostatic pressure tends to suppress proton disorder through a sequence of proton-ordering transitions, as some of the split hydrogen sites merge already at 1.75 GPa while others show a tendency toward possible merging at higher pressures.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonons, Localization and Slow Polaron Formation in Lead-free Gold Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free metal halide perovskites are emerging as less-toxic alternatives to their lead-based counterparts. However, their applicability in optoelectronic devices is limited, and the charge transport dynamics remain poorly understood. Understanding photo-induced charge and structural dynamics is critical for unlocking the potential of these novel systems. In this work, we employ ultrafast optical and Raman spectroscopy combined with band structure calculations to investigate the coupled electronic and vibrational dynamics in Caesium gold bromide, a promising lead-free perovskite. We find that the band-edge charge transfer states are strongly coupled to Au-Br stretching phonon modes, leading to frequency modulation of absorption by impulsively excited coherent phonons. Early-stage relaxation is characterized by dynamics of delocalized charge transfer excitation and slowly decaying coherent phonons. The electronic and vibrational relaxation reveals a slow formation of a localized polaronic state in the 10-20 ps timescale. Using a displaced harmonic oscillator model, the polaronic binding energy is estimated to be ~80 meV following lattice relaxation along the phonon modes. Strong exciton-phonon coupling and slow polaron formation via coupling to lattice modes make this material a promising testbed for the control of coherent phonons and localized polaronic states using light.</description>

      <title>Lattice thermal conductivity in the anharmonic overdamped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystalline materials, low lattice thermal conductivity is often associated with strong anharmonicity, which can cause significant deviations from the expected Lorentzian lineshape of phonon spectral functions. These deviations, occurring in an overdamped regime, raise questions about the applicability of the Boltzmann transport equation. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can trigger structural phase transitions with temperature, which cannot be adequately described by the standard harmonic approximation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for computing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our method combines the Green-Kubo linear response theory with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The latter allows us to describe the temperature-dependent evolution of the crystal structure, including first- and second-order phase transitions, as well as the vibrational properties in highly anharmonic materials. The Green-Kubo method considers the entire lineshapes of phonon spectral functions in the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity, thus eliminating the questionable use of phonon lifetimes in the overdamped regime, as well as naturally including coherent transport effects. Additionally, we extend our theory to model complex dynamical lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing our understanding of time-dependent thermoreflectance experiments. As a practical application, we employ this approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of CsPbBr$_3$, a complex crystal known for its anomalous thermal transport behavior with a complex phase diagram. Our method is able to determine the thermal conductivity across different phases in good agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Million-atom heat transport simulations of polycrystalline graphene approaching first-principles accuracy enabled by neuroevolution potential on desktop GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles molecular dynamics simulations of heat transport in systems with large-scale structural features are challenging due to their high computational cost. Here, using polycrystalline graphene as a case study, we demonstrate the feasibility of simulating heat transport with near first-principles accuracy in systems containing over 1.4 million atoms, achievable even with consumer desktop GPUs. This is enabled by the highly efficient neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach, as implemented in the open-source GPUMD package. Leveraging the NEP model's accuracy and efficiency, we quantify the reduction in thermal conductivity of polycrystalline graphene due to grain boundaries with varying grain sizes, resolving contributions from in-plane and out-of-plane (flexural) phonon modes. Additionally, we find that grain boundaries can lead to finite thermal conductivity even under significant tensile strain, in contrast to the divergent behavior observed in pristine graphene under similar conditions, indicating that grain boundaries may play a crucial role in thermal transport in low-dimensional momentum-conserving systems. These findings could offer insights for interpreting experimental observations, given the widespread presence of both large-scale grain boundaries and external strains in real materials. The demonstrated ability to simulate millions of atoms with near-first-principles accuracy on consumer desktop GPUs using the NEP approach will help make large-scale high-fidelity atomistic simulations more accessible to the broader research community.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Magnetic Coupling in FePS$_{3}$ and NiPS$_{3}$ Stacked Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single layers of transition-metal thiophosphates (2D-TMPS$_{3}$) van der Waals magnets are an ideal platform for studying antiferromagnetic interactions in two dimensions. However, the magnetic coupling mechanism between two or more individual layers of these materials remains mostly unexplored. This study presents a density-functional based analysis and analytical models to describe the magnetic configurations of FePS$_{3}$ and NiPS$_{3}$ stacked bilayers. We explore the interplay between magnetic configurations and stacking shift, therefore identifying the mechanisms that result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling between layers. Our findings indicate that the stacking with the lowest energy is metal-dependent, and the interlayer magnetic configuration (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) varies based on the stacking type and the metal involved. Using an Ising-Hamiltonian model and a tight-binding model based on Wannier functions, we show that interlayer exchange interactions must be considered up to the third nearest neighbor and to elucidate the superexchange mechanism for the NiPS$_{3}$ system.</description>

      <title>Graphendofullerene: a novel molecular two-dimensional ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon chemistry has attracted a lot of attention by chemists, physicists and material scientists in the last decades. The recent discovery of graphullerene provides a promising platform for many applications due to its exceptional electronic properties and the possibility to host molecules or clusters inside the fullerene units. Herein, we introduce graphendofullerene, a novel molecular-based two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material formed by trimetallic nitrides clusters encapsulated on graphullerene. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the successful incorporation of the molecules into the 2D network formed by C$_{80}$ fullerenes, which leads to a robust long-range ferromagnetic order with a Curie temperature (Tc) of 38 K. Additionally, we achieve a 45% increase in Tc by strain engineering. These findings open the way for a new family of molecular 2D magnets based on graphendofullerene for advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Terahertz resonant emission by optically excited infrared-active shear phonons in KY(MoO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of the monochromatic electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz (THz) range of frequencies for many decades remanes a chellenging task. Here we demonstrate the emission of monochromatic sub-THz radiation by coherent optical phonons in dielectric material KY(MoO4)2. The layered crystal structure of KY(MoO4)2 leads to infrared-active shear lattice vibrations with energies below 3.7 meV, which corresponds to the frequencies low than 900 GHz where solid-state compounds based monochromatic radiation sources are rare. Coherent infrared-active optical phonons are excited by broadband THz pulses lasting for tens of picoseconds and re-emit narrow-band subTHz radiation pulses with a decay time of 33 picoseconds, which is exceptionally long for the oscillators with frequencies below 1 THz. Such a long coherent emission allows for the detection of more than 50 periods of radiation with frequencies of 568 and 860 GHz. The remarkably long decay time together with the chemical stability of the employed materials suggest a variety of possible applications in THz laser technology.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Automated Alloy Design with Graph Neural Network-Powered LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-agent AI model is used to automate the discovery of new metallic alloys, integrating multimodal data and external knowledge including insights from physics via atomistic simulations. Our multi-agent system features three key components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and planning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that dynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI agents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of MPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic potential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw dislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these atomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force calculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for physics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by reducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct all-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the dynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates vast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material properties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by several computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of advanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex systems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.</description>

      <title>Predicting synthesis window of beta-TaON with thermodynamic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-pure synthesis has been a major challenge for metal oxynitrides due to their sensitivity to synthesis conditions and the limited understanding of the underlying thermodynamics. The beta-phase tantalum oxynitride (beta-TaON), a promising material for applications in photocatalysis and energy storage, is particularly difficult to synthesize in a reproducible, phase-pure form. In this work, a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validation is presented to evaluate the phase-pure synthesis conditions for beta-TaON via ammonolysis reactions. The finite-temperature thermochemical properties of the reactant, product, and byproduct phases are predicted via first-principles calculations with the quasi-harmonic approach (QHA) as well as implemented from available thermodynamic databases. With the thermochemical properties, a thermodynamic model based on the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPAHD) approach is developed to assess the phase equilibria associated with the synthesis reactions and correspondingly predict the synthesis window for beta-TaON. A three-dimensional phase diagram is predicted as a function of gas composition and temperature, providing insights into optimal synthesis conditions. The computational predictions are further compared with available experimental data, offering a systematic framework for phase-pure beta-TaON synthesis.</description>

      <title>Navigation maps of the material space for automated self-driving labs of the future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of self-driving labs promising to synthesize large numbers of new materials, new automated tools are required for checking potential duplicates in existing structural databases before a material can be claimed as novel. To avoid duplication, we rigorously define the novelty metric of any periodic material as the smallest distance to its nearest neighbor among already known materials.
  Using ultra-fast structural invariants, all such nearest neighbors can be found within seconds on a typical computer even if a given crystal is disguised by changing a unit cell, perturbing atoms, or replacing chemical elements. This real-time novelty check is demonstrated by finding near-duplicates of the 43 materials produced by Berkeley's A-lab in the world's largest collections of inorganic structures, the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Project.
  To help future self-driving labs successfully identify novel materials, we propose navigation maps of the materials space where any new structure can be quickly located by its invariant descriptors similar to a geographic location on Earth.</description>

      <title>Multihyperuniformity in high entropy MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MXenes are a large family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides that possess excellent electrical conductivity, high volumetric capacitance, great mechanical properties, and hydrophilicity. In this work, we generalize the concept of multihyperuniformity (MH), an exotic state that can exist in a disordered multi-component system, to two-dimensional materials MXenes. Disordered hyperuniform systems possess an isotropic local structure that lacks traditional translational and orientational order, yet they completely suppress infinite-wavelength density fluctuations as in perfect crystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range order. In particular, we evaluate the static structure factor of the individual components present in the high entropy (HE) MXene experimental sample TiVCMoCr based on high-solution SEM imaging data, which suggests this HE MXene system is at least effectively multihyperuniform. We then devise a packing algorithm to generate multihyperuniform models of HE MXene systems. The MH HE MXenes are predicted to be energetically more stable compared to the prevailing (quasi)random models of the HE MXenes due to the hidden long-range order. Moreover, the MH structure exhibits a distinctly smaller lattice distortion, which has a vital effect on the electronic properties of HE MXenes, such as the density of states and charge distribution. This systematic study of HE MXenes strengthens our fundamental understanding of these systems, and suggests possible exotic physical properties, as endowed by the multihyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>High-temperature ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity in ultraflexible atomically thin square-shaped lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of high-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic ordering, large magnetic anisotropy, along with novel mechanical properties such as ferroelasticity and flexibility, in experimental feasible two-dimensional (2D) crystals is greatly appealing for nanoscale spintronics. However, the progress in identifying such materials is limited. Here, by first-principles calculations, we report the findings of an extraordinary combination of the above qualities for the first time in a new 2D exfoliated FeSi nanosheet in the P4/nmm space group. Due to the strong anion-mediated superexchange interaction, the monolayer FeSi (ML-FeSi) exhibits a Curie temperature Tc as high as 830 K, surpassing the current experimental record (344 K for ML-Cr3Te4). Furthermore, including FeSi, such isostructural lattices all demonstrate exceptional softness, as evidenced by their ultra-low in-plane stiffness. Remarkably, the transition metal atom and square-shaped crystal form work together to give this family of ML materials unique properties that can transition from Ising-like 2D ferromagnets in FeSi, MnP, MnAs, CrP, FeI, and VAs to 2D-XY ones in CrAs, VP, and multiferroic MnGe and TiTe. Overall, our work highlights such 2D lattices as promising candidates in emerging multifunctional device applications and nontrivial topological spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a full-field imaging technique for non-destructive 3D mapping of orientation and strain in crystalline elements. The new DFXM beamline at ID03, developed as part of the ESRF Phase II Upgrade Project (EBSL2), was designed to provide cutting-edge capabilities for studying embedded microstructures. The project relocated and upgraded the end station from ID06-HXM to ID03, integrating new X-ray optics, radiation hutches, and a source device optimized for this advanced technique. Notable improvements include a near-field camera, a new goniometer, and a high-resolution far-field camera. The conceptual design was completed in September 2019, followed by the technical design in March 2021, with first users welcomed in April 2024. Building on the success of the original instrument, the ID03 beamline offers enhanced multi-scale and multi-modal mapping of microstructures with high resolution, enabling in-situ exploration of complex phenomena. Applications range from strain and orientation mapping in metals to studies of functional materials, semiconductors, biominerals, and energy systems.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of functional 3D nanoarchitectures via atomic layer deposition on DNA origami crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While DNA origami is a powerful bottom-up fabrication technique, the physical and chemical stability of DNA nanostructures is generally limited to aqueous buffer conditions. Wet chemical silicification can stabilise these structures but does not add further functionality. Here, we demonstrate a versatile 3D nanofabrication technique to conformally coat micrometre-sized DNA origami crystals with functional metal oxides via atomic layer deposition (ALD). In addition to depositing homogenous and conformal nanometre-thin ZnO, TiO2, and IrO2 (multi)layers inside SiO2-stablised crystals, we establish a method to directly coat bare DNA crystals with ALD layers while maintaining the crystal integrity, enabled by critical point drying and low ALD process temperatures. As a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrate electrocatalytic water oxidation using ALD IrO2-coated DNA origami crystals, resulting in improved performance relative to planar films. Overall, our coating strategy establishes a tool set for designing custom-made 3D nanomaterials with precisely defined topologies and material compositions, combining the unique advantages of DNA origami and atomically controlled deposition of functional inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamic Electronic Properties of Weyl Semimetal NbP -- A Single Crystal $^{93}$Nb-NMR Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have been used to study the static and dynamic microscopic properties of the Weyl semimetal NbP. From a complete analysis of the angular dependence of the $^{93}$Nb-NMR spectra in a single crystal, the parameters for the electric quadrupole interactions and the magnetic hyperfine interactions were determined to be $\nu_{\rm Q} = 0.61$\,MHz, $\eta = 0.20$, $(K_{XX}, K_{YY}, K_{ZZ}) = (- 0.06, 0.11, - 0.11)$\% at 4.5\,K. The temperature and field dependence of the $^{93}$Nb Knight shift revealed a characteristic feature of the shape of the density of states with nearly massless fermions. We clearly observed a quantum oscillation of the Knight shift associated with the band structure, whose frequency was in good agreement with the previous bulk measurements. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1 / T_{1} T$, showed an almost constant behavior for $30 &lt; T &lt; 180$\,K, while a weak temperature dependence was observed below $\sim 30$\,K. This contrasts with the behavior observed in TaP and TaAs, where the $1 / T_{1} T$ measured by the $^{181}$Ta nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) shows $1 / T_{1} T \propto T^{2}$ and $T^{4}$ above approximately 30\,K. In TaP, the temperature dependent orbital hyperfine interaction plays a signficant role in nuclear relaxation, whereas this contribution is not observed in TaAs. Two-component spin echo oscillations were observed. The shorter-period oscillation is attributed to the origin of quadrupole coupling, while the longer-period oscillation indicates the presence of indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling, as discussed in other Weyl semimetal like TaP.</description>

      <title>Automated Model Discovery for Tensional Homeostasis: Constitutive Machine Learning in Growth and Remodeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft biological tissues exhibit a tendency to maintain a preferred state of tensile stress, known as tensional homeostasis, which is restored even after external mechanical stimuli. This macroscopic behavior can be described using the theory of kinematic growth, where the deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into an elastic part and a part related to growth and remodeling. Recently, the concept of homeostatic surfaces was introduced to define the state of homeostasis and the evolution equations for inelastic deformations.
  However, identifying the optimal model and material parameters to accurately capture the macroscopic behavior of inelastic materials can only be accomplished with significant expertise, is often time-consuming, and prone to error, regardless of the specific inelastic phenomenon. To address this challenge, built-in physics machine learning algorithms offer significant potential.
  In this work, we extend our inelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (iCANNs) by incorporating kinematic growth and homeostatic surfaces to discover the scalar model equations, namely the Helmholtz free energy and the pseudo potential. The latter describes the state of homeostasis in a smeared sense. We evaluate the ability of the proposed network to learn from experimentally obtained tissue equivalent data at the material point level, assess its predictive accuracy beyond the training regime, and discuss its current limitations when applied at the structural level.
  Our source code, data, examples, and an implementation of the corresponding material subroutine are made accessible to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13946282.</description>

Abstract: Long-range interactions are crucial in determining the behavior of chemical systems in various environments. Accurate predictions of physical and chemical phenomena at the atomic level hinge on accurate modeling of these interactions. Here, we present a framework that substantially enhances the predictive power of machine learning interatomic potentials by incorporating explicit polarizable long-range interactions with an equivariant graph neural network short-range potential. The pretrained universal model, applicable across the entire periodic table, can achieve first-principles accuracy. This versatile model has been further applied to diverse areas of research, including the study of mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes, ferroelectricity, and interfacial reactions, demonstrating its broad applicability and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have redefined lighting with their environment-friendliness and flexibility. However, only 25 % of the electronic states of organic molecules can emit light upon electrical excitation, limiting the overall efficiency of OLEDs. Strong light-matter coupling, achieved by confining light within OLEDs using mirrors, creates hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons, which could "activate" the remaining 75 % electronic triplet states. Here, we study triplet-to-polariton transition and derive rates for both reverse inter-system crossing and triplet-triplet annihilation. In addition, we explore how the harmful singlet-singlet annihilation could be reduced with strong coupling.</description>

Abstract: High-cycle fatigue is a critical performance metric of structural alloys for many applications. The high cost, time, and labor involved in experimental fatigue testing call for efficient and accurate computer models of fatigue life. We present FIP-GNN -- a graph neural network for polycrystals that (i) predicts fatigue indicator parameters as grain-level inelastic responses to cyclic loading quantifying the local driving force for crack initiation and (ii) generalizes these predictions to large microstructure volume elements with grain populations well beyond those used in training. These advances can make significant contributions to statistically rigorous and computationally efficient modeling of high-cycle fatigue -- a long-standing challenge in the field.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Boosted Entropy-Engineered Synthesis of CuCo Nanometric Solid Solution Alloys for Near-100% Nitrate-to-Ammonia Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanometric solid solution alloys are utilized in a broad range of fields, including catalysis, energy storage, medical application, and sensor technology. Unfortunately, the synthesis of these alloys becomes increasingly challenging as the disparity between the metal elements grows, due to differences in atomic sizes, melting points, and chemical affinities. This study utilized a data-driven approach incorporating sample balancing enhancement techniques and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms to improve the model's ability to handle imbalanced data, significantly boosting the efficiency of experimental parameter optimization. Building on this enhanced data processing framework, we developed an entropy-engineered synthesis approach specifically designed to produce stable, nanometric copper and cobalt (CuCo) solid solution alloys. Under conditions of -0.425 V (vs. RHE), the CuCo alloy exhibited nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) and a high ammonia production rate of 232.17 mg h-1 mg-1. Stability tests in a simulated industrial environment showed that the catalyst maintained over 80% FE and an ammonia production rate exceeding 170 mg h-1 mg-1 over a testing period of 120 hours, outperforming most reported catalysts. To delve deeper into the synergistic interaction mechanisms between Cu and Co, in situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized for realtime monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further substantiated our findings. These results not only highlight the exceptional catalytic performance of the CuCo alloy but also reflect the effective electronic and energy interactions between the two metals.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium chemical short-range order in metallic alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a ''new knob'' to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus by the Field-Induced Partitioning of Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To search for a conceptual picture describing the magnetization plateau phenomenon, we surveyed the crystal structures and the spin lattices of those magnets exhibiting plateaus in their magnetization vs. magnetic field curves by probing the three questions: (a) why only certain magnets exhibit magnetization plateaus, (b) why there occur several different types of magnetization plateaus, and (c) what controls the widths of magnetization plateaus. We show that the answers to these questions lie in how the magnets under field absorb Zeeman energy hence changing their magnetic structures. The magnetic structure of a magnet insulator is commonly described in terms of its spin lattice, which requires the determination of the spin exchanges nonnegligible strengths between the magnetic ions. Our work strongly suggests that a magnet under magnetic field partitions its spin lattice into antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic fragments by breaking its weak magnetic bonds. Our supposition of the field-induced partitioning of spin lattice into magnetic fragments is supported by the anisotropic magnetization plateaus of Ising magnets and by the highly anisotropic width of the 1/3-magnetization plateau in azurite. The answers to the three questions (a) - (c) emerge naturally by analyzing how these fragments are formed under magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Constraint Integration for Simultaneously Optimizing Crystal Structures with Multiple Targeted Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In materials science, finding crystal structures that have targeted properties is crucial. While recent methodologies such as Bayesian optimization and deep generative models have made some advances on this issue, these methods often face difficulties in adaptively incorporating various constraints, such as electrical neutrality and targeted properties optimization, while keeping the desired specific crystal structure. To address these challenges, we have developed the Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which utilizes state-of-the-art property prediction models and their gradients to directly optimize input crystal structures for targeted properties simultaneously. SMOACS enables the integration of adaptive constraints into the optimization process without necessitating model retraining. Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously optimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even with models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap optimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining electrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites, where the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging. The properties of the most promising materials have been confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Revealing Fano Resonance in Dirac Materials ZrTe5 through Raman Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Fano resonance in ZrTe5, using Raman scattering measurements. We identified two closely spaced B2g phonon modes, B2g I and B2g II, around 9 meV and 10 meV, respectively. Interestingly, only B2g I exhibited the Fano resonance, an outcome of quantum interference between discrete phonon modes and continuous electronic excitations. This is consistent with the much stronger electron-phonon coupling of B2g I mode demonstrated by first-principles calculations. Additionally, temperature-dependent measurements highlight an enhanced Fano asymmetry at elevated temperatures, originating from the thermal effect on the joint electron-hole density of states. This study offers insights into the complex interrelation of electron-phonon coupling, thermal effect, and Fano resonances in ZrTe5.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a long-ranged charge order with 1/4 Ge1-dimerization in an antiferromagnetic Kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exotic quantum states arise from the interplay of various degrees of freedom such as charge, spin, orbital, and lattice. Recently, a novel short-ranged charge order (CO) was discovered deep inside the antiferromagnetic phase of Kagome magnet FeGe, exhibiting close relationships with magnetism. Despite extensive investigations, the CO mechanism remains controversial, mainly because the short-ranged behavior hinders precise identification of CO superstructure. Here, combining multiple experimental techniques, we report the observation of a long-ranged CO in high-quality FeGe samples, which is accompanied with a first-order structural transition. With these high-quality samples, the distorted 2 * 2 * 2 CO superstructure is characterized by a strong dimerization along the c-axis of 1/4 of Ge1-sites in Fe3Ge layers, and in response to that, the 2 * 2 in-plane charge modulations are induced. Moreover, we show that the previously reported short-ranged CO might be related to large occupational disorders at Ge1-site, which upsets the equilibrium of the CO state and the ideal 1 * 1 * 1 structure with very close energies, inducing nanoscale coexistence of these two phases.Our study provides crucial clues for further understanding the CO properties in FeGe and helps to identify the CO mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively predicting angle-resolved polarized Raman intensity of black phosphorus flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose two strategies to determine complex refractive indexes along armchair and zigzag axes for BP flakes, aiming in predicting angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) intensity by explicitly considering birefringence, linear dichroism, and anisotropic cavity interference effects within multilayered structures. By leveraging this methodology, we have identified the intrinsic complex Raman tensors for phonon modes of BP flakes, independent of BP flake thickness (&gt;20 nm). We also elucidated the flake thickness-dependent effective complex Raman tensor elements, allowing for precise prediction of the observed ARPR intensity profile for specific BP flake. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes deposited on dielectric substrate to determine the Raman tensors for fully predicting their ARPR response.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>LifeGPT: Topology-Agnostic Generative Pretrained Transformer Model for Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero-energy flat-bands and intrinsic magnetism in carbon monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat-band in twisted graphene bilayer has garnered widespread attention, and whether flat-bands can be realized in carbon monolayer is an interesting topic worth exploring in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate that, based on the theory of compact localized states, a series of two-dimensional carbon allotropes with flat-bands can be achieved. Two of them named as 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 and 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 are confirmed to be dynamically stable carbon phases with isolated or weakly overlapped flat-bands at the Fermi-level. The maximum Fermi velocities of the flat-band electrons are evaluated to be 1x10^4 m/s and 0.786x10^4 m/s, both of which are lower than the Fermi velocity of the flat-band electrons in magic-angle graphene (4x10^4 m/s). Furthermore, 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 has been confirmed to be a flat-band related magnetic half-metal with a magnetic moment of 1.854 miuB per cell, while 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 is a flat-band related magnetic normal metal with a magnetic moment of 1.663 miuB per cell. These results not only show that flat-bands can be constructed in carbon monolayer, but also indicate the potential for achieving metal-free magnetic materials with light elements based on flat-band theory.</description>

      <title>Exchange-enhanced spin-orbit splitting and its density dependence for electrons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is substantially enhanced by electron-electron interaction. This effect, similar to the exchange-enhancement of the electron g-factor, is most pronounced for conduction band electrons (in particular, in MoS$_2$), and it has a non-monotonic dependence on the carrier sheet density, $n$. That is, the SOS enhancement is peaked at the onset of filling of the higher-energy spin-split band by electrons, $n_*$, which also separates the regimes of slow (at $n&lt;n_*$) and fast (for $n&gt;n_*$) spin and valley relaxation of charge carriers. Moreover, this density itself is determined by the enhanced SOS value, making the account of exchange renormalisation important for the analysis of spintronic performance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional TMDs.</description>
