      <title>A Simple View on Large-Signal Resonant-Tunneling-Diode Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for an accurate description of the large-signal resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD) dynamics, which allows for a simple and intuitive analysis in terms of dynamical trajectories in a phase space. We show that the RTD admittance can be accurately described by a simple RLRC equivalent circuit, which has a universal configuration, but with different circuit parameters in the large- and small-signal cases.</description>

      <title>Optical and Electrical Properties of Diamond-like-Carbon Coatings Prepared by Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Beam Deposition Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond-like carbon thin films have emerged as durable, chemically stable optical coatings for many optical and optoelectronics applications due to their hardness, chemical inertness, and optical transparency. This paper presents a novel high-energy electron cyclotron resonance ion beam sputter deposition technique to fabricate pure diamond-like carbon coatings at room temperature. The chemical composition of the deposited coatings including ratios of sp2/sp3 bonding in the thin films were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results indicate that the sp3 percentage ranges from 45% - 85%. The transmission and reflectance spectra of the coatings were measured from UV to IR ({\lambda}= 185 to 2500 nm) by utilizing a spectrophotometer. The measured spectra were analysed by the Tauc method to determine the optical band gap and Urbach energy and an optical fitting software, which utilizes the model modified by OJL, to extract the refractive index and extinction coefficient. By varying the ion energy, the optical properties were found to be n = 2.30 - 2.51, band gap energy = 0.4 - 0.68 eV, and the Urbach energy = 0.33 - 0.49 eV. This study provides a flexible method for tuning the structural, optical, and electronic properties of diamond-like carbon coatings by controlling the ion energy during deposition.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of phase change accommodating hydrogen uptake in bimetallic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuel, however storing it efficiently poses challenges. One promising solution is to adsorb hydrogen on solid materials demonstrating quasi-molecular bonding with hydrogen. The hydrogen adsorption energy can be tuned by changing the morphology or stoichiometry of bimetallic nanoparticles. Here we used complementary techniques to unveil the chemical compositional and morphological transformation undergone by PdxNi100-x nanoparticles during H2 adsorption. Our findings reveal NiO-rich shell and Pd-rich core as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, and electron energy loss spectroscopy. During hydrogen adsorption, which mainly occurs on Pd atoms, the Pd-rich core fragments into small pockets, increasing its surface area. This process is more pronounced for nanoparticles with lower Pd loading, emphasizing the role of NiO. These results shed light on the atomic changes occurring in the PdxNi100-x nanoparticles during hydrogen adsorption and can be applicable on multi-metallic systems to improve hydrogen storage properties.</description>

      <title>Optimal Demodulation Domain for Microwave SQUID Multiplexers in Presence of Readout System Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Microwave SQUID Multiplexer ({\mu}MUX) is the device of choice for the readout of a large number of Low-Temperature Detectors in a wide variety of experiments within the fields of astronomy and particle physics. While it offers large multiplexing factors, the system noise performance is highly dependent on the cold and warm-readout electronic systems used to read it out, as well as the demodulation domain and parameters chosen. In order to understand the impact of the readout systems in the overall noise performance, first we extended the available {\mu}MUX simulation frameworks including additive and multiplicative noise sources in the probing tones (i.e. phase and amplitude noise), along with the capability of demodulating the scientific data, either in resonator's phase or amplitude. Then, considering the additive noise as a dominant noise source, the optimum readout parameters to achieve minimum system noise were found for both open-loop and flux-ramp demodulation schemes in the aforementioned domains. Later, we evaluated the system noise sensitivity to multiplicative noise sources under the optimum readout parameters. Finally, as a case study, we evaluated the optimal demodulation domain and expected system noise level for a typical Software-Defined Radio (SDR) readout system. This work leads to an improved system performance prediction and noise engineering based on the available readout electronics and selected demodulation domain.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic toroidal dipole excitations in core-shell spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toroidal dipole moments, which consist of enclosed circulating currents aligned along paths within a torus shape, can be experimentally achieved in metamaterials using various geometrical configurations. Here, we investigate the excitation of toroidal dipole moments in a core-shell nanosphere composed of dispersive materials within the framework of the Lorenz-Mie theory. By isolating the contributions related to volumetric oscillations of electric charges from those of transverse and radial current oscillations, we derive closed-form analytic expressions for the scattering coefficients associated with electric and magnetic toroidal dipole moments. These analytic expressions, obtained beyond the Rayleigh scattering regime and previously concealed within the Lorenz-Mie theory, agree with the Cartesian toroidal dipoles determined from the radial and transverse current oscillations. By exploring the resonances in these calculated coefficients, we demonstrate that the electric and magnetic toroidal dipole excitations can be manipulated and tuned for near- and far-field applications involving plasmonic core-shell nanoparticles and engineered metamaterials. We believe that our analytic results could shed light on some of the extraordinary effects obtained in Lorenz-Mie theory that depend on the interference of multipole coefficients, such as toroidal dipole-induced transparency, Fano resonances and superscattering of light.</description>

      <title>High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources as it prepares the exciton state, defines the decay dynamics, and influences the spectral diffusion of the emitted single photons. Here, we investigate the impact of different optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission characteristics of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Under phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow and stable single-photon emission with an excellent purity reaching $ 0.94\pm 0.02\,$. Furthermore, the decay time is reduced by more than an order of magnitude from $(16.65 \pm 2.39)\,$ns for above-band excitation to $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns for phonon-assisted excitation. Finally, we observe a suppressed spectral wandering along with a two-fold reduction of the spectral linewidth. Our comprehensive investigation highlights the critical role of the excitation method in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Periodic phase-separation during meniscus-guided deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the meniscus-guided coating of a binary fluid mixture containing a solute and a volatile solvent that phase separates via spinodal decomposition. Motivation is the evaporation-driven deposition of material during the fabrication of organic thin film electronics. We find a transition in the phase-separation morphology from an array of droplet-shaped domains deposited periodically parallel to the slot opening to isotropically dispersed solute-rich droplets with increasing coating velocity. This transition originates from the competition between the hydrodynamic injection of the solution into the film and diffusive transport that cannot keep up with replenishing the depletion of solute near the solute-rich domains. The critical velocity separating the two regimes and the characteristic length scale of the phase-separated morphologies are determined by the ratio of two emergent length scales: (i) the spinodal length, which implicitly depends on the evaporation rate and the properties of the solution, and (ii) a depletion length proportional to the ratio of the tracer diffusivity of the solute and the coating velocity. For coating below the critical velocity, an array of droplet-shaped domains is deposited periodically parallel to the slot opening, with the domain size and deposition wavelength proportional to a solute depletion length. As the competition in the mass transport is inherent in any kind of unidirectional deposition of demixing solutions, our findings should apply to a broad range of coating techniques and forced demixing processes.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Transient infrared nanoscopy resolves the millisecond photoswitching dynamics of single lipid vesicles in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the biophysical and biochemical properties of molecular nanocarriers under physiological conditions and with minimal interference is crucial for advancing nanomedicine, photopharmacology, drug delivery, nanotheranostics and synthetic biology. Yet, analytical methods struggle to combine precise chemical imaging and measurements without perturbative labeling. This challenge is exemplified for azobenzene-based photoswitchable lipids, which are intriguing reagents for controlling nanocarrier properties on fast timescales, enabling, e.g., precise light-induced drug release processes. Here, we leverage the chemical recognition and high spatio-temporal resolution of scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to demonstrate non-destructive, label-free mid-infrared (MIR) imaging and spectroscopy of photoswitchable liposomes below the diffraction limit and the tracking of their dynamics down to 50 ms resolution. The vesicles are adsorbed on an ultrathin 10-nm SiN membrane, which separates the sample space from the tip space for stable and hour-long observations. By implementing a transient nanoscopy approach, we accurately resolve, for the first time, photoinduced changes in both the shape and the MIR spectral signature of individual vesicles and reveal abrupt change dynamics of the underlying photoisomerization process. Our findings highlight the methods potential for future studies on the complex dynamics of unlabeled nanoscale soft matter, as well as, in a broader context, for host-guest systems, energy materials or drugs.</description>
