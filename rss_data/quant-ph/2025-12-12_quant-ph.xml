      <title>Deep Thermalization and Measurements of Quantum Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.</description>

      <title>A Unified Linear Algebraic Framework for Physical Models and Generalized Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up, statistics-first framework in which the full probabilistic content of an operational theory is encoded in its matrix of conditional outcome probabilities of events (COPE). Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources.</description>

      <title>Broadband Spatio-Spectral Mode Conversion via Four-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for scalable and broadband free-space phase-matched four-wave mixing in ring resonators. This method for four-wave mixing reduces the complexity of coupling an emitter to a quantum network by combining the spatial and spectral interfaces between them into one nonlinear optical process. The device is compliant with current heterogeneous integration capabilities and has a bandwidth of 165 nm for efficient spatio-spectral conversion. We outline a fabrication-ready diamond-on-insulator pathway towards modular unit cells that natively bridge visible color centers to the infrared spectrum for scalable quantum networks. We also present and analyze an end-to-end framework for considering single-photon coupling efficiency from a color center to a quantum network. This framework represents a step forwards in analyzing and reducing system-scale losses in a spin-photon interface.</description>

      <title>Quantumness via Discrete Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical probabilistic theories in foundational ways. These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis.</description>

      <title>Gradient projection method and stochastic search for some optimal control models with spin chains. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article (I) considers the known optimal control model of a quantum information transfer along a spin chain with controlled external parabolic magnetic field, with an arbitrary length. The article adds certain lower and upper pointwise constraints on controls, adds the problem of keeping the signal at the last spin, considers various classes of controls. For these problems under piecewise continuous controls, the projection-type linearized Pontryagin maximum principle, gradient projection method's constructions in its one- and two- and three-step forms were adapted by analogy with [Morzhin O.V., Pechen A.N. J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 2025]. Moreover, an example with a genetic algorithm's successful use under a special class of controls is given.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks require interfaces translating memory photons to telecom wavelengths while controlling spatial modes; tasks performed by separate components today. We present a programmable alternative: a structured pump writes a virtual Bragg grating enabling simultaneous spatio-spectral conversion and real-time controlling of emission. Using a LiNbO$_3$ whispering-gallery resonator, we demonstrate 93\% spatial coupling and bidirectional conversion between 736\,nm and 1347\,nm. This reconfigurable interface eliminates cascaded losses and hardware modifications.</description>

      <title>Engineer coherent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework to engineer persistent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems governed by a time-independent Lindblad master equation. We show that oscillatory modes can be created when the Hamiltonian and jump operator can be expressed in the same block-diagonal form. A key feature of the framework is that the dissipator of the Lindblad master equation are generally non-zero. We identify the weak and strong conditions, where the onset of the oscillatory modes is dependent and independent of the parameters of the system, respectively. Our method extends beyond the typical decoherence-free subspace approach, in which the dissipator is zero. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using various models, showing how carefully tailored system-environment interactions can produce sustained coherent oscillations.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on Fluctuation Growths of Observables in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth of an observable in both open and closed quantum systems have been studied actively recently. In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth.</description>

      <title>Eight-Qubit Operation of a 300 mm SiMOS Foundry-Fabricated Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising candidate for quantum computing, thanks to their high coherence, high controllability and manufacturability. However, the most scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based implementations have so far been limited to a few qubits. Here, to take a step towards large scale systems, we tune and coherently control an eight-dot linear array of silicon spin qubits fabricated in 300 mm CMOS-compatible foundry process, establishing operational scalability beyond the two-qubit regime. All eight qubits are successfully tuned and characterized as four double dot pairs, exhibiting Ramsey dephasing times $T_2^*$ up to 41(2) $\mu$s and Hahn-echo coherence times $T_2^{\mathrm{Hahn}}$ up to 1.31(4) ms. Readout of the central four qubits is achieved via a cascaded charge-sensing protocol, enabling simultaneous high-fidelity measurements of the entire multi-qubit array. Additionally, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate operation between adjacent qubits with low phase noise. We demonstrate here that we can scale silicon spin qubit arrays to medium-sized arrays of 8 qubits while maintaining coherence of the system.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Classical and Quantum Communications: Recent Progress and Three Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical aspect of next-generation wireless networks is the integration of quantum communications to guard against quantum computing threats to classical networks. Despite successful experimental demonstrations, integrating quantum communications into the classical infrastructure faces substantial challenges, including high costs, compatibility issues, and extra hardware deployment to accommodate both classical and quantum communication equipment. To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications. Finally, we identify open problems that must be addressed to facilitate practical implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article envisions the concept of a ``Quantum Internet in the Sky", aiming to establish ubiquitous quantum communication links among distant nodes via free-space optical channels. Our key focus is on deploying quantum communication terminals on non-terrestrial platforms, specifically unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites, at various altitudes. By highlighting the unique characteristics of these platforms compared to terrestrial counterparts, we address inherent challenges and discuss potential solutions through meticulous system designs and analyses of typical non-terrestrial quantum communication scenarios. Finally, we illuminate the path forward by proposing essential future directions that underscore the integration of high-dimensional multipartite quantum communications with sensing, computing, and intelligence for multiple users en route to realizing a fully operational Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>Optical fuse based on the photorefractive effect for defending the light-injection attacks of quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-injection attacks pose critical security threats to quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Conventional defense methods, such as isolators, filters, and optical power monitoring, are confronted with the threats of specific attacks and the limitations in integration. To address this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an integrated attack sensing and automatic response unit utilizing the photorefractive effect in a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Our unit provides a high rejection ratio against non-resonant injected light. For resonant attacks exceeding tens of microwatts, the unit can autonomously attenuate the transmission of the quantum signal light, leading to a significant suppression of the secret key rate. This work enhances the security of QKD systems against light-injection attacks by providing a highly sensitive, broadband, and on-chip defense mechanism.</description>

      <title>Entropic Uncertainty Relations with Quantum Memory in Accelerated Frames via Unruh-DeWitt Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum uncertainty is deeply linked to quantum correlations and relativistic motion. The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum memory offers a powerful way to study how shared entanglement affects measurement precision. However, under acceleration, the Unruh effect can degrade quantum correlations, raising questions about the reliability of QMA-EUR in such settings. Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Optimal learning of quantum channels in diamond distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory and a key primitive for characterising noisy quantum devices. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\mathrm{in}} d_{\mathrm{out}} k/\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance.</description>

      <title>Generating strong mechanical squeezing via combined squeezed vacuum field and two-tone driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for generating mechanical squeezed states based on the combined mechanism of a two-tone driving and a squeezed vacuum field. This innovative approach achieves a remarkable improvement in mechanical squeezing performance across the entire range of red/blue detuning ratios. Our study reveals that the squeezed vacuum field not only induces position squeezing of the mechanical oscillator but also facilitates momentum squeezing through phase matching. Moreover, the total squeezing degree exhibits nonlinear enhancement with the increasing of squeezing parameter $r$. The mechanical squeezed state exhibits a $2\pi$-periodic dependence in relation to the squeezing phase $\theta$, offering experimental implementation with a high degree of operational flexibility. Notably, the scheme exhibits strong robustness against cavity dissipation and environmental thermal noise, substantially relaxing the strict parameter-matching requirements inherent in conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Integrated Generation and Purification of Entangled Coherent States for Non-Gaussian Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled coherent states (ECS) provide a powerful non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum communication, but their generation in scalable architectures remains challenging. We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so. Our results show that integrated photon subtraction and catalysis enable practical, chip-compatible generation of non-Gaussian entanglement suitable for advanced quantum teleportation and continuous-variable quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple protocol for measuring properties of a gapped ground state with essentially no disturbance to the state. The required Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the spectral gap and target precision (up to logarithmic factors), which is optimal. For local observables on geometrically local systems, the protocol only requires Hamiltonian evolution on a quasi-local patch of inverse-gap radius. Our results show that gapped ground states are algorithmically readable from a single copy without a recovery or rewinding procedure, which may drastically reduce tomography overhead in certain quantum simulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum relaxometry for detecting biomolecular interactions with single NV centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems, offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we re-examined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule Scale Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using a Robust Near-Infrared Spin Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at the single-molecule level with atomic resolution holds transformative potential for structural biology and surface chemistry. Near-surface solid-state spin sensors with optical readout ability offer a promising pathway toward this goal. However, their extreme proximity to target molecules demands exceptional robustness against surface-induced perturbations. Furthermore, life science applications require these sensors to operate in biocompatible spectral ranges that minimize photodamage. In this work, we demonstrate that the PL6 quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) can serve as a robust near-infrared spin sensor. This sensor operates at tissue-transparent wavelengths and exhibits exceptional near-surface stability even at depth of 2 nm. Using shallow PL6 centers, we achieve nanoscale NMR detection of proton ($\mathrm{^{1}H}$) spins in immersion oil and fluorine ($\mathrm{^{19}F}$) spins in Fomblin, attaining a detection volume of $\mathrm{(3~nm)^3}$ and a sensitivity reaching the requirement for single-proton spin detection. This work establishes 4H-SiC quantum sensors as a compelling platform for nanoscale magnetic resonance, with promising applications in probing low-dimensional water phases, protein folding dynamics, and molecular interactions.</description>

For the case $N=3$, the given in this article examples together with Example 3 in Article I show that: a) the adapted GPM and genetic algorithm (GA) successfully solved numerically the considered transfer and keeping problems; b) the two- and three-step GPM forms significantly surpass the one-step GPM. Moreover, GA and a special class of controls were successfully used in such the transfer problem that $N=20$ and the final time is not assigned.</description>

      <title>Tunable discrete quasi-time crystal from a single drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for exotic temporal orders in quantum matter, such as discrete quasi-time crystals (DQTCs), has become an important theme in nonequilibrium physics. However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a powerful framework for state preparation, while its evolution time often scales quadratically in the inverse Hamiltonian spectral gap, leading to sub-optimal computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear adaptive strategy for finding the time scheduling function, and show that the gap dependence can be quadratically improved to be inverse linear for a wide range of systems under a mild gap measure condition. Through variational analysis, we further demonstrate the optimality of our schedule for systems with linear gap and the partial optimality for general systems, while we also rigorously show that the commonly used linear schedule is never optimal.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic generation of entangled travelling fields with different polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Generation of mechanical cat-like states via optomagnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems require optimal performance of both quantum and classical channels - utilizing as few as possible qubits and bits for establishing as many as possible key bits. Here we report a way to determine if a quantum key distribution model (or protocol) operates in an optimal behavior. This is accomplished by introducing a quantity, called optimality, which is the maximum over the total efficiency of a QKD under any circumstances (any values of QKD parameters). The optimality definition is given for the asymptotic operation of a QKD system - when infinitely many quantum systems are transferred/used in a quantum key distribution protocol or a quantum key distribution system is used infinitely many times. A way to attain the optimality is considered\textemdash implementation of a completely efficient QKD system (a combination of capacity-reaching quantum channel and a completely compressed classical channel) is presented. Optimal versions of BB84-QKD and twin-field QKD are introduced.</description>

Abstract: We present a feasible and scalable approach to testing Bell nonlocality and implementing device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) between distant atomic states in cavity-based architectures, mediated by hybrid atom-light entanglement. We develop a full theoretical model that incorporates realistic sources of noise -- such as transmission loss, limited light-matter coupling efficiency, and imperfect detection. Our analysis shows that strong Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violations and secure key generation over tens of kilometers are within reach using current or near-term technology. These results position cavity-based platforms with coherent-state encodings as a promising foundation for future scalable, DI quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Ising on the donut: Regimes of topological quantum error correction from statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utility-scale quantum computers require quantum error correcting codes with large numbers of physical qubits to achieve sufficiently low logical error rates. The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ans\"atze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits.</description>

      <title>Robust population transfer by a detuning sign jump: from two-state quantum system to SU(2)-symmetric three-state quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a robust population-transfer protocol in a driven two-level system based on a sudden sign change of the detuning at the maximum of a smooth coupling pulse. Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.
  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states. In particular, we show that for strong coupling the protocol yields almost complete population transfer between the two outer states, with only small transient population of the middle state, while retaining the same intrinsic robustness as in the underlying two-level model.</description>

      <title>Shot and Architecture Adaptive Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Microwave Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for electromagnetic eigenmode analysis, enabling compact representations of complex field interactions and potential exponential speedup over classical numerical solvers. Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distributed Similarity Estimation for Unitary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributed similarity estimation for unitary channels (DSEU), the task of estimating the similarity between unitary channels implemented on different quantum devices. We completely address DSEU by showing that, for $n$-qubit unitary channels, the query complexity of DSEU is $\Theta(\sqrt{d})$, where $d=2^n$, for both incoherent and coherent accesses. First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\sqrt{d})$. Although incoherent access is generally weaker than coherent access, our incoherent algorithm matches this complexity by leveraging additional shared randomness between devices, highlighting the power of shared randomness in distributed quantum learning. We further establish matching lower bounds, proving that $\Theta(\sqrt{d})$ queries are both necessary and sufficient for DSEU. Finally, we compare our algorithms with independent classical shadow and show that ours have a square-root advantage. Our results provide practical and theoretically optimal tools for quantum devices benchmarking and for distributed quantum learning.</description>

      <title>On Simplest Kochen-Specker Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 190203 (2025) a discovery of the simplest 3D contextual set with 33 vertices, 50 bases, and 14 complete bases is claimed. In this paper, we show that it was previously generated in Quantum 7, 953 (2023) and analyze the meaning, origin, and significance of the simplest contextual sets in any dimension. In particular, we prove that there is no ground to consider the aforementioned set as fundamental since there are many 3D contextual sets with a smaller number of complete bases. We also show that automatic generation of contextual sets from basic vector components automatically yields all known minimal contextual sets of any kind in any dimension and therefore also the aforementioned set in no CPU-time. In the end, we discuss varieties of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS), extended KS, and non-KS sets as well as ambiguities in their definitions.</description>

      <title>Chaos, Entanglement and Measurement: Field-Theoretic Perspectives on Quantum Information Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops tools to understand how quantum information spreads, scrambles, and is reshaped by measurements in many-body systems. First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow.</description>

      <title>The relativistic reason for quantum probability amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the quantum-mechanical probability distribution involving complex probability amplitudes can be derived from three natural conditions imposed on a relativistically invariant probability function describing the motion of a particle that can take multiple paths simultaneously. The conditions are: (i) pairwise Kolmogorov additivity, (ii) time symmetry, and (iii) Bayes' rule. The resulting solution, parameterized by a single constant, is the squared modulus of a sum of complex exponentials of the relativistic action, thereby recovering the Feynman path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Tianyan: Cloud services with quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tianyan Quantum Cloud Platform offers cloud services demonstrating quantum advantage capabilities with a Zuchongzhi 3.0-like superconducting quantum processor. This cloud-accessible superconducting quantum prototype, named Tianyan-287, features 105 qubits and achieves high operational fidelities, with single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates, and readout fidelity at 99.90%, 99.56%, 98.7%, respectively. For a specific benchmark task involving random circuit sampling on a 74-qubit system over 24 cycles, the platform completes one million samples in just 18.4 minutes. In contrast, state-of-the-art classical supercomputers would require approximately 16,000 years to complete the equivalent calculation. To facilitate this, the platform provides access via Cqlib, an open-source SDK designed for working with quantum systems at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives. The cloud service aims to democratize access to high-performance quantum hardware, enabling the community to validate and explore practical quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Encoding parameters by measurement: Forgetting can be better in quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quantum parameter estimation with the encoding being via a quantum measurement. We quantify the precision for estimating parameters characterizing a general two-outcome qubit measurement, considering two cases: when the outcomes of the encoding measurement are recorded and when the same are ignored. We find that in a large variety of such estimation scenarios, forgetting the outcomes yields higher precision. We derive a necessary criterion under which remembering the measurement outcomes provides better precision in comparison to the outcome-forgotten strategy. Furthermore, we establish a necessary and sufficient criterion for the simultaneous estimation of two parameters encoded by an arbitrary quantum process, including those involving measurements, using qubit probes, and find when the quantum Cram\'er$-$Rao bound is valid and achievable. For simultaneous estimation of two parameters characterizing the measurement, we find that the achievable quantum Cram\'er$-$Rao bound can be a valid precision bound only when the measurement direction depends on the parameters of interest.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Annealing Approach for High-Dimensional and Multi-Criteria Constrained Quadratic Optimization in Arctic Ship Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opening of Arctic sea routes presents unprecedented opportunities for global trade but poses significant operational and computational challenges due to the dynamic nature of sea ice conditions. This study formulates a multi criteria Arctic route optimization problem that integrates Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) variables into a Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) and solves it using D Wave's hybrid quantum classical solver. We benchmark the feasibility and scalability of this approach against classical Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers such as Gurobi and CPLEX. Results show that the CQM formulation achieves feasible solutions with stable runtimes as quadratic density increases, demonstrating 10 to 100 times faster convergence and reduced computational time compared with classical solvers, while also improving route smoothness by approximately 10 percent and reducing total length by approximately 1 percent. This reflects the effectiveness of the hybrid quantum annealing approach for Arctic routing problems.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity threshold defines the optimal spin subset for ensemble quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite drive power leaves unavoidable spatial gradients in control fields, preventing spin ensembles from reaching the standard-quantum-limit sensitivity. We derive an analytic expression of ensemble sensitivity for inhomogeneous spin sensors and introduce sensitivity thresholds that reveal the optimal spin subset. Applied to both pulsed and continuous-wave magnetometry, the optimal subsets deliver up to a tenfold improvement over conventional schemes relying on nominally uniform regions of the ensembles. We demonstrate phase-only digital holography to implement the optimal subsets and show that residual aberrations add less than 1 dB of sensitivity loss. Our framework imposes no fundamental trade-offs and extends quantum sensing to heterogeneous sensing environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Amplified M/G/1/K Simulation: A Comparator-Controlled Framework for Arbitrary Service Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-capacity single-server queues with general service-time distributions form the backbone of numerous real-world systems, yet classical simulation of performance metrics such as blocking probabilities and delay becomes computationally prohibitive as service variability or required precision increases. This work presents the first coherent quantum circuit for simulating an M/G/1/K queue under arbitrary service-time laws. The circuit encodes the service distribution through a logarithmic-depth ladder of $R_y$ rotations and enforces buffer constraints via a comparator-controlled phase gate, while preserving the quadratic speed-up of amplitude amplification. Grover iterations center on estimating the expected number of customers in the system, yielding provable $O(\sqrt{N})$ variance reduction and closed-form confidence bounds, where $N$ denotes the number of shots. Empirical evaluations on IBM quantum simulators across four service distributions and three traffic intensities demonstrate fidelity above 0.99 with four qubits and above 0.76 with ten qubits, with Jensen-Shannon divergence below 0.11. Waiting-time estimation errors decrease by an order of magnitude as system load approaches capacity and remain within 3% in high-traffic regimes using registers of up to 63 qubits. These results establish the first end-to-end quantum simulation framework for finite-buffer, non-Markovian queueing systems and provide a concrete foundation for quantum-accelerated performance analysis in service-oriented architectures.</description>

      <title>Insensitivity points and performance of open quantum interferometers under number- conserving &amp; non-conserving Lindblad dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a linear two-mode atom interferometer subject to environmental noise, modeled within the framework of open quantum systems with both number- conserving and non-conserving Lindblad operators. Considering several input states, we first study the cases N=1,2 (N number of particles) and perform numerical simulations for N&gt;2. The sensitivity as a function of the holding time can display divergence points where phase estimation becomes impossible, to which we refer as insensitivity points. We characterize their behavior as the input state, particle number, and noise operator are varied, and we find that their positions are independent of the noise intensity. Moreover, while our fixed measurement scheme may favor number-conserving noise at small N (i.e., having better sensitivity), the Cram\'er-Rao bound reveals that particle non-conserving noise yields strictly lower achievable sensitivity for all particle numbers.</description>

      <title>Topology-Guided Quantum GANs for Constrained Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) promises theoretical advantages, benefiting computational problems that would not be efficiently classically simulatable. However, much of this theoretical speedup depends on the quantum circuit design solving the problem. We argue that QC literature has yet to explore more domain specific ansatz-topologies, instead of relying on generic, one-size-fits-all architectures. In this work, we show that incorporating task-specific inductive biases -- specifically geometric priors -- into quantum circuit design can enhance the performance of hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuGANs) on the task of generating geometrically constrained K4 graphs. We evaluate a portfolio of entanglement topologies and loss-function designs to assess their impact on both statistical fidelity and compliance with geometric constraints, including the Triangle and Ptolemaic inequalities. Our results show that aligning circuit topology with the underlying problem structure yields substantial benefits: the Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves the highest geometric validity among quantum models and matches the performance of classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Additionally, we showcase how specific architectural choices, such as entangling gate types, variance regularization and output-scaling govern the trade-off between geometric consistency and distributional accuracy, thus emphasizing the value of structured, task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of low-entanglement bosonic Gaussian states in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian states appear ubiquitously in quantum optics and condensed matter physics but remain difficult to simulate classically due to the hafnian bottleneck. We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>All-photonic entanglement swapping with remote quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a protocol that details how to create entanglement between previously uncorrelated particles. Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances. Our work opens the path to the exploitation of quantum dot entangled-photon sources in quantum repeater networks.</description>

      <title>Pulsed learning for quantum data re-uploading models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds great potential, its practical realization on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware has been hindered by the limitations of variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Recent evidence suggests that VQCs suffer from severe trainability and noise-related issues, leading to growing skepticism about their long-term viability. However, the possibility of implementing learning models directly at the pulse-control level remains comparatively unexplored and could offer a promising alternative. In this work, we formulate a pulse-based variant of data re-uploading, embedding trainable parameters directly into the native system's dynamics. We benchmark our approach on a simulated superconducting transmon processor with realistic noise profiles. The pulse-based model consistently outperforms its gate-based counterpart, exhibiting higher test accuracy and improved generalization under equivalent noise conditions. Moreover, by systematically increasing noise strength, we show that pulse-level implementations retain higher fidelity for longer, demonstrating enhanced resilience to decoherence and control errors. These results suggest that pulse-native architectures, though less explored, may offer a viable and hardware-aligned path forward for practical QML in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>A Cryogenic Muon Tagging System Based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors for Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation has emerged as a potential limiting factor for superconducting quantum processors, inducing quasiparticle bursts and correlated errors that challenge fault-tolerant operation. Atmospheric muons are particularly problematic due to their high energy and penetration power, making passive shielding ineffective. Therefore, monitoring the real-time muon flux is crucial to guide the development of alternative error-correction or protection strategies. We present the design, simulation, and first operation of a cryogenic muon-tagging system based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) for integration with superconducting quantum processors. The system consists of two KIDs arranged in a vertical stack and operated at ~20 mK. Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4 guided the prototype design and provided reference expectations for muon-tagging efficiency and accidental coincidences due to ambient $\gamma$-rays. We measured a muon-induced coincidence rate among the top and bottom detectors of (192 $\pm$ 9) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ events/s, in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo prediction. The prototype achieves a muon-tagging efficiency of about 90% with negligible dead time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating a muon-tagging system at millikelvin temperatures and open the path toward its integration with multi-qubit chips to veto or correct muon-induced errors in real time.</description>

      <title>Advantage in distributed quantum computing with slow interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main bottleneck for distributed quantum computing is the rate at which entanglement is produced between quantum processing units (QPUs). In this work, we prove that multiple QPUs connected through slow interconnects can outperform a monolithic architecture made with a single QPU. We consider a distributed quantum computing model with the following assumptions: (1) each QPU is linked to only two other QPUs, (2) each link produces only one Bell pair at a time, (3) the time to generate a Bell pair is $\tau_e$ times longer than the gate time. We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $\tau_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits. In the asymptotic regime, we relax assumption (2) and we prove that links producing $O(t/\ln t)$ Bell pairs in parallel, where $t$ is the number of QPUs, is sufficient to avoid stalling distributed CliNR, independently of the number of qubits per QPU. This demonstrates the potential of distributed CliNR for near-term multi-QPU devices. Moreover, we envision a distributed quantum superiority experiment based on the conjugated Clifford circuits of Bouland, Fitzsimons and Koh implemented with distributed CliNR.</description>

      <title>Sub-Bath Cooling in Bosonic Systems: Gaussian Constraints and Non-Gaussian Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling quantum systems with finite resources is a central task in quantum technologies and has been extensively explored in discrete-variable settings. As continuous-variable (CV) platforms play an increasingly important role in quantum information processing, it becomes crucial to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling bosonic systems. In this work, we develop a general framework for cooling CV systems, identifying both the constraints imposed by Gaussianity and the advantages enabled by non-Gaussian interactions. We derive a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations that applies to arbitrary cooling architectures. By optimizing over all protocols saturating this bound, we further identify the most efficient scheme, which minimizes dissipated energy for a given number of ancilla modes. Beyond Gaussian operations, we show that $p$-excitation exchange exploits non-Gaussian resources to achieve a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit. Our results establish the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling and reveal the crucial role of non-Gaussianity in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers.</description>

      <title>Scalable Optical Links for Controlling Bosonic Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computational capabilities. However, scaling up large quantum processors is limited by the cumbersome and heat-conductive electronic cables that connect room-temperature control electronics to quantum processors, leading to significant signal attenuation. Optical fibers provide a promising solution, but their use has been restricted to controlling simple two-level quantum systems over short distances. Here, we demonstrate optical control of a bosonic quantum processor, achieving universal operations on the joint Hilbert space of a transmon qubit and a storage cavity. Using an array of cryogenic fiber-integrated uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes, we prepare Fock states containing up to ten photons. Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%. The combination of high-dimensional quantum control, multi-channel operation, and long-distance transmission addresses the key requirements for scaling superconducting quantum computers and enables architectures for distributed quantum data centers.</description>

      <title>Understanding Surface-Induced Decoherence of NV Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Complexity and multi-functional variants of the Quantum-to-Quantum Bernoulli Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bernoulli factory is a model for randomness manipulation that transforms an initial Bernoulli random variable into another Bernoulli variable by applying a predetermined function relating the output bias to the input one. In literature, quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory schemes have been proposed, which encode both the input and output variables using qubit amplitudes. This fundamental concept can serve as a subroutine for quantum algorithms that involve Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods, or that require data encryption, like in blind quantum computation. In this work, we present a characterisation of the complexity of the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory by providing a lower bound on the required number of qubits needed to implement the protocol, an upper bound on the success probability and the quantum circuit that saturates the bounds. We also formalise and analyse two different variants of the original problem that address the possibility of increasing the number of input biases or the number of functions implemented by the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. The obtained results can be used as a framework for randomness manipulation via such an approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approaches to Urban Logistics: From Core QAOA to Clustered Scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, widely applied in logistics and transportation. As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios. This study advances quantum optimization and lays groundwork for future large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Estimating Detector Error Models on Google's Willow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consolidate recent theoretical advances in Detector Error Model (DEM) estimation and formalize several algorithms to learn DEM parameters and structure from syndromes without using a decoder, demonstrating recovery of known DEMs from simulated syndromes with precision limited only by finite-sample effects. We then apply these algorithms to estimate DEMs from Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips. Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Optimized Measurement Schedules for the Surface Code with Dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that fabrication defects can be well-handled using a strategy relying on the mid-error-correction-cycle state. In this work we present two improvements to the original prescription. First, we quantify the impact of the choice of a more complete set of gauge operators originally proposed for the hex-grid surface code on the standard square-grid surface code, as well as a new method for excising effectively unused qubits. Second, we leverage the expressivity of the LUCI framework as an intermediate representation, using integer linear programming to find performant physical circuits from the large space of valid LUCI circuits. We show that on the $d = 11$ surface code at $1\%(3\%)$ dropout rate for qubits and couplers, these optimizations allow for a total improvement of $14.5\%(23.6\%)$ over $4d$ round of syndrome extraction using the SI1000 noise model at $0.1\%$ noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) is a powerful method for preparing ground states on quantum hardware. However, executing QITE has costly measurement budgets for general Hamiltonians. Both fidelity and computational cost are strongly dependent on the definition of suitable local domains and Hamiltonian partitions. In this work, we introduce the Multiple-Time QITE algorithm (MT-QITE). We show how using more than one imaginary time substantially improves the fidelity of the resulting ground state as well as the measurement overhead with respect to the previously published QITE algorithm, while preserving its deterministic character and its independence from ad hoc ansatze. Moreover, unlike QITE and other QITE-based algorithms, MT-QITE is parallelizable, and we show that even in Hamiltonians with non-local interactions, partitioning may entail a computational advantage.</description>

      <title>ENTCALC: Toolkit for calculating geometric entanglement in multipartite quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present entcalc, a Python and MATLAB package for estimating the geometric entanglement of multipartite quantum states. The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states.</description>

      <title>Quantifying classical and quantum bounds for resolving closely spaced, non-interacting, simultaneously emitting dipole sources in optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that the quantum Fisher information associated with estimating the separation between two optical point sources remains finite at small separations, effectively opening new routes to super-resolution imaging of simultaneously emitting sources. Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Expansions for Approximate Tensor Network Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.</description>

      <title>Qubit decoherence in dissipative two-photon resonator: real-time instantons and Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a single bosonic cavity subject to two-photon driving and two-photon dissipation in the presence of finite detuning. Exploiting a hidden time-reversal symmetry, the Wigner representation and the WKB method, we introduce an effective phase-space potential for description of the steady state. It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluctuations. By employing the Keldysh real-time path integral formalism, we compute the instanton trajectory governing the quantum activation process between these attractors and establish a fundamental connection with the Wigner representation. This relation unifies the steady-state phase-space description with dynamical quantum activation processes. We also derive an analytical expression for the decoherence rate of the system. Our work provides a coherent theoretical framework for analyzing quantum bistability, metastability, and decoherence in driven-dissipative nonlinear resonators, with direct implications for the design of bosonic qubits and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.</description>

      <title>QSTAformer: A Quantum-Enhanced Transformer for Robust Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation. While classical machine learning-based methods have demonstrated strong performance, they still face challenges in robustness under adversarial conditions. This paper proposes QSTAformer-a tailored quantum-enhanced Transformer architecture that embeds parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into attention mechanisms-for robust and efficient STVSA. A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that QSTAformer achieves competitive accuracy, reduced complexity, and stronger robustness, underscoring its potential for secure and scalable STVSA under adversarial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is given for the case of a complex phase space weight, which applies generally in quantum statistical mechanics. Computer simulations using Lennard-Jones $^4$He near the $\lambda$-transition, including an expansion to third order of the Wigner-Kirkwood commutation function, give a saturation liquid density in agreement with measured values.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Hall Viscosity of the Laughlin State on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hall viscosity is a quantized nondissipative stress response of a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid to adiabatic geometric deformations. Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime.</description>

      <title>Universal relaxation speedup in open quantum systems through transient conditional and unconditional resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speeding up the relaxation dynamics of many-body quantum systems is important in a variety of contexts, including quantum computation and state preparation. We demonstrate that such acceleration can be universally achieved via transient stochastic resetting. This means that during an initial time interval of finite duration, the dynamics is interrupted by resets that take the system to a designated state at randomly selected times. We illustrate this idea for few-body open systems and also for a challenging many-body case, where a first-order phase transition leads to a divergence of relaxation time. In all scenarios, a significant and sometimes even exponential acceleration in reaching the stationary state is observed, similar to the so-called Mpemba effect. The universal nature of this speedup lies in the fact that the design of the resetting protocol only requires knowledge of a few macroscopic properties of the target state, such as the order parameter of the phase transition, while it does not necessitate any fine-tuned manipulation of the initial state.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze entanglement generated by the Schwinger effect using a mode-by-mode formalism for scalar and spinor QED in constant backgrounds. Starting from thermal initial states, we derive compact, closed-form results for bipartite entanglement between particle-antiparticle partners in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. For bosons, thermal fluctuations enhance production but suppress quantum correlations: the logarithmic negativity is nonzero only below a (mode-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$. At fixed $T$, entanglement appears only above a critical field $E_{\text{crit,entang}}$. For fermions, we observe a qualitatively different pattern: at finite $T$ entanglement exists only within a finite window $E_{\text{min}} &lt; E &lt; E_{\text{max}}$, with a temperature-independent optimal field strength $E_{*}$ that maximizes the logarithmic negativity. Entanglement is vanishing above $T_{\text{max}}=\omega/\text{arcsinh}(1)$. We give quantitative estimates for analog experiments, where our entanglement criteria convert directly into concrete temperature and electric field constraints. These findings identify realistic regimes where the quantum character of Schwinger physics may be tested in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Inflation is Not Magic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations generated during inflation exhibit striking quantum features, including entanglement and high circuit complexity. Yet their observational signatures remain effectively indistinguishable from classical stochastic variables. We quantify this tension by showing that quantum inflationary perturbations are continuous variable stabilizer states with vanishing quantum magic, a necessary resource for universal quantum computation as measured by Wigner negativity. Consequently, despite their quantum origins and description, these states can be efficiently simulated using classical algorithms. We further show that the Wigner negativity arising from primordial non-Gaussianity is suppressed not only by the non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, but also by the exponential squeezing of the perturbations. Viewing the early universe as a "high complexity, low magic" regime provides another perspective of what it means for the origin of structure in the universe to be "quantum."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish efficient approximate counting algorithms for several natural problems in local lemma regimes. In particular, we consider the probability of intersection of events and the dimension of intersection of subspaces. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method. We obtain fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for both the probability of intersection and the dimension of intersection for commuting projectors. For general projectors, we provide two algorithms: a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme under a global inclusion-exclusion stability condition, and an efficient affine approximation under a spectral gap assumption. As corollaries of our results, we obtain efficient algorithms for approximating the number of satisfying assignments of conjunctive normal form formulae and the dimension of satisfying subspaces of quantum satisfiability formulae.</description>

      <title>Search for a solar-bound axion halo using the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for a gravitationally bound solar axion halo using data from the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), a worldwide array of magnetically shielded atomic magnetometers with sensitivity to exotic spin couplings. Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space.</description>

      <title>Excitation energies and UV-Vis absorption spectra from INDO/s+ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in C$^*$-algebras: tensor products of state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Namioka-Phelps minimal and maximal tensor products of compact convex sets arising as state spaces of C$^*$-algebras, and, relatedly, study entanglement in (infinite dimensional) C$^*$-algebras. The minimal Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the state spaces of two C$^*$-algebras is shown to correspond to the set of separable (= un-entangled) states on the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras.
  The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. This can be used, for example, to show that the trace simplex of (any) tensor product of two C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex if and only if the trace simplex of each of the C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise an efficient optically-heated neutral atom source for ion trapping. We observe loading rates of up to $24(3)\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ with heating powers below $85\,\mathrm{mW}$, and demonstrate loading of a single ion in under $30\,\mathrm{s}$ with $41.4(4)\,\mathrm{mW}$ of optical power in a room-temperature ion trap system with an ionisation probability of $1.50(5)\times10^{-5}$. We calibrate a thermal model for the source's internal temperature by imaging the fluorescence of a collimated flux of neutral calcium that effuses from the oven at various optical heating powers. We show that the thermal performance of this oven is mainly limited by radiative losses. We explore the effect of second-stage photo-ionisation laser power on the loading rate, and identify a path beyond the loading rates reported in this study. We predict that this source is also well-suited to a wide range of metals used in ion-trapping.</description>

      <title>Edge states of a Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheet in a perpendicular magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with second nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.</description>

Abstract: By considering an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, we study how to induce metrics on a distinguished subset of the completely positive maps between tracial $C^*$-algebras using seminorms from noncommutative geometry. Under suitable conditions on the these seminorms, we show that the induced metrics will satisfy the quantum information theoretic properties of stability and chaining. Lastly, we show how to generate such metrics from Kasparov exterior products of spectral triples.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical matrix-product state and Lanczos methods for electron-phonon systems with strong electronic correlations: Application to disordered systems coupled to Einstein phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.</description>

      <title>Rapid multi-mode trapped-ion laser cooling in a phase-stable standing wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to precise control and interrogation of atomic quantum systems. In the context of quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, the integrated optical control of interest for scaling may additionally enable increased performance of coherent and incoherent operations. Here we utilize multi-channel integrated delivery of ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths required for calcium ion control including in passively phase-stable ultraviolet standing waves to demonstrate rapid, broadband laser cooling. We experimentally verify a long-standing prediction, realizing Doppler cooling to below the conventional Doppler limit at a standing-wave (SW) node. Utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), we experimentally cool motional modes spanning an approximately 5 MHz bandwidth from the Doppler temperature to near the ground state within 150 $\mu$s, reaching $\bar n \approx 0.05$ phonon number occupancies for the target mode. Direct evaluation against the comparable running-wave (RW) scheme shows the SW implementation's simultaneous advantage in cooling rate, motional mode bandwidth, and final phonon number as previously theoretically predicted. Our results demonstrate structured light's capability for robust ground-state laser cooling, and a clear advantage in a fundamental functionality enabled by scalable approaches to optical control.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum version of the classical twin paradox in special relativity by replacing the twins with quantum detectors, and studying the transitions and entanglement induced by coupling them to a quantum field. We show that the \textit{changes} in direction of acceleration leave imprints on detector responses and entanglement, inducing novel features which might have relevance in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a cornerstone of quantum condensed matter physics, providing the foundation for developing density functional theory and understanding electronic phases in semiconductors. However, theoretical understanding of strongly-correlated electrons in realistic semiconductor systems remains limited. In this work, we develop a neural network based variational approach to study quantum wells in three dimensional geometry for a variety of electron densities and well thicknesses. Starting from first principles, our unbiased AI-powered method reveals metallic and crystalline phases with both monolayer and bilayer charge distributions. In the emergent bilayer, we discover a new quantum phase of matter: the electronic quasicrystal.</description>

      <title>On Decision-Making Agents and Higher-Order Causal Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Quantum CSS Error-Correcting Codes via MacWilliams Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum stabilizer codes, one of the most important classes for practical implementations, on both symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels. To this aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with \acl{MW} decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of the bounds over the depolarizing channel. We introduce a novel approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis, allowing the derivation of the exact asymptotic error rate for short codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $\rho \to 0$, the logical error rate $\rho_\mathrm{L}$ is asymptotically $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16 \rho^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16.3 \rho^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 18.7 \rho^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 149.3 \rho^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For larger codes our bound provides $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 1215 \rho^4$ and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 663 \rho^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the $[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively. Finally, we extend our analysis to include realistic, noisy syndrome extraction circuits by modeling error propagation throughout gadgets. This enables estimation of logical error rates under faulty measurements. The performance analysis serves as a design tool for developing fault-tolerant quantum systems by guiding the selection of quantum codes based on their error correction capability. Additionally, it offers a novel perspective on quantum degeneracy, showing it represents the fraction of non-correctable error patterns shared by multiple logical operators.</description>

      <title>General teleportation channel in Fermionic Quantum Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Teleportation is a very useful scheme for transferring quantum information. Given that the quantum information is encoded in a state of a system of distinguishable particles, and given that the shared bi-partite entangled state is also that of a system of distinguishable particles, the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of the shared state is known to be $(F_{max}d+1)/(d+1)$ with $F_{max}$ being the `maximal singlet fraction' of the shared state. However, Parity Superselection Rule (PSSR) in Fermionic Quantum Theory (FQT) puts constraint on the allowed set of physical states and operations, and thereby, leads to a different notion of Quantum entanglement - locally accessible and locally inaccessible. In the present work, we derive an expression for the $\textit{optimal teleportation fidelity}$ of locally accessible entanglement preservation, given that the quantum information to be teleported is encoded in fermionic modes of dimension $2^N \times 2^N$ using $2^N \times 2^N$-dim shared fermionic resource between the sender and receiver. To get the optimal teleportation fidelity in FQT, we introduce PSSR restricted twirling operations and establish fermionic state-channel isomorphism. Remarkably, we notice that the structure of the canonical form of twirl invariant fermionic shared state differs from that of the $\textit{isotropic state}$ -- the corresponding canonical invariant form for teleportation in Standard Quantum Theory (SQT). In this context, we also introduce restricted Clifford twirling operation that constitute the Unitary 2-design in case of FQT for experimentally validating such optimal average fidelity. Finally, we discuss the preservation of locally inaccessible entanglement for a class of fermionic teleportation channel.</description>

      <title>A fixed-point algorithm for matrix projections with applications in quantum information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a fixed-point iterative algorithm that computes the matrix projection with respect to the Bures distance on the set of positive definite matrices that are invariant under some symmetry. We prove that the fixed-point iteration algorithm converges exponentially fast to the optimal solution in the number of iterations. Moreover, it numerically shows fast convergence compared to the off-the-shelf semidefinite program solvers. Our algorithm, for the specific case of Bures-Wasserstein barycenter, recovers the fixed-point iterative algorithm originally introduced in (\'Alvarez-Esteban et al., 2016). Our proof is concise and relies solely on matrix inequalities. Finally, we discuss several applications of our algorithm in quantum resource theories and quantum Shannon theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

      <title>Universal adapters between quantum LDPC codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the repetition code adapter as a way to perform joint logical Pauli measurements within a quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codeblock or between separate such codeblocks, thus providing a flexible tool for fault-tolerant computation with quantum LDPC codes. This adapter is universal in the sense that it works regardless of the LDPC codes involved and the logical Paulis being measured. The construction achieves joint logical Pauli measurement of $t$ weight $O(d)$ operators using $O(d)$ time and $\tilde O(td)$ additional qubits and checks, up to a factor polylogarithmic in $d$. As a special case, for some geometrically-local codes in fixed $D\ge2$ dimensions, only $O(td)$ additional qubits and checks are required instead. By extending the adapter in the case $t=2$, we also construct a toric code adapter that uses $O(d^2)$ additional qubits and checks to perform addressable logical CNOT gates on arbitrary LDPC codes via Dehn twists. To obtain these results, we develop a novel weaker form of graph edge expansion and the $\mathsf{SkipTree}$ algorithm, which ensures a sparse transformation between different weight-2 check bases for the classical repetition code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional paradigm of quantum computing is discrete: it utilizes discrete sets of gates to realize bitstring-to-bitstring mappings, some of them arguably intractable for classical computers. In parameterized quantum approaches, the input becomes continuous and the output represents real-valued functions. While the universality of discrete quantum computers is well understood, basic questions remained open in the continuous case. We focus on universality on multivariate functions. Current approaches require either a number of qubits scaling linearly with the dimension of the input for fixed encodings, or a tunable encoding procedure in single-qubit circuits. The question of whether universality can be reached with a fixed encoding and sub-linearly many qubits remained open for the last five years. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for arbitrary multivariate functions. We provide two methods: (i) a single-qubit circuit where each coordinate of the arguments to the function to represent is input independently, and (ii) a multi-qubit approach where all coordinates are input in one step, with number of qubits scaling logarithmically with the dimension of the argument of the function of interest. We view the first result of inherent and fundamental interest, whereas the second result opens the path towards representing functions whose arguments are densely encoded in a unitary operation, possibly encoding for instance quantum processes.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Mixer Allocation Algorithm for the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Hadfield et al. proposed the quantum alternating operator ansatz algorithm (QAOA+), an extension of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs). Compared with QAOA, QAOA+ enables the search for optimal solutions within a feasible solution space by encoding problem constraints into the mixer Hamiltonian, thereby reducing the search space and eliminating the possibility of yielding infeasible solutions. However, QAOA+ may incur high overall gate costs when the mixer is applied to all qubits in each layer, and each mixer is costly to implement. To address this challenge, an adaptive mixer allocation strategy is tailored for QAOA+. The resulting algorithm, which integrates this strategy into the original QAOA+ framework, is referred to as AMA-QAOA+. Unlike QAOA+, AMA-QAOA+ adaptively applies the mixer to a subset of qubits in each layer of the mixer unitary operator based on an evaluation function. The performance of AMA-QAOA+ is evaluated on the maximum independent set problem. Numerical simulation results show that, under the same number of optimization runs, AMA-QAOA+ achieves better solution quality than QAOA+, with the optimal approximation ratio improved by $5.30\%$ on ER random graphs and $5.41\%$ on 3-regular graphs. Moreover, AMA-QAOA+ significantly reduces the CNOT gate consumption, requiring only $15.30\%$ and $25.18\%$ of the CNOT gates used by QAOA+ on ER and 3-regular random graphs, respectively. These results demonstrate that AMA-QAOA+ enhances solution quality and computational efficiency, enabling the design of more compact and resource-efficient quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Criteria for Reducible Homogeneous Open Quantum Walks on the Line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the recurrence of Open Quantum Walks induced by finite-dimensional coins on the line ($\mathbb{Z}$) and on the grid ($\mathbb{Z}^2$). Two versions are considered: discrete-time open quantum walks (OQW) and continuous-time open quantum walks (CTOQW). We present three distinct recurrence criteria for OQWs on $\mathbb{Z}$, each adapted to different types of coins. The first criterion applies to coins whose auxiliary map has a unique invariant state, resulting in the first recurrence criterion for Lazy OQWs. The second one applies to Lazy OQWs of dimension 2, where we provide a complete characterization of the recurrence for this low-dimensional case. The third one presents a general criterion for finite-dimensional coins in the non-lazy case, which generalizes many of the previously known results for OQWs on $\mathbb{Z}$. Also, we present a general recurrence criterion for OQWs on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ via the open quantum jump chain, obtained from a recurrence criterion for CTOQWs on $\mathbb{Z}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, establishing provably tight bounds between them. We use these results to refine other divergence inequalities, in particular sharpening bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence nonstabilizerness spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Approximation Methods for Simulation and Equivalence Checking of Noisy Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, simulating and verifying noisy quantum circuits is crucial but faces challenges such as quantum state explosion and complex noise representations, constraining simulation and equivalence checking to circuits with a limited number of qubits. This paper introduces an approximation algorithm for simulating and assessing the equivalence of noisy quantum circuits, specifically designed to improve scalability under low-noise conditions. The approach utilizes a novel tensor network diagram combined with singular value decomposition to approximate the tensors of quantum noises. The implementation is based on Google's TensorNetwork Python package for contraction. Experimental results on realistic quantum circuits with realistic hardware noise models indicate that our algorithm can simulate and check the equivalence of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits with around 200 qubits and 20 noise operators, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in scalability and speed.</description>

      <title>Computing band gaps of periodic materials via sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key objective of computational solid state physics is to predict electronic properties of periodic materials. However, electronic structure simulations based on density functional theory fail to predict experimental results if correlations are not properly accounted for. Here, we report a sample-based quantum diagonalization workflow for simulating electronic states of periodic materials, and for predicting their band gaps. To that end, we devise a general lattice Hamiltonian representation in which material-specific, electronic interaction parameters are obtained self-consistently. Two exemplar, wide-gap materials - hafnium dioxide and zirconium dioxide - are expressed as quantum circuits that leverage the lattice representation with a materials-specific parametrization. We sample the quantum circuits on a state-of-the-art, superconducting quantum processor and diagonalize the lattice Hamiltonian in the reduced configuration subspaces with standard techniques. Our method outperforms select quantum-chemical benchmarks as well as approaches based on density functional theory, the standard reference in materials simulation of solids. Importantly, the quantum-computed band gap predictions for the two dielectrics agree with independent lab experiments. In essence, quantum-classical hybrid simulation workflows on pre-fault tolerant quantum computers produce useful, experimentally verifiable property predictions in applied materials science.</description>

      <title>A note on the quantum Wielandt inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</description>

      <title>Noisy simulations of Quantum Walk and Quantum Walk search via Quantum Cellular Automata on a semiconducting spin processor emulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we map NISQ-friendly implementations of the non-interacting QCA to a circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) hardware. We perform both noiseless and noisy simulations of the QCA one particle sector, namely the Quantum Walk, on $N$-cycles and $N \times N$ torus graphs. Moreover, within this framework, we also investigate the search problem and present a circuit for preparing the W state (i.e., the Dicke state with hamming weight one) using only N-1 $\sqrt{\text{iSWAP}}$ gates and no ancilla qubits. The noiseless simulations are conducted with the Qiskit Aer simulator, while the noisy simulations with C12 Quantum Electronics' in-house noisy emulator, \textit{Callisto}. We benchmark the performance of our implementations by analyzing the simulations via relevant metrics and quantities such as the state count distributions, the Hellinger Fidelity, the $\ell^{1}$ distance, the hitting time, and success probability. Our results demonstrate that the QCA framework, in combination with cQED processors, holds promise as an effective platform for early NISQ implementations of Quantum Walk and Quantum Walk Search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution with Polynomial Resources in Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution is fundamental for analyzing quantum many-body systems, yet classical simulation requires exponentially growing resources in both system size and evolution time. While quantum approaches reduce the system-size scaling, existing methods rely on heuristic techniques with measurement precision or success probability that deteriorates as evolution time increases. We present a quantum algorithm that prepares normalized imaginary-time evolved states using an adaptive normalization factor to maintain a stable success probability over long imaginary-time intervals. Our algorithm approximates the target state with error polynomially small in the inverse imaginary time using a polynomial number of elementary quantum gates and a single ancilla qubit, with success probability close to one. When the initial state has reasonable overlap with the ground state, this algorithm also achieves polynomial resource cost in the system size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical analysis for evolution time up to 50, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness for long-time evolution. Building on this technique, we further develop imaginary-time-evolution-based algorithms for ground-state-related problems and for simulating open quantum systems. These algorithms reduce circuit depth compared with existing methods and illustrate the effectiveness of imaginary-time evolution in early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gate Reordering for Distributed Quantum Compiling in Data Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Just as classical computing relies on distributed systems, the quantum computing era requires new kinds of infrastructure and software tools. Quantum networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution cost compared to a baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Local-Frame Covariance and the Relational Origin of Quantum Causal Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17075v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process-matrix framework models quantum correlations without assuming a predefined global causal order, yet its standard Choi-Jamiolkowski construction implicitly presupposes a globally aligned Hilbert-space basis across all local laboratories. This makes the formalism causally indefinite yet kinematically absolute. To achieve full relational consistency, we impose the principle of local frame independence: physical predictions must remain invariant under independent unitary redefinitions of each laboratory's local basis. We formalize this requirement as a local gauge symmetry and derive the corresponding covariant representation of any process by averaging over the symmetry group. The image of this twirling operation forms a strict subset of the cone of causally separable processes. Covariance thus enforces a superselection rule for causal order, showing that indefinite causal order is not an intrinsic feature of nature but a relational coherence that exists only relative to a physical system establishing a shared quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum-limited sub-Rayleigh identification of incoherent sources with arbitrary intensities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rayleigh diffraction limit imposes a fundamental restriction on the resolution of direct imaging systems, hindering the identification of incoherent optical sources, such as celestial bodies in astronomy and fluorophores in bioimaging. Recent advances in quantum sensing have shown that this limit can be circumvented through spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) and photon detection, i.e. a semi-classical detection strategy. However, the general optimality for arbitrary intensity distributions and bright sources remains unproven. In this work, we develop a general model for incoherent light with arbitrary intensity undergoing diffraction. We employ this framework to compute the quantum Chernoff exponent for generic incoherent-source discrimination problems, focusing on the sub-diffraction regime. We show that, surprisingly, SPADE measurements saturate the quantum Chernoff bound only when certain compatibility conditions are met. These findings suggest that collective measurements may actually be needed to achieve the ultimate quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of specific incoherent sources. For the fully general case, our analysis can still be used to find the best SPADE configurations, generally achieved through a rotation of the SPADE interferometer that depends on the discrimination task. We also simulated the efficiency of a simplified Bayesian test that we developed for this identification task and show that the saturation of the Chernoff bound is already achieved for a finite number of repetitions $N\leqslant 5000$. Our results advance the theory of quantum-limited optical discrimination, with possible applications in diagnostics, automated image interpretation, and galaxy identification.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the non-Clifford-count in unitary synthesis using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits, while optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly implementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. We have designed our RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T synthesis on two qubit unitaries achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. We illustrate significant reduction in the asymptotic T-count estimate of important primitives like controlled cyclic shift (43%), controlled adder (14.3%) and multiplier (14%), without adding any extra ancilla. For 2-qubit Clifford+CS unitaries, our algorithm achieves a linear complexity, something that could only be accomplished by a previous algorithm using SO(6) representation.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations for Reverse Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are analytical quantum stochastic differential equations for reverse diffusion, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. We show that the reverse processes generalize the forward dynamics by combining the noise effects of the forward processes with an additional non-Markovian stochastic drift that dynamically steers a quantum state back to its initial configuration. Consequently, the exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented in real-time without the need for variational techniques. Our findings establish an analytical framework for quantum state recovery, noise-resilient quantum gates, quantum generative modelling, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.</description>

      <title>Unified Bulk-Entanglement Correspondence in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) fundamentally invalidates the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), leading topological diagnostics into a crisis. While the non-Bloch polarization $P_{\beta}$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_{\beta}$ and the entanglement polarization $\chi$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_{\beta} \equiv \chi(\tilde{H})\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $\chi(\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demonstrating the practical utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for recurrent tasks in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery is of paramount importance. We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunable Josephson harmonics open new avenues for qubit design. We demonstrate a superconducting circuit element consisting of a tunnel junction in series with a SQUID loop, yielding a Josephson potential whose harmonic content is strongly tunable by magnetic flux. Through spectroscopy of the first four qubit transitions, together with an effective single-mode model renormalized by the internal mode, we resolve a second harmonic with an amplitude up to $\sim10\%$ of the fundamental. We identify a flux sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes, achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes. This highly tunable element provides a route toward protected qubits and customizable nonlinear microwave devices.</description>

      <title>Certified Private Quantum Time Ticks Away Faster than Any Classical Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an entangled clock, where the flow of time is operationally defined by the discrete registration of measurement outcomes on a singlet state. Comparing the synchronization rate of two such clocks against classical models, we find that at obtuse relative angles, the quantum clock ticks strictly faster than this classical benchmark. We further propose a protocol for Certified Private Time, adapting device-independent randomness certification to the temporal domain; this guarantees a sovereign timeline that ticks away faster than any local realistic mechanism allows.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

      <title>Topological aspects of periodically driven non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A non-Hermitian generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by a periodic external potential is investigated, and its topological features are explored. We find that the bi-orthonormal geometric phase acts as a topological index, well capturing the presence/absence of the zero modes. The model is observed to display trivial and non-trivial insulator phases and a topologically non-trivial M${\"o}$bius metallic phase. The driving field amplitude is shown to be a control parameter causing topological phase transitions in this model. While the system displays zero modes in the metallic phase apart from the non-trivial insulator phase, the metallic zero modes are not robust, as the ones found in the insulating phase. We further find that zero modes' energy converges slowly to zero as a function of the number of dimers in the M${\"o}$bius metallic phase compared to the non-trivial insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Unconditional correctness of recent quantum algorithms for factoring and computing discrete logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1994, Shor introduced his famous quantum algorithm to factor integers and compute discrete logarithms in polynomial time. In 2023, Regev proposed a multi-dimensional version of Shor's algorithm that requires far fewer quantum gates. His algorithm relies on a number-theoretic conjecture on the elements in $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ that can be written as short products of very small prime numbers. We prove a version of this conjecture using tools from analytic number theory such as zero-density estimates. As a result, we obtain an unconditional proof of correctness of this improved quantum algorithm and of subsequent variants.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $&gt; 400$-fold and $&gt; 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of nonlinear spin-wave propagation using diamond quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior at large amplitudes due to the competition between excitation and relaxation, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. This nonlinearity has been observed experimentally, for example in S. R. Lake et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 034010 (2022), but a quantitative comparison with theory has not yet been carried out. Here, We image nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase as a function of the excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, we observe modulation of the wavenumber across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to a reduction in the saturation magnetization caused by incoherent spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Holographic duality from Howe duality: Chern-Simons gravity as an ensemble of code CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the holographic correspondence between 3d "Chern-Simons gravity" and an ensemble of 2d Narain code CFTs. Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons theory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all possible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal non-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual error-correcting code over $\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to define a boundary "code CFT." The average over the ensemble of such theories is holographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d topologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces to that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincar\'e series akin to that in semiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the mathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and rigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This framework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups forming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the boundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other. Finally, we reformulate the holographic duality as an identity between different averages over quantum stabilizer states, providing an interpretation in terms of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation of Non-Adiabatic Molecular Dynamics with Precise Electronic Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of non-adiabatic chemical processes such as photocatalysis and photosynthesis, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is an indispensable theoretical tool, which requires precise potential energy surfaces (PESs) of ground and excited states. Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry.</description>

Abstract: In [Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234], De Palma and Trevisan described a one-to-one correspondence between quantum couplings and quantum channels realizing transport between states. The aim of this short note is to demonstrate that taking the Petz recovery map for a given channel and initial state is precisely the counterpart of the swap transpose operation on couplings. That is, the swap transpose of the coupling $\Pi_{\Phi}$ corresponding to the channel $\Phi$ and initial state $\rho$ is the coupling $\Pi_{rec}$ corresponding to the Petz recovery map $\Phi_{rec}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic preparation of arbitrary two-component product states of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an 8$\times$8 optical tweezer array, achieving motional ground-state fidelities above $98.5\,\%$. Leveraging the large differential magnetic moments for spin-resolution, with parallelized site- and number-resolved control, our approach addresses key challenges for low-entropy quantum state engineering. Combined with high-fidelity spin-, site-, and density-resolved readout within a single $20\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ exposure, and $3\,\mathrm{s}$ experimental cycles, these advances establish a fast, scalable, and programmable architecture for fermionic quantum simulation.</description>
