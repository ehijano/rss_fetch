      <title>Path Signatures Enable Model-Free Mapping of RNA Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting chemical modifications on RNA molecules remains a key challenge in epitranscriptomics. Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications. We further applyied this framework to dengue virus (DENV) transcripts and mammalian mRNAs. For DENV sfRNA, it led to revealing a novel 2'-O-methylated site, which we validate orthogonally by qRT-PCR assays. These results demonstrate that our model-free approach operates robustly across different types of RNAs and datasets generated with different nanopore sequencing chemistries.</description>

      <title>Partial domain adaptation enables cross domain cell type annotation between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation across datasets is a key challenge in single-cell analysis. snRNA-seq enables profiling of frozen or difficult-to-dissociate tissues, complementing scRNA-seq by capturing fragile or rare cell types. However, cross-annotation between these two datasets remains largely unexplored, as existing methods treat them independently. We introduce ScNucAdapt, the first method designed for cross-annotation between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets. To address distributional and cell composition differences, ScNucAdapt employs partial domain adaptation. Experiments across diverse samples show that ScNucAdapt achieves robust and accurate cell type annotation, outperforming existing approaches. Therefore, ScNucAdapt provides a practical framework for the cross-domain cell type annotation between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data.</description>

      <title>DeepVRegulome: DNABERT-based deep-learning framework for predicting the functional impact of short genomic variants on the human regulome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed numerous non-coding short variants whose functional impacts remain poorly understood. Despite recent advances in deep-learning genomic approaches, accurately predicting and prioritizing clinically relevant mutations in gene regulatory regions remains a major challenge. Here we introduce Deep VRegulome, a deep-learning method for prediction and interpretation of functionally disruptive variants in the human regulome, which combines 700 DNABERT fine-tuned models, trained on vast amounts of ENCODE gene regulatory regions, with variant scoring, motif analysis, attention-based visualization, and survival analysis. We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via non-coding mutation signatures. All the code, fine-tuned models, and an interactive data portal are publicly available.</description>
