      <title>Ground state properties and bubble structure of the isotopic chains of Z = 125 and 126 using the relativistic mean-field formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state properties of Z = 125 and 126 nuclei are investigated, taking the isotopic series from the proton to neutron drip-lines. This analysis is conducted using the relativistic mean-field approach with NL3 and the Relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov model with DD-ME2 parameterization. The bulk properties under examination include the binding energy, the neutron separation energies, the differential variation of the separation energy, the quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta_2$, and the single-particle energy. We observed the stability at N = 172 and 184 over the isotopic chain for both parameter sets. The quadrupole deformation parameter reveals a shape transition from prolate to spherical and back to prolate with mass number. No signature of a super- and/or hyper-deformed structure is found over the isotopic chain. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to examine the bubble structure, revealing a bubble/semi-bubble structure for a few neutron-rich isotopes.</description>

      <title>Inclusive studies of two- and three-nucleon short-range correlations in $^3$H and $^3$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inclusive electron scattering at carefully chosen kinematics can isolate scattering from short-range correlations (SRCs), produced through hard, short-distance interactions of nucleons in the nucleus. Because the two-nucleon (2N) SRCs arise from the same N-N interaction in all nuclei, the cross section in the SRC-dominated regime is identical up to an overall scaling factor, and the A/2H cross section ratio is constant in this region. This scaling behavior has been used to identify SRC dominance and to map out the contribution of SRCs for a wide range of nuclei. We examine this scaling behavior at lower momentum transfers using new data on $^2$H, $^3$H, and $^3$He which show that the scaling region is larger than in heavy nuclei. Based on the improved scaling, especially for $^3$H/$^3$He, we examine the ratios at kinematics where three-nucleon SRCs may play an important role. The data for the largest initial nucleon momenta are consistent with isolation of scattering from 3N-SRCs, and suggest that the very-highest momentum nucleons in $^3$He have a nearly isospin-independent momentum configuration, or a small enhancement of the proton distribution.</description>

      <title>Low-mass dark sector searches with deuteron photodisintegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen much activity in searches for dark-sector messenger particles in the 10-100 MeV mass range, especially in view of a potential new light boson conjectured by the ATOMKI collaboration, X17. Under the assumption that the messenger particle has definite parity and either zero or unit spin, quite stringent bounds already exist on its coupling to electrons and protons. Equally stringent bounds on the neutron coupling do not exist yet, but are nonetheless desirable. We explore how measurements of deuteron photodisintegration with a quasi-free neutron can yield bounds on the neutron coupling, and compute projections for a potential measurement at the lowenergy high-intensity electron scattering experiment MAGIX@MESA. The projected bounds are found to be competitive for an axial-vector or pseudoscalar scenario, but not for a vector or scalar scenario.</description>

      <title>Neutrino many-body flavor evolution: the full Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino flavor evolution in the quantum many-body approach using the full neutrino-neutrino Hamiltonian, including the usually neglected terms that mediate non-forward scattering processes. Working in the occupation number representation with plane waves as single-particle states, we explore the time evolution of simple initial states with up to $N=10$ neutrinos. We discuss the time evolution of the Loschmidt echo, one body flavor and kinetic observables, and the one-body entanglement entropy. For the small systems considered, we observe `thermalization' of both flavor and momentum degrees of freedom on comparable time scales, with results converging towards expectation values computed within a microcanonical ensemble. We also observe that the inclusion of non-forward processes generates a faster flavor evolution compared to the one induced by the truncated (forward) Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Thermalization at the femtoscale seen in high-energy Pb+Pb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A collision between two atomic nuclei accelerated at a speed close to that of light creates a dense system of quarks and gluons. Interactions among them are so strong that they behave collectively like a droplet of fluid of ten-femtometer size, which expands into the vacuum and eventually fragments into thousands of particles. We report a new manifestation of thermalization in recent data from the Large Hadron Collider. Our analysis is based on results from the ATLAS Collaboration, which has measured the variance of the momentum per particle across Pb+Pb collision events with the same particle multiplicity. This variance decreases steeply over a narrow multiplicity range corresponding to central collisions. We provide a simple explanation of this newly-observed phenomenon: For a given multiplicity, the momentum per particle increases with increasing impact parameter. Since a larger impact parameter goes along with a smaller collision volume, this in turn implies that the momentum per particle increases as a function of density, which is a generic consequence of thermalization. Our analysis provides the first direct evidence of this phenomenon at the femtoscale.</description>

      <title>Is the compact object associated with HESS J1731-347 a strange quark star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 suggests that it has a small radius and, even more interestingly, a mass of the order or smaller than one solar mass. This raises the question of which astrophysical process could lead to such a small mass, since the analysis of various types of SN explosions indicate that is it not possible to produce a neutron star with a mass smaller than about $1.17 M_\odot$. Here we show that masses of the order or smaller than one solar mass can be obtained in the case of strange quark stars and that it is possible to build a coherent model explaining not only the mass and the radius of that object, but also its slow cooling suggested in various analyses. We also show that an astrophysical path exists which leads to the formation of such an object, and we discuss the role played in that scenario by strangelets assumed to constitute the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Medium-induced photon bremsstrahlung in neutrino-nucleus, antineutrino-nucleus, and electron-nucleus scattering from multiple QED interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions of charged leptons with nuclei and the naive tree-level kinematics of these processes are affected by radiation of photons induced by the QED nuclear medium. We evaluate cross-section modifications at leading orders of the number of correlated interactions inside the nucleus, known as the opacity expansion. We derive results for soft and collinear types of the bremsstrahlung at the first three orders in opacity and generalize them to higher orders. We present the leading in opacity energy spectra of soft and collinear photons and radiative energy loss inside the nucleus for experiments with lepton kinematics in the GeV energy range. At leading power of the Glauber soft-collinear effective field theory, the soft radiation is further resummed to all orders both in opacity and in the electromagnetic coupling constant. We find that the soft and collinear medium-induced radiation is vacuumlike, and additional corrections are power suppressed. Despite the negligible modification to the induced photon spectra, the nuclear medium-induced radiation sizably affects the broadening of charged leptons in the direction orthogonal to their propagation.</description>
