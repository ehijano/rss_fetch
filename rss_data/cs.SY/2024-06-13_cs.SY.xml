      <title>Regularizing Numerical Extremals Along Singular Arcs: A Lie-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical ``direct'' approaches to time-optimal control often fail to find solutions that are singular in the sense of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, performing better when searching for saturated (bang-bang) solutions. In previous work by one of the authors, singular solutions were shown to exist for the time-optimal control problem for fully actuated mechanical systems under hard torque constraints. Explicit formulas, based on a Lie theoretic analysis of the problem, were given for singular segments of trajectories, but the global structure of solutions remains unknown. In this work, we review the aforementioned framework, and show how to effectively combine these formulas with the use of general-purpose optimal control software packages. By using the explicit formula given by the theory in the intervals where the numerical solution enters a singular arc, we not only obtain an algebraic expression for the control in that interval but we are also able to remove artifacts present in the numerical solution. In this way, the best features of numerical algorithms and theory complement each other and provide a better picture of the global optimal structure. We illustrate the technique on a two degree of freedom robotic arm example, using two distinct optimal control numerical software packages running on different programming languages.</description>

      <title>Broadband MEMS Microphone Arrays with Reduced Aperture Through 3D-Printed Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a passive and cost-effective method for increasing the frequency range of ultrasound MEMS microphone arrays when using beamforming techniques. By applying a 3D-printed construction that reduces the acoustic aperture of the MEMS microphones we can create a regularly spaced microphone array layout with much smaller inter-element spacing than could be accomplished on a printed circuit board due to the physical size of the MEMS elements. This method allows the use of ultrasound sensors incorporating microphone arrays in combination with beamforming techniques without aliases due to grating lobes in applications such as sound source localization or the emulation of bat HRTFs.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a Quadrotor via Energy Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilization of a quadrotor without a controller based on cascade structure is a challenging problem. Besides, due to the dynamics and the number of underactuation, an energy shaping controller has not been designed in 3D for a quadrotor. This paper presents a novel solution to the potential energy shaping problem for a quadrotor utilizing the Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) approach. For the first time, we extend the solution of PDEs from the 2D case to the full 3D scenario. This advancement seems to be a significant step forward for stabilization of underactuated aerial vehicles without a cascade controller. The results are verified via simulation on a typical quadrotor.</description>

      <title>Active Sidestick Control Integration for Enhanced Aircraft Flight Envelope Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of Envelope and Pilot-Induced Oscillation (PIO) Protection Features, and Failure Cases detection and prevention using Active Control Sidestick (ACS) is a challenging task. While helping the pilot to respect the envelope limitations also in failure scenarios and, therefore, increasing mission effectiveness, these features may have a significant impact on the aircraft's agility. ACS characteristics are investigated in an integrated environment. A set of effective and flexible control laws based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion have been developed in a state-of-the-art aircraft simulation model and coupled with a two-ways communication with the selected ACS. The model can run in real-time in a fixed-based simulator composed of representative cockpit and out-of-the-window.</description>

      <title>A Set Cover Mapping Heuristic for Demand-Robust Fleet Size Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Compatibility Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the demand-robust fleet size vehicle routing problem with time windows and compatibility constraints. Unlike traditional robust optimization, which considers uncertainty in the data, demand-robust optimization considers uncertainty in which constraints must be satisfied. This paper is the first to solve a practical demand-robust optimization problem at large scale. We present an MILP formulation and also propose a heuristic that maps the problem to set cover in polynomial time. We show that under modest assumptions the relative difference in time complexity from a standard branch-and-bound algorithm to the proposed heuristic scales exponentially with the size of the problem. We evaluate our heuristic using a simulation case study on the Solomon benchmark instances for a variety of practical problem sizes, and compare with Gurobi. The empirical approximation ratio remains below 2.0.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Acoustic Losses in Interdigitated VHF to mmWave Piezoelectric M/NEMS Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports on a technology-agnostic and frequency-independent methodology combining a-priori modeling, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and experimental results for the characterization of acoustic losses in interdigitated piezoelectric micro- and nano-electromechanical (M/NEMS) resonators. The proposed approach models the mechanical quality factor (Qm) and its dependency on piezoelectric (Qpiezo) and metal (Qmetal) acoustic losses, as a function of the mode of vibration dispersion characteristics. The model is finally experimentally validated by exploiting the intrinsic on-chip multifrequency manufacturability of interdigitated devices. A broad range of available resonator technologies, frequencies, and piezoelectric materials are investigated for this purpose, including bulk X-cut Lithium Niobate (XLN) leaky surface acoustic wave resonators operating at Ultra High Frequency (UHF), thin film XLN Lamb Wave resonators spanning between Very High Frequency (VHF) and the Ku band, and Aluminum Nitride (AlN) and scandium-doped AlN (ScAlN) cross-sectional lame' mode resonators ranging from the Ku to Ka band (mmWave).</description>

      <title>Research on Comprehensive Optimization Design of CNC Machine Tool Feed System Considering Subsystem Coupling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feed system of CNC machine tools is critical in determining machining accuracy. Current design methods often utilize lightweight and structural optimization to enhance natural frequencies or restrict the load-to-inertia ratio to ensure dynamic performance. However, it is challenging to determine whether these methods can meet accuracy requirements during the design phase. This paper proposes using position and velocity errors as design criteria to meet accuracy requirements during the design phase. However, the feed system of CNC machine tools is influenced by various subsystems. Still, comprehensive research on the coupling effects of these subsystems and their integrated impact on dynamic performance is currently lacking. This paper addresses this issue by comprehensively studying the integrated effects of various subsystems on the dynamic performance of the feed system. It proposes comprehensive optimization design criteria for the dynamic design of the feed system of CNC machine tools. First, the influence of the control system is isolated using intelligent optimization algorithms. Then, the influence mechanisms of motor and mechanical structure parameters on the dynamic performance of the feed system under different motion processes are studied. Finally, based on the integrated effects of coupling between subsystems on feed system performance, a comprehensive optimization design criteria for the feed system of CNC machine tools considering the coupling effects of various subsystems is proposed. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the dynamic design of machine tool feed systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Enhanced Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Management via Digital Twin: Opportunities, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a digital twin (DT)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at optimizing performance and reliability in network resource management, since the traditional RL methods face several unified challenges when applied to physical networks, including limited exploration efficiency, slow convergence, poor long-term performance, and safety concerns during the exploration phase. To deal with the above challenges, a comprehensive DT-based framework is proposed to enhance the convergence speed and performance for unified RL-based resource management. The proposed framework provides safe action exploration, more accurate estimates of long-term returns, faster training convergence, higher convergence performance, and real-time adaptation to varying network conditions. Then, two case studies on ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) network are presented, demonstrating improvements of the proposed framework in performance, convergence speed, and training cost reduction both on traditional RL and neural network based Deep RL (DRL). Finally, the article identifies and explores some of the research challenges and open issues in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Iterative method for real-time Hybrid testing: application to a cantilever beam with two interface degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an iterative method for real-time hybrid testing (RTHT) is proposed. The method seeks to iteratively balance the interface conditions between the physical and numerical substructures by controlling the periodic demand of the actuators. It is then suitable for RTHT of structures undergoing a periodic response, e.g. structures excited at resonance. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method on a cantilever beam in bending motion with two degrees of freedom at the interface, which we use as a prototype for future testing of aircraft wings. We show that a number of challenges arise in these settings, such as the difficulty in measuring interface forces while controlling a continuous structure and the instability of the hybrid test for small time delays. Classical RTHT strategies could produce inaccurate or unstable outcomes, whereas the proposed method is able to attain very good interface synchronisation in a wide range of tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Traffic Signal Cycle Control with Centralized Critic and Decentralized Actors under Varying Intervention Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban areas is a significant problem, leading to prolonged travel times, reduced efficiency, and increased environmental concerns. Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is a key strategy for reducing congestion. Unlike most TSC systems that rely on high-frequency control, this study introduces an innovative joint phase traffic signal cycle control method that operates effectively with varying control intervals. Our method features an adjust all phases action design, enabling simultaneous phase changes within the signal cycle, which fosters both immediate stability and sustained TSC effectiveness, especially at lower frequencies. The approach also integrates decentralized actors to handle the complexity of the action space, with a centralized critic to ensure coordinated phase adjusting. Extensive testing on both synthetic and real-world data across different intersection types and signal setups shows that our method significantly outperforms other popular techniques, particularly at high control intervals. Case studies of policies derived from traffic data further illustrate the robustness and reliability of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Static ISAC based on Network-Assisted Full-Duplex Cell-Free Networks: Performance Analysis and Duplex Mode Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, which can achieve a wider coverage range and avoid self-interference, is an important trend for the future development of ISAC. Existing multi-static ISAC designs are unable to support the asymmetric uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) communication requirements in the scenario while simultaneously achieving optimal sensing performance. This paper proposes a design for multi-static ISAC based on network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free networks can well solve the above problems. Under this design, closed-form expressions for the individual comunication rate and localization error rate are derived under imperfect channel state information, which are respectively utilized to assess the communication and sensing performances. Then, we propose a deep Q-network-based accesss point (AP) duplex mode optimization algorithm to obtain the trade-off between communication and sensing from the UL and DL perspectives of the APs. Simulation results demonstrate that the NAFD-based ISAC system proposed in this paper can achieve significantly better communication performance than other ISAC systems while ensuring minimal impact on sensing performance. Then, we validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions. Furthermore, the proposed optimization algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of the exhaustion method with low complexity.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Safety Analysis and Design of ADAS and ADS: Implications on Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, a major concern is the insufficient level of safety offered by commercial automated vehicles and/or services such self-driving vehicles, self-driving trucks, and robotaxis. Unfortunately, stakeholders do not agree on definitions and characterizations of what is meant by safety of automated vehicles including how to measure it and how to design for it. This paper sheds some light into the answers to important questions about the safety of automated vehicles. In addition, we identify rigor as a significant missing requirement in the current literature, we also provide a discussion of rigor in the design, development, and commercialization of automated vehicles. Furthermore, we discuss software tool requirements at the organizational level to support a rigorous approach for the analysis, design, and commercialization of automated vehicles. An ALM tool, EwQIMS, is introduced emphasizing its rigorous features of its functional safety module that implements much of the ISO 26262 standard.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Nonlinear Magnetic Equivalent Circuit for Design and Fast Analysis of Radial Flux Magnetic Gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic gears offer advantages over mechanical gears, including contactless power transfer, but require robust analysis tools for optimization and commercialization. This study proposes a rapid and accurate 2D nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for radial flux magnetic gears (RFMG). The model, featuring a parameterized gear geometry and adjustable flux tube distribution, accommodates nonlinear effects like magnetic saturation while maintaining quick simulation times. Comparison with a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) model demonstrates the MEC's accuracy in torque and flux density predictions across diverse designs. Additionally, a parametric optimization study of 140,000 designs confirms the MEC's high accuracy, achieving close agreement with FEA torque predictions, with simulations running up to 100 times faster. Finally, the MEC shows good agreement with 2D FEA for a prototype RFMG.</description>

      <title>After the Breach: Incident Response within Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprises are constantly under attack from sophisticated adversaries. These adversaries use a variety of techniques to first gain access to the enterprise, then spread laterally inside its networks, establish persistence, and finally exfiltrate sensitive data, or hold it for ransom. While historically, enterprises have used different Incident Response systems that monitor hosts, servers, or network devices to detect and report threats, these systems often need many analysts to triage and respond to alerts. However, the immense quantity of alerts to sift through, combined with the potential risk of missing a valid threat makes the task of the analyst challenging. To ease this manual and laborious process, researchers have proposed a variety of systems that perform automated attack investigations. These systems collect data, track causally related events, and present the analyst with an interpretable summary of the attack. In this paper, we present a survey of systems that perform automated attack investigation, and compare them based on their designs, goals, and heuristics. We discuss the challenges faced by these systems, and present a comparison in terms of their effectiveness, practicality, and ability to address these challenges. We conclude by discussing the future of these systems, and the open problems in this area.</description>

      <title>Visibility-Aware RRT* for Safety-Critical Navigation of Perception-Limited Robots in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe autonomous navigation in unknown environments remains a critical challenge for robots with limited sensing capabilities. While safety-critical control techniques, such as Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), have been proposed to ensure safety, their effectiveness relies on the assumption that the robot has complete knowledge of its surroundings. In reality, robots often operate with restricted field-of-view and finite sensing range, which can lead to collisions with unknown obstacles if the planning algorithm is agnostic to these limitations. To address this issue, we introduce the visibility-aware RRT* algorithm that combines sampling-based planning with CBFs to generate safe and efficient global reference paths in partially unknown environments. The algorithm incorporates a collision avoidance CBF and a novel visibility CBF, which guarantees that the robot remains within locally collision-free regions, enabling timely detection and avoidance of unknown obstacles. We conduct extensive experiments interfacing the path planners with two different safety-critical controllers, wherein our method outperforms all other compared baselines across both safety and efficiency aspects.</description>

      <title>Fully Adaptive Regret-Guaranteed Algorithm for Control of Linear Quadratic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first algorithm for the Linear Quadratic (LQ) control problem with an unknown system model, featuring a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, was introduced by Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesv\'ari (2011). Recognizing the computational complexity of this algorithm, subsequent efforts (see Cohen et al. (2019), Mania et al. (2019), Faradonbeh et al. (2020a), and Kargin et al.(2022)) have been dedicated to proposing algorithms that are computationally tractable while preserving this order of regret. Although successful, the existing works in the literature lack a fully adaptive exploration-exploitation trade-off adjustment and require a user-defined value, which can lead to overall regret bound growth with some factors. In this work, noticing this gap, we propose the first fully adaptive algorithm that controls the number of policy updates (i.e., tunes the exploration-exploitation trade-off) and optimizes the upper-bound of regret adaptively. Our proposed algorithm builds on the SDP-based approach of Cohen et al. (2019) and relaxes its need for a horizon-dependant warm-up phase by appropriately tuning the regularization parameter and adding an adaptive input perturbation. We further show that through careful exploration-exploitation trade-off adjustment there is no need to commit to the widely-used notion of strong sequential stability, which is restrictive and can introduce complexities in initialization.</description>

      <title>GAPses: Versatile smart glasses for comfortable and fully-dry acquisition and parallel ultra-low-power processing of EEG and EOG</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in head-mounted wearable technology are revolutionizing the field of biopotential measurement, but the integration of these technologies into practical, user-friendly devices remains challenging due to issues with design intrusiveness, comfort, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPSES, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom fully dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 uJ. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 24 uJ per inference and a total system power of only 16.28 mW, allowing for continuous operation of more than 12 h with a small 75 mAh battery.</description>

Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) for linear systems utilizes data matrices of recorded trajectories to directly predict new system trajectories, which is very appealing for real-life applications. In this paper we leverage the universal approximation properties of neural networks (NNs) to develop neural DeePC algorithms for nonlinear systems. Firstly, we point out that the outputs of the last hidden layer of a deep NN implicitly construct a basis in a so-called neural (feature) space, while the output linear layer performs affine interpolation in the neural space. As such, we can train off-line a deep NN using large data sets of trajectories to learn the neural basis and compute on-line a suitable affine interpolation using DeePC. Secondly, methods for guaranteeing consistency of neural DeePC and for reducing computational complexity are developed. Several neural DeePC formulations are illustrated on a nonlinear pendulum example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensors play a fundamental role in achieving the complex behaviors typically found in biological organisms. However, their potential role in the design of artificial agents is often overlooked. This often results in the design of robots that are poorly adapted to the environment, compared to their biological counterparts. This paper proposes a formalization of a novel architectural component, called a metasensor, which enables a process of sensor evolution reminiscent of what occurs in living organisms. Even in online scenarios, the metasensor layer searches for the optimal interpretation of its input signals and then feeds them to the robotic agent to accomplish the assigned task.</description>

      <title>Efficient Communication and Powering for Smart Contact Lens with Resonant Magneto-Quasistatic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-coil wearable system is proposed for wireless communication and powering between a transmitter coil in a necklace and a receiver coil in a smart contact lens, where the necklace is invisible in contrast to coils embedded in wearables like spectacles or headbands. Magneto-quasistatic(MQS) field coupling facilitates communication between the transmitter in the necklace and the contact lens receiver, enabling AR/VR and health monitoring. As long as the receiver coil remains within the magnetic field generated by the transmitter, continuous communication is sustained through MQS field coupling despite the misalignments present. Resonant frequency tuning enhances system efficiency. The system's performance was tested for coil misalignments, showing a maximum path loss variation within $10 dB$ across scenarios, indicating robustness. Finite Element Method(FEM) analysis has been used to study the system for efficient wireless data transfer and powering. A communication channel capacity is $4.5 Mbps$ over a $1 MHz$ bandwidth. Simulations show negligible path loss differences with or without human tissues, as magnetic coupling remains unaffected at MQS frequencies below $30 MHz$ due to similar magnetic permeability of tissues and air. Therefore, the possibility of efficient communication and powering of smart contact lenses through a necklace is shown for the first time using resonant MQS coupling at an axial distance of $15cm$ and lateral distance of over $9cm$ to enable AR/VR and health monitoring on the contact lens.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Task-Constrained Motion Planning for Collaborative Robots in Intelligent Remanufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial manipulators have extensively collaborated with human operators to execute tasks, e.g., disassembly of end-of-use products, in intelligent remanufacturing. A safety task execution requires real-time path planning for the manipulator's end-effector to autonomously avoid human operators. This is even more challenging when the end-effector needs to follow a planned path while avoiding the collision between the manipulator body and human operators, which is usually computationally expensive and limits real-time application. This paper proposes an efficient hybrid motion planning algorithm that consists of an A$^*$ algorithm and an online manipulator reconfiguration mechanism (OMRM) to tackle such challenges in task and configuration spaces respectively. The A$^*$ algorithm is first leveraged to plan the shortest collision-free path of the end-effector in task space. When the manipulator body is risky to the human operator, our OMRM then selects an alternative joint configuration with minimum reconfiguration effort from a database to assist the manipulator to follow the planned path and avoid the human operator simultaneously. The database of manipulator reconfiguration establishes the relationship between the task and configuration space offline using forward kinematics, and is able to provide multiple reconfiguration candidates for a desired end-effector's position. The proposed new hybrid algorithm plans safe manipulator motion during the whole task execution. Extensive numerical and experimental studies, as well as comparison studies between the proposed one and the state-of-the-art ones, have been conducted to validate the proposed motion planning algorithm.</description>

Abstract: This note studies the exponential convergence of input-output signals of discrete-time nonlinear systems composed of a feedback interconnection of a linear time-invariant system and a nonlinear uncertainty. Both the open-loop subsystems are allowed to be unbounded. Integral-quadratic-constraint-based conditions are proposed for these uncertain feedback systems, including the Lurye type, to exhibit the property that the endogenous input-output signals enjoy an exponential convergence rate for all initial conditions of the linear time-invariant subsystem. The conditions are established via a combination of tools, including integral quadratic constraints, directed gap, and exponential weightings.</description>

      <title>Learning Provably Stable Local Volt/Var Controllers for Efficient Network Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven framework to synthesize local Volt/Var control strategies for distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution networks (DNs). Aiming to improve DN operational efficiency, as quantified by a generic optimal reactive power flow (ORPF) problem, we propose a two-stage approach. The first stage involves learning the manifold of optimal operating points determined by an ORPF instance. To synthesize local Volt/Var controllers, the learning task is partitioned into learning local surrogates (one per DER) of the optimal manifold with voltage input and reactive power output. Since these surrogates characterize efficient DN operating points, in the second stage, we develop local control schemes that steer the DN to these operating points. We identify the conditions on the surrogates and control parameters to ensure that the locally acting controllers collectively converge, in a global asymptotic sense, to a DN operating point agreeing with the local surrogates. We use neural networks to model the surrogates and enforce the identified conditions in the training phase. AC power flow simulations on the IEEE 37-bus network empirically bolster the theoretical stability guarantees obtained under linearized power flow assumptions. The tests further highlight the optimality improvement compared to prevalent benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed MPC for Self-Organized Cooperation of Multiagent Systems -- Extended Version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sequential distributed model predictive control (MPC) scheme for cooperative control of multi-agent systems with dynamically decoupled heterogeneous nonlinear agents subject to individual constraints. In the scheme, we explore the idea of using tracking MPC with artificial references to let agents coordinate their cooperation without external guidance. Each agent combines a tracking MPC with artificial references, the latter penalized by a suitable coupling cost. They solve an individual optimization problem for this artificial reference and an input that tracks it, only communicating the former to its neighbors in a communication graph. This puts the cooperative problem on a different layer than the handling of the dynamics and constraints, loosening the connection between the two. We provide sufficient conditions on the formulation of the cooperative problem and the coupling cost for the closed-loop system to asymptotically achieve it. Since the dynamics and the cooperative problem are only loosely connected, classical results from distributed optimization can be used to this end. We illustrate the scheme's application to consensus and formation control.</description>

      <title>Reducing End-to-End Latencies of Multi-Rate Cause-Effect Chains in Safety Critical Embedded Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Logical Execution Time (LET) model has deterministic timing and data-flow properties, which simplify the computation of end-to-end latencies of multi-rate cause-effect chains. However, the LET model results in pessimistic end-to-end latencies since it abstracts the underlying platform and scheduling choices. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce end-to-end latencies of multi-rate cause-effect chains applying the LET model, by considering knowledge of the schedule in later design phases of safety critical embedded systems. Our method shortens and shifts the communication intervals of the LET model. If needed, e.g., for legacy reasons, our method can be applied to a subset of tasks only. We evaluate our work based on automotive benchmarks and synthetic task sets. We compare our results with previous work and the LET model. The experiments show significant reductions of maximum reaction time and data age values.</description>

      <title>On $\ell_2$-performance of weakly-hard real-time control systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers control systems with failures in the feedback channel, that occasionally lead to loss of the control input signal. A useful approach for modeling such failures is to consider window-based constraints on possible loss sequences, for example that at least r control attempts in every window of s are successful. A powerful framework to model such constraints are weakly-hard real-time constraints. Various approaches for stability analysis and the synthesis of stabilizing controllers for such systems have been presented in the past. However, existing results are mostly limited to asymptotic stability and rarely consider performance measures such as the resulting $\ell_2$-gain. To address this problem, we adapt a switched system description where the switching sequence is constrained by a graph that captures the loss information. We present an approach for $\ell_2$-performance analysis involving linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Further, leveraging a system lifting method, we propose an LMI-based approach for synthesizing state-feedback controllers with guaranteed $\ell_2$-performance. The results are illustrated by a numerical example.</description>

Abstract: Identifying and suppressing unknown disturbances to dynamical systems is a problem with applications in many different fields. Here we present a model-free method to identify and suppress an unknown disturbance to an unknown system based only on previous observations of the system under the influence of a known forcing function. We find that, under very mild restrictions on the training function, our method is able to robustly identify and suppress a large class of unknown disturbances. We illustrate our scheme with the identification of both deterministic and stochastic unknown disturbances to an analog electric chaotic circuit and with a numerical example where a chaotic disturbance to the Lorenz system is identified and suppressed.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers Learn Optimal Filtering for Unknown Systems?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models have shown great success in natural language processing; however, their potential remains mostly unexplored for dynamical systems. In this work, we investigate the optimal output estimation problem using transformers, which generate output predictions using all the past ones. Particularly, we train the transformer using various distinct systems and then evaluate the performance on unseen systems with unknown dynamics. Empirically, the trained transformer adapts exceedingly well to different unseen systems and even matches the optimal performance given by the Kalman filter for linear systems. In more complex settings with non-i.i.d. noise, time-varying dynamics, and nonlinear dynamics like a quadrotor system with unknown parameters, transformers also demonstrate promising results. To support our experimental findings, we provide statistical guarantees that quantify the amount of training data required for the transformer to achieve a desired excess risk. Finally, we point out some limitations by identifying two classes of problems that lead to degraded performance, highlighting the need for caution when using transformers for control and estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online tracking in linear control systems, where the objective is to follow a moving target. Unlike classical tracking control, the target is unknown, non-stationary, and its state is revealed sequentially, thus, fitting the framework of online non-stochastic control. We consider the case of quadratic costs and propose a new algorithm, called predictive linear online tracking (PLOT). The algorithm uses recursive least squares with exponential forgetting to learn a time-varying dynamic model of the target. The learned model is used in the optimal policy under the framework of receding horizon control. We show the dynamic regret of PLOT scales with $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{TV_T})$, where $V_T$ is the total variation of the target dynamics and $T$ is the time horizon. Unlike prior work, our theoretical results hold for non-stationary targets. We implement PLOT on a real quadrotor and provide open-source software, thus, showcasing one of the first successful applications of online control methods on real hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic congestion in metropolitan areas presents a formidable challenge with far-reaching economic, environmental, and societal ramifications. Therefore, effective congestion management is imperative, with traffic signal control (TSC) systems being pivotal in this endeavor. Conventional TSC systems, designed upon rule-based algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL), frequently exhibit deficiencies in managing the complexities and variabilities of urban traffic flows, constrained by their limited capacity for adaptation to unfamiliar scenarios. In response to these limitations, this work introduces an innovative approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into TSC, harnessing their advanced reasoning and decision-making faculties. Specifically, a hybrid framework that augments LLMs with a suite of perception and decision-making tools is proposed, facilitating the interrogation of both the static and dynamic traffic information. This design places the LLM at the center of the decision-making process, combining external traffic data with established TSC methods. Moreover, a simulation platform is developed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The findings from our simulations attest to the system's adeptness in adjusting to a multiplicity of traffic environments without the need for additional training. Notably, in cases of Sensor Outage (SO), our approach surpasses conventional RL-based systems by reducing the average waiting time by $20.4\%$. This research signifies a notable advance in TSC strategies and paves the way for the integration of LLMs into real-world, dynamic scenarios, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traffic management.

Abstract: This paper delves into a rendezvous scenario involving a chaser and a target spacecraft, focusing on the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to design a controller capable of guiding the chaser toward the target. The operational principle of spacecraft thrusters, requiring a minimum activation time that leads to the existence of a control deadband, introduces mixed-integer constraints into the optimization, posing a considerable computational challenge due to the exponential complexity on the number of integer constraints. We address this complexity by presenting two solver algorithms that efficiently approximate the optimal solution in significantly less time than standard solvers, making them well-suited for real-time applications.</description>

Abstract: The equivalent external noise temperature of time-varying antennas is studied using the concept of cross-frequency effective aperture, which quantifies the intermodulation conversion of external noise across the frequency spectrum into a receiver's operational bandwidth. The theoretical tools for this approach are laid out following the classical method for describing external noise temperature of linear time-invariant antennas, with generalizations made along the way to capture the effects of time-varying components or materials. The results demonstrate the specific ways that a time-varying system's noise characteristics are dependent on its cross-frequency effective aperture and the broadband noise environment. The general theory is applied to several examples, including abstract models of hypothetical systems, antennas integrated with parametric amplification, and time-modulated arrays.</description>

      <title>Stability-Constrained Learning for Frequency Regulation in Power Grids with Variable Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of converter-based renewable generation has resulted in faster frequency dynamics, and low and variable inertia. As a result, there is a need for frequency control methods that are able to stabilize a disturbance in the power system at timescales comparable to the fast converter dynamics. This paper proposes a combined linear and neural network controller for inverter-based primary frequency control that is stable at time-varying levels of inertia. We model the time-variance in inertia via a switched affine hybrid system model. We derive stability certificates for the proposed controller via a quadratic candidate Lyapunov function. We test the proposed control on a 12-bus 3-area test network, and compare its performance with a base case linear controller, optimized linear controller, and finite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Our proposed controller achieves faster mean settling time and over 50% reduction in average control cost across $100$ inertia scenarios compared to the optimized linear controller. Unlike LQR which requires complete knowledge of the inertia trajectories and system dynamics over the entire control time horizon, our proposed controller is real-time tractable, and achieves comparable performance to LQR.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Flight Envelope Protection: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a flight envelope protection algorithm on a longitudinal axis that leverages reinforcement learning (RL). By considering limits on variables such as angle of attack, load factor, and pitch rate, the algorithm counteracts excessive pilot or control commands with restoring actions. Unlike traditional methods requiring manual tuning, RL facilitates the approximation of complex functions within the trained model, streamlining the design process. This study demonstrates the promising results of RL in enhancing flight envelope protection, offering a novel and easy-to-scale method for safety-ensured flight.</description>

      <title>Interference Mitigation using Optimized Angle Diversity Receiver in LiFi Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-fidelity (LiFi) is an emerging technology for high-speed short-range mobile communications. Inter-cell interference (ICI) is an important issue that limits the system performance in an optical attocell network. Angle diversity receivers (ADRs) have been proposed to mitigate ICI. In this paper, the structure of pyramid receivers (PRs) and truncated pyramid receivers (TPRs) are studied. The coverage problems of PRs and TPRs are defined and investigated, and the lower bound of field of view (FOV) for each PD is given analytically. The impact of random device orientation and diffuse link signal propagation are taken into consideration. The performances of PRs and TPRs are compared and then optimized ADR structures are proposed. The performance comparison between the select best combining (SBC) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) is given under different noise levels. It is shown that SBC will outperform MRC in an interference limited system, otherwise, MRC is a preferred scheme. In addition, the double source system, where each LiFi AP consists of two sources transmitting the same information signals but with opposite polarity, is proved to outperform the single source (SS) system under certain conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a method for simulating quantum systems using electrical networks. Our approach leverages a generalized similarity transformation, which connects different Hamiltonians, enabling well-defined paths for quantum system simulation using classical circuits. By synthesizing interaction networks, we accurately simulate quantum systems of varying complexity, from $2-$state to $n-$state systems. Unlike quantum computers, classical approaches do not require stringent conditions, making them more accessible for practical implementation. Our reinterpretation of Born's rule in the context of electrical circuit simulations offers a perspective on quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the detection of the presence of malicious components in cyber-physical systems in the almost sure sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies a fundamental problem of security of cyber-physical systems (CPSs): that of detecting, almost surely, the presence of malicious components in the CPS. We assume that some of the actuators may be malicious while all sensors are honest. We introduce a novel idea of separability of state trajectories generated by CPSs in two situations: those under the nominal no-attack situation and those under the influence of an attacker. We establish its connection to security of CPSs in the context of detecting the presence of malicious actuators (if any) in them. As primary contributions we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the aforementioned detection in CPSs modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Moreover, we focus on the mechanism of perturbing the pre-determined control policies of the honest agents in CPSs modeled as stochastic linear systems, by injecting a certain class of random process called private excitation; sufficient conditions for detectability and non-detectability of the presence of malicious actuators assuming that the policies are randomized history dependent and randomized Markovian, are established. Several technical aspects of our results are discussed extensively.</description>

      <title>Structural Controllability of Drift-free Bilinear Systems on $\mathbb{SE(n)}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain graph theoretic necessary and sufficient conditions for the structural controllability of drift free bilinear systems on the special Euclidean group leveraging results from the existing literature.
  The graph theoretic conditions allow us to check the structural controllability in polynomial time.
  We use these conditions to find the sparsest structures for structural controllability.
  These conditions can also be used to check the structural accessibility of bilinear systems with drift.
  Equivalent conditions using the permutation group are also obtained.
  We consider the problem of link failures within a given structure and obtain equivalent conditions for structural controllability which are polynomial time checkable.
  We show that the problem of finding sparsest structures under $k$ link failures is NP-hard for $k&gt;0$.
  We also discuss the case of structural controllability under probabilistic link failures.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Neural ODE Networks on Lie Groups For Robot Dynamics Learning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate models of robot dynamics are critical for safe and stable control and generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models, however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning. This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of many robots are described in terms of their generalized coordinates on a matrix Lie group, e.g. on $SE(3)$ for ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation of energy principles. This paper proposes a port-Hamiltonian formulation over a Lie group of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) network to approximate the robot dynamics. In contrast to a black-box ODE network, our formulation embeds energy conservation principle and Lie group's constraints in the dynamics model and explicitly accounts for energy-dissipation effect such as friction and drag forces in the dynamics model. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the learned, potentially under-actuated Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a unified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various robot platforms.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model order reduction of large-scale dynamical systems with root mean squared error measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Coordination in Noncooperative Multiplayer Matrix Games via Reduced Rank Correlated Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordination in multiplayer games enables players to avoid the lose-lose outcome that often arises at Nash equilibria. However, designing a coordination mechanism typically requires the consideration of the joint actions of all players, which becomes intractable in large-scale games. We develop a novel coordination mechanism, termed reduced rank correlated equilibria, which reduces the number of joint actions to be considered and thereby mitigates computational complexity. The idea is to approximate the set of all joint actions with the actions used in a set of pre-computed Nash equilibria via a convex hull operation. In a game with n players and each player having m actions, the proposed mechanism reduces the number of joint actions considered from O(m^n) to O(mn). We demonstrate the application of the proposed mechanism to an air traffic queue management problem. Compared with the correlated equilibrium-a popular benchmark coordination mechanism-the proposed approach is capable of solving a problem involving four thousand times more joint actions while yielding similar or better performance in terms of a fairness indicator and showing a maximum optimality gap of 0.066% in terms of the average delay cost. In the meantime, it yields a solution that shows up to 99.5% improvement in a fairness indicator and up to 50.4% reduction in average delay cost compared to the Nash solution, which does not involve coordination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High performance computing data is surging fast into the exabyte-scale world, where tape libraries are the main platform for long-term durable data storage besides high-cost DNA. Tape libraries are extremely hard to model, but accurate modeling is critical for system administrators to obtain valid performance estimates for their designs. This research introduces a discrete--event tape simulation platform that realistically models tape library behavior in a networked cloud environment, by incorporating real-world phenomena and effects. The platform addresses several challenges, including precise estimation of data access latency, rates of robot exchange, data collocation, deduplication/compression ratio, and attainment of durability goals through replication or erasure coding. Using the {proposed} simulator, {one can} compare the single enterprise configuration with multiple commodity library configurations, making it a useful tool for system administrators and reliability engineers. This makes the simulator a valuable tool for system administrators and reliability engineers, enabling them to acquire practical and dependable performance estimates for their enduring, cost-efficient cold data storage architecture designs.</description>

      <title>Assistance-Seeking in Human-Supervised Autonomy: Role of Trust and Secondary Task Engagement (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a dual-task paradigm, we explore how robot actions, performance, and the introduction of a secondary task influence human trust and engagement. In our study, a human supervisor simultaneously engages in a target-tracking task while supervising a mobile manipulator performing an object collection task. The robot can either autonomously collect the object or ask for human assistance. The human supervisor also has the choice to rely upon or interrupt the robot. Using data from initial experiments, we model the dynamics of human trust and engagement using a linear dynamical system (LDS). Furthermore, we develop a human action model to define the probability of human reliance on the robot. Our model suggests that participants are more likely to interrupt the robot when their trust and engagement are low during high-complexity collection tasks. Using Model Predictive Control (MPC), we design an optimal assistance-seeking policy. Evaluation experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the MPC policy over the baseline policy for most participants.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models with Representation Editing: A Control Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human objectives is crucial for real-world applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs for alignment often suffers from unstable training and requires substantial computing resources. Test-time alignment techniques, such as prompting and guided decoding, do not modify the underlying model, and their performance remains dependent on the original model's capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose aligning LLMs through representation editing. The core of our method is to view a pre-trained autoregressive LLM as a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system. To achieve alignment for specific objectives, we introduce external control signals into the state space of this language dynamical system. We train a value function directly on the hidden states according to the Bellman equation, enabling gradient-based optimization to obtain the optimal control signals at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing test-time alignment techniques while requiring significantly fewer resources compared to fine-tuning methods.</description>
