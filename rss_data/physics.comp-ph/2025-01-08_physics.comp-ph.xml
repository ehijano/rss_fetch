      <title>Precision Evaluation Criteria for Simulation Algorithms in Infinite Systems: A Network Model-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the particle count escalates, the computational demands of diverse simulation algorithms surge, paralleled by a marked enhancement in accuracy. The question arises whether this heightened precision asymptotically dwindles towards zero or plateaus at a finite constant. To address this, this work introduces an approach that translates infinite systems into finite-node network architectures, providing a rigorous framework for assessing this question. Employing the Monte Carlo algorithm's application to the Ising model as a case study, this paper demonstrate that despite the simulation's extension to an infinite lattice size, a fundamental error bound persists. This work explicitly derive this lower bound on the error, offering a quantitative understanding of the algorithm's limitations in the limit of infinite scale. Furthermore, I extend this methodology to Molecular Dynamics simulations, exemplified through its application to battery systems. This conversion strategy not only underscores the generality of this approach but also highlights its practical significance in guiding the optimization of simulation algorithms. Moreover, it offers insights into estimating micro-level information from macro-level data. The crucial information of Molecular Simulation, namely the potential energy, has been quickly estimated.</description>

      <title>The Artificial Scientist -- in-transit Machine Learning of Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing HPC cluster sizes and large-scale simulations that produce petabytes of data per run, create massive IO and storage challenges for analysis. Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and scaling to Frontier exascale system.</description>

      <title>Simulation on the Miniaturization and Performance Improvement Study of Gr/MoS2 Based Vertical Field Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical field effect transistors (VFETs) show many advantages such as high switching speed, low operating voltage, low power consumption, and miniaturization over lateral FETs. However, VFET still faces the main challenges of high off-state current. Graphene (Gr) and transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive materials for the next generation electronics. In this simulation work, the bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is sandwiched between perforated monolayer Gr which acts as the source electrode, and aluminum (Al) as the top drain electrode. In addition to this, the minimization of the off-state current is carried out by modifications in the source contact geometry by insulating some part of the source electrode and introducing the extra MoS2 layer between the source and gate dielectric named as buried layer. After the modification, the results show an improvement in OFF current, hence the ON/OFF ratio. The highest ON/OFF ratio of 109 is achieved with top side insulated source contact and thinnest buried layer of 02 nm with top and sidewall insulation. These results would support low voltage operation with high switching speed in complete 2D material based VFETs and further miniaturize its geometry.</description>

      <title>Investigation of coalescence and pinch-off processes of a self-rewetting drop interacting with a liquid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-rewetting fluids (SRFs), such as long-chain aqueous alcohols, are a special class of liquids with surface tension that is anomalously dependent quadratically on temperature, resulting in thermocapillary flows that differ significantly from those in normal fluids (NFs). This study focuses on investigating the behavior of SRF drops interacting with a liquid layer under nonuniform heating conditions. In this regard, we employ a robust central moment-based lattice Boltzmann method with a phase-field model expressed in an axisymmetric formulation to capture three-dimensional effects efficiently. We investigate the coalescence and pinch-off processes in SRFs and compare them to those in NFs. Our simulations reveal that SRFs undergo pinch-off earlier than NFs. We also observe that increasing the Ohnesorge number Oh suppresses the pinch-off process, highlighting the relative role of viscous forces, which is modulated by gravity effects or the Bond number Bo. Furthermore, we explore how varying the dimensionless linear and quadratic sensitivity coefficients of surface tension on temperature, M1 and M2, respectively, and the dimensionless heat flux Q influence the coalescence/pinch-off behavior. Interestingly, contrary to the behavior in NFs, in SRFs increasing M2, or Q reduces the time required to pinch-off and widens the region in the Oh-Bo regime map where pinch-off occurs, when compared to the unheated cases. These differences are shown to be due to the variations in the thermocapillary forces on the interface. Overall, we find that under nonuniform heating, the SRFs enhance the pinch-off process compared to NFs across a wider range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Activity-Driven Dynamics of Semiflexible Polymers in Motility Assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of semiflexible polymers in a motility assay, where motor proteins (MPs) stochastically bind, unbind, and walk along the polymer, under the influence of harmonic confinement. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we explore the interplay between the polymer's rigidity, activity in the form of attachment/detachment of MPs and subsequent movement of attached MPs, and trap strength, revealing a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region. Rigidity significantly impacts the trapping behaviour, with flexible polymers remaining trapped at the higher activity. Attachment/detachment of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap.The polymer undergoes spiral and open-chain conformations, with the turning number serving as a key order parameter to quantify spiral formation. We show that confinement stabilizes spiral structures and suppresses open-chain motion, especially at higher activity. The centre of mass (COM) dynamics are analyzed through the mean square displacement (MSD), showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Negative excess kurtosis indicates nonequilibrium behaviour, which saturates with increasing confinement, reflecting the dominance of the trap over the activity.</description>

      <title>Modelling anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation with the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation is often used to model the formation of faceted pyramids on nanoscale crystal surfaces. In comparison to the isotropic Cahn-Hilliard model, the nonlinear terms associated with strong anisotropic coefficients present challenges for developing an effective numerical scheme. In this work, we propose a multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method to solve the anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation. To this end, we reformulate the original equation into a nonlinear convection-diffusion equation with source terms. Then the modified equilibrium distribution function and source terms are incorporated into the computations. Through Chapman-Enskog analysis, it successfully recovers the macroscopic governing equation. To validate the proposed approach, we perform numerical simulations, including cases like droplet deformation and spinodal decomposition. These results consistent with available works, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that the model adheres to the energy dissipation law, further highlighting the effectiveness of the developed lattice Boltzmann method.</description>

      <title>Iterative Volume-of-Fluid interface positioning in general polyhedrons with Consecutive Cubic Spline interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A straightforward and computationally efficient Consecutive Cubic Spline (CCS) iterative algorithm is proposed for positioning the planar interface of the unstructured geometrical Volume-of-Fluid method in arbitrarily-shaped cells. The CCS algorithm is a two-point root-finding algorithm specifically designed for the VOF interface positioning problem, where the volume fraction function has diminishing derivatives at the ends of the search interval. As a two-point iterative algorithm, CCS re-uses function values and derivatives from previous iterations and does not rely on interval bracketing. The CCS algorithm only requires only two iterations on average to position the interface with a tolerance of $10^{-12}$, even with numerically very challenging volume fraction values, e.g. near $10^{-9}$ or $1-10^{-9}$.
  The proposed CCS algorithm is very straightforward to implement because its input is already calculated by every geometrical VOF method. It builds upon and significantly improves the predictive Newton method and is independent of the cell's geometrical model and related intersection algorithm. Geometrical parametrizations of truncated volumes used by other contemporary methods are completely avoided. The computational efficiency is comparable in terms of the number of iterations to the fastest methods reported so far. References are provided in the results section to the open-source implementation of the CCS algorithm and the performance measurement data.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies in Unstructured Geometric Volume-of-Fluid Methods for Two-Phase Flows with High Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric flux-based Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) methods are widely considered consistent in handling two-phase flows with high density ratios. However, although the conservation of mass and momentum is consistent for two-phase incompressible single-field Navier-Stokes equations without phase-change, discretization may easily introduce small inconsistencies that result in very large errors or catastrophic failure. We apply the consistency conditions derived for the unstructured Level Set / Front Tracking method to flux-based geometric VOF methods, and implement our discretization into the plicRDF-isoAdvector geometrical VOF method. We find that computing the mass flux by scaling the geometrically computed fluxed phase-specific volume destroys the equivalence between the scaled volume fraction equation and the mass conservation equation, depending on the choice for the temporal and convective term discretization schemes. We propose two solutions. First, based on the analysis of discretization errors, we suggest a consistent combination of the temporal discretization scheme and the interpolation scheme for the momentum convection term. Second, similar to our previous work on the unstructured Level Set / Front Tracking method, we solve an auxiliary mass conservation equation with a geometrical calculation of the face-centered density. We prove the equivalence between these two approaches mathematically and verify and validate their numerical stability for density ratios in the range $[1,10^6]$ and viscosity ratios in the range $[10^2,10^5]$.</description>

      <title>An unstructured geometrical un-split VOF method for viscoelastic two-phase flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since viscoelastic two-phase flows arise in various industrial and natural processes, developing accurate and efficient software for their detailed numerical simulation is a highly relevant and challenging research task. We present a geometrical unstructured Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method for handling two-phase flows with viscoelastic liquid phase, where the latter is modeled via generic rate-type constitutive equations and a one-field description is derived by conditional volume averaging of the local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The method builds on the plicRDF-isoAdvector geometrical VOF solver that is extended and combined with the modular framework DeboRheo for viscoelastic computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A piecewise-linear geometrical interface reconstruction technique on general unstructured meshes is employed for discretizing the viscoelastic stresses across the fluid interface. DeboRheo facilitates a flexible combination of different rheological models with appropriate stabilization methods to address the high Weissenberg number problem.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

Abstract: A new solver, named FLiMESolve, is exhibited which is well suited for time-periodic (Floquet-type) Hamiltonians. This solver maintains the benefits of other solvers presently considered, while superceding their usefulness within its own regime. FLiMESolve is able to efficiently and accurately simulate time-periodic systems while being faster and more accurate than other solvers and with the ability to relax the secular approximation inherent to the Lindblad Equation.</description>

Abstract: III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing creep resistance in refractory high-entropy alloys: role of grain size and local chemical order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>
