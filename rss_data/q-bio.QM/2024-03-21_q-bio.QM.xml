      <title>From primary HPV infection to carcinoma in situ: a mathematical approach of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the development of abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix, caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Although in most of the cases it is resolved by the immune system, a small percentage of people might develop a more serious CIN which, if left untreated, can develop into cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally, for which the World Health Organization (WHO) recently adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination by 2030. With this research topic being more imperative than ever, in this paper, we develop a nonlinear mathematical model describing the CIN progression. The model consists of partial differential equations describing the dynamics of epithelial, dysplastic and immune cells, as well as the dynamics of viral particles. We use our model to explore numerically three important factors of dysplasia progression, namely the geometry of the cervix, the strength of the immune response and the frequency of viral exposure.</description>

      <title>Nellie: Automated organelle segmentation, tracking, and hierarchical feature extraction in 2D/3D live-cell microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of dynamic organelles remains a formidable challenge, though key to understanding biological processes. We introduce Nellie, an automated and unbiased pipeline for segmentation, tracking, and feature extraction of diverse intracellular structures. Nellie adapts to image metadata, eliminating user input. Nellie's preprocessing pipeline enhances structural contrast on multiple intracellular scales allowing for robust hierarchical segmentation of sub-organellar regions. Internal motion capture markers are generated and tracked via a radius-adaptive pattern matching scheme, and used as guides for sub-voxel flow interpolation. Nellie extracts a plethora of features at multiple hierarchical levels for deep and customizable analysis. Nellie features a Napari-based GUI that allows for code-free operation and visualization, while its modular open-source codebase invites customization by experienced users. We demonstrate Nellie's wide variety of use cases with two examples: unmixing multiple organelles from a single channel using feature-based classification and training an unsupervised graph autoencoder on mitochondrial multi-mesh graphs to quantify latent space embedding changes following ionomycin treatment.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Computational Intelligence Approach to Personalised Health and Immune Age Characterisation from Common Haematological Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01444v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simulated digital model that learns a person's optimal blood health over time. Using a learning adaptive algorithm, our model provides a risk assessment score that compares an individual's chronological age from birth to an estimation of a biological immune age derived from the score. We demonstrate its efficacy against real and synthetic data from medically relevant cases, extreme cases, and empirical blood cell count data from 100K data records in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (CDC NHANES) that spans 13 years. We find that the score is informative when distinguishing healthy individuals from those with diseases, both self-reported and abnormal blood tests manifested, providing an entry-level score for patient triaging. We show that, by analyzing an individual's Full Blood Count (FBC) or Complete Blood Count (CBC), test results over time allows us to calculate an immune age score that correlates with chronological age. The immune age score, derived solely from popular hematological markers, can be widely used to serve purposes of precise healthcare, and predictive medicine.</description>
