      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Soliton dynamics in the ABS nonlinear spinor model with external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the novel nonlinear model in (1 + 1)-dimensions for Dirac spinors recently introduced by Alexeeva, Barashenkov, and Saxena [1] (ABS model), which admits an exact explicit solitary-wave (soliton for short) solution. The charge, the momentum, and the energy of this solution are conserved. We investigate the dynamics of the soliton subjected to several potentials: a ramp, a harmonic, and a periodic potential. We develop a Collective Coordinates Theory by making an ansatz for a moving soliton where the position, rapidity, and momentum, are functions of time. We insert the ansatz into the Lagrangian density of the model, integrate over space and obtain a Lagrangian as a function of the collective coordinates. This Lagrangian differs only in the charge and mass with the Lagrangian of a collective coordinates theory for the Gross-Neveu equation. Thus the soliton dynamics in the ABS spinor model is qualitatively the same as in the Gross-Neveu equation, but quantitatively it differs. These results of the collective coordinates theory are confirmed by simulations, i.e., by numerical solutions for solitons of the ABS spinor model, subjected to the above potentials.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tongue Frequency Fractal Dynamics in Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons Induced by Temporal Interference Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate neuronal excitability in the Hodgkin-Huxley model under temporal interference (TI) stimulation in a previously unexplored sub-Hz resonant regime and uncover a striking nonlinear response that we term 'multi-tongue frequency fractals'. Unlike single-frequency driving, which yields a smooth resonant valley, dual-frequency excitation fragments this response into a hierarchy of sharply modulated tongues whose number and structure grow with observation time, revealing clear self-similar architecture. These features emerge from transitions between non-cascaded and cascaded high-harmonic and sub-harmonic generation as detuning varies, and are maximized near the intrinsic ionic timescale at omega ~ 0.2 rad/s. Parameter sweeps show that the fractal count is higher for higher potassium conductances, lower sodium conductances and lower leak conductances. These results demonstrate that TI stimulation can elicit rich, hierarchically organized frequency responses even in classical excitable membranes, revealing fractal organization in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Thermalization in A Nonlinear Variant of the Discrete NLS Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermalization properties of a fully nonlinear lattice model originally derived from the two-dimensional cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) using analytical and numerical methods. Our analysis reveals both ergodic and nonergodic regimes; importantly, we find broad parameter ranges where the dynamics is ergodic even though it lies outside the Gibbsian parameter regime (for both $D=0.25$ and $D=2$), and a higher-energy range where ergodicity breaks down. We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization. We examine the influence of the nonlinear dispersion parameter $D$ on the system's behavior, showing that increasing $D$ enhances fluctuations and speeds up the crossover of $q(T)$ toward the $\sim 1/T$ scaling. By analyzing excursion times, probability density functions, and localization patterns, we characterize transitions between ergodic and nonergodic behavior. In long-time numerical simulations within the non-ergodic regime for $D&gt;1$, stable localization over two sites is observed, while $D&lt;1$ favors single-site localization in the high energy density regimes. Our results provide insights into the interplay between thermalization, localization, and non-standard statistical behavior in genuinely nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous quantized nonlinear Thouless pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle differs from the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton comes. We develop a general theory showing that this anomalous behavior arises from a transition of a soliton between different Wannier functions by passing through an intersite-soliton (or dipole-soliton) state. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump of a soliton, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>Spot solutions to a neural field equation on oblate spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos in relativistic degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the nonlinear interactions of high-frequency circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves and low-frequency electron-acoustic (EA) density perturbations driven by the EM wave ponderomotive force in relativistic plasmas {(moderate, strong, and ultra-relativistic)} with two groups of electrons--the population of relativistic degenerate dense electrons (bulk plasma) and the sparse relativistic nondegenerate (classical) electrons, and immobile singly charged positive ions. By pattern selection, we show that many solitary patterns can be generated and drenched through modulational instability of EM waves at different spatial length scales and that the EM wave radiation spectra emanating from compact astrophysical objects may not settle into stable envelope solitons but into different incoherent states, including the emergence of temporal and spatiotemporal chaos due to collisions and fusions among the patterns with strong EA wave emission. The appearance of these states is confirmed by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent spectra, correlation function, and mutual information {as quantitative evidence}. As a result, the redistribution of wave energy from initially exciting many solitary patterns at large scales to a few new incoherent patterns with small wavelengths in the system occurs, leading to the onset of turbulence in astrophysical plasmas.</description>
