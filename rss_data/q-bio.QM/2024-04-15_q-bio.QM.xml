      <title>Drug Repurposing for Parkinson's Disease Using Random Walk With Restart Algorithm and the Parkinson's Disease Ontology Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a progressive and slowly developing neurodegenerative disease, characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra region of the brain. Despite extensive research by scientists, there is not yet a cure to this problem and the available therapies mainly help to reduce some of the Parkinson's symptoms. Drug repurposing (that is, the process of finding new uses for existing drugs) receives more appraisals as an efficient way that allows for reducing the time, resources, and risks associated with the development of new drugs. In this research, we design a novel computational platform that integrates gene expression data, biological networks, and the PDOD database to identify possible drug-repositioning agents for PD therapy. By using machine learning approaches like the RWR algorithm and PDOD scoring system we arrange drug-disease conversions and sort our potential sandboxes according to their possible efficacy. We propose gene expression analysis, network prioritization, and drug target data analysis to arrive at a comprehensive evaluation of drug repurposing chances. Our study results highlight such therapies as promising drug candidates to conduct further research on PD treatment. We also provide the rationale for promising drug repurposing ideas by using various sources of data and computational approaches.</description>

      <title>VADA: a Data-Driven Simulator for Nanopore Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing offers the ability for real-time analysis of long DNA sequences at a low cost, enabling new applications such as early detection of cancer. Due to the complex nature of nanopore measurements and the high cost of obtaining ground truth datasets, there is a need for nanopore simulators. Existing simulators rely on handcrafted rules and parameters and do not learn an internal representation that would allow for analysing underlying biological factors of interest. Instead, we propose VADA, a purely data-driven method for simulating nanopores based on an autoregressive latent variable model. We embed subsequences of DNA and introduce a conditional prior to address the challenge of a collapsing conditioning. We introduce an auxiliary regressor on the latent variable to encourage our model to learn an informative latent representation. We empirically demonstrate that our model achieves competitive simulation performance on experimental nanopore data. Moreover, we show we have learned an informative latent representation that is predictive of the DNA labels. We hypothesize that other biological factors of interest, beyond the DNA labels, can potentially be extracted from such a learned latent representation.</description>

      <title>Survival Prediction Across Diverse Cancer Types Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gastric cancer and Colon adenocarcinoma represent widespread and challenging malignancies with high mortality rates and complex treatment landscapes. In response to the critical need for accurate prognosis in cancer patients, the medical community has embraced the 5-year survival rate as a vital metric for estimating patient outcomes. This study introduces a pioneering approach to enhance survival prediction models for gastric and Colon adenocarcinoma patients. Leveraging advanced image analysis techniques, we sliced whole slide images (WSI) of these cancers, extracting comprehensive features to capture nuanced tumor characteristics. Subsequently, we constructed patient-level graphs, encapsulating intricate spatial relationships within tumor tissues. These graphs served as inputs for a sophisticated 4-layer graph convolutional neural network (GCN), designed to exploit the inherent connectivity of the data for comprehensive analysis and prediction. By integrating patients' total survival time and survival status, we computed C-index values for gastric cancer and Colon adenocarcinoma, yielding 0.57 and 0.64, respectively. Significantly surpassing previous convolutional neural network models, these results underscore the efficacy of our approach in accurately predicting patient survival outcomes. This research holds profound implications for both the medical and AI communities, offering insights into cancer biology and progression while advancing personalized treatment strategies. Ultimately, our study represents a significant stride in leveraging AI-driven methodologies to revolutionize cancer prognosis and improve patient outcomes on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Prevalence estimation methods for time-dependent antibody kinetics of infected and vaccinated individuals: a graph-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immune events such as infection, vaccination, and a combination of the two result in distinct time-dependent antibody responses in affected individuals. These responses and event prevalences combine non-trivially to govern antibody levels sampled from a population. Time-dependence and disease prevalence pose considerable modeling challenges that need to be addressed to provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning of the underlying biology. We propose a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for anti-body kinetics and demonstrate its use in a setting in which individuals can be infected or vaccinated but not both. We prove the equivalency of this approach to the framework developed in our previous work. Synthetic data are used to demonstrate the modeling process and conduct prevalence estimation via transition probability matrices. This approach is ideal to model sequences of infections and vaccinations, or personal trajectories in a population, making it an important first step towards a mathematical characterization of reinfection, vaccination boosting, and cross-events of infection after vaccination or vice versa.</description>

      <title>A Self-feedback Knowledge Elicitation Approach for Chemical Reaction Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of chemical reaction predictions (CRPs) plays a pivotal role in advancing drug discovery and material science. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the vast and uncertain chemical reaction space and challenges in capturing reaction selectivity, particularly due to existing methods' limitations in exploiting the data's inherent knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-curated self-feedback knowledge elicitation approach. This method starts from iterative optimization of molecular representations and facilitates the extraction of knowledge on chemical reaction types (RTs). Then, we employ adaptive prompt learning to infuse the prior knowledge into the large language model (LLM). As a result, we achieve significant enhancements: a 14.2% increase in retrosynthesis prediction accuracy, a 74.2% rise in reagent prediction accuracy, and an expansion in the model's capability for handling multi-task chemical reactions. This research offers a novel paradigm for knowledge elicitation in scientific research and showcases the untapped potential of LLMs in CRPs.</description>

      <title>Deformable MRI Sequence Registration for AI-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PI-CAI (Prostate Imaging: Cancer AI) challenge led to expert-level diagnostic algorithms for clinically significant prostate cancer detection. The algorithms receive biparametric MRI scans as input, which consist of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted scans. These scans can be misaligned due to multiple factors in the scanning process. Image registration can alleviate this issue by predicting the deformation between the sequences. We investigate the effect of image registration on the diagnostic performance of AI-based prostate cancer diagnosis. First, the image registration algorithm, developed in MeVisLab, is analyzed using a dataset with paired lesion annotations. Second, the effect on diagnosis is evaluated by comparing case-level cancer diagnosis performance between using the original dataset, rigidly aligned diffusion-weighted scans, or deformably aligned diffusion-weighted scans. Rigid registration showed no improvement. Deformable registration demonstrated a substantial improvement in lesion overlap (+10% median Dice score) and a positive yet non-significant improvement in diagnostic performance (+0.3% AUROC, p=0.18). Our investigation shows that a substantial improvement in lesion alignment does not directly lead to a significant improvement in diagnostic performance. Qualitative analysis indicated that jointly developing image registration methods and diagnostic AI algorithms could enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>AMPCliff: quantitative definition and benchmarking of activity cliffs in antimicrobial peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activity cliff (AC) is a phenomenon that a pair of similar molecules differ by a small structural alternation but exhibit a large difference in their biochemical activities. The AC of small molecules has been extensively investigated but limited knowledge is accumulated about the AC phenomenon in peptides with canonical amino acids. This study introduces a quantitative definition and benchmarking framework AMPCliff for the AC phenomenon in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) composed by canonical amino acids. A comprehensive analysis of the existing AMP dataset reveals a significant prevalence of AC within AMPs. AMPCliff quantifies the activities of AMPs by the metric minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and defines 0.9 as the minimum threshold for the normalized BLOSUM62 similarity score between a pair of aligned peptides with at least two-fold MIC changes. This study establishes a benchmark dataset of paired AMPs in Staphylococcus aureus from the publicly available AMP dataset GRAMPA, and conducts a rigorous procedure to evaluate various AMP AC prediction models, including nine machine learning, four deep learning algorithms, four masked language models, and four generative language models. Our analysis reveals that these models are capable of detecting AMP AC events and the pre-trained protein language ESM2 model demonstrates superior performance across the evaluations. The predictive performance of AMP activity cliffs remains to be further improved, considering that ESM2 with 33 layers only achieves the Spearman correlation coefficient=0.50 for the regression task of the MIC values on the benchmark dataset.

      <description>arXiv:2403.14481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarity analyses between multiple correlation or covariance tables constitute the cornerstone of network neuroscience. Here, we introduce covSTATIS, a versatile, linear, unsupervised multi-table method designed to identify structured patterns in multi-table data, and allow for the simultaneous extraction and interpretation of both individual and group-level features. With covSTATIS, multiple similarity tables can now be easily integrated, without requiring a priori data simplification, complex black-box implementations, user-dependent specifications, or supervised frameworks. Applications of covSTATIS, a tutorial with Open Data and source code are provided. CovSTATIS offers a promising avenue for advancing the theoretical and analytic landscape of network neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Using Instruments for Selection to Adjust for Selection Bias in Mendelian Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selection bias is a common concern in epidemiologic studies. In the literature, selection bias is often viewed as a missing data problem. Popular approaches to adjust for bias due to missing data, such as inverse probability weighting, rely on the assumption that data are missing at random and can yield biased results if this assumption is violated. In observational studies with outcome data missing not at random, Heckman's sample selection model can be used to adjust for bias due to missing data. In this paper, we review Heckman's method and a similar approach proposed by Tchetgen Tchetgen and Wirth (2017). We then discuss how to apply these methods to Mendelian randomization analyses using individual-level data, with missing data for either the exposure or outcome or both. We explore whether genetic variants associated with participation can be used as instruments for selection. We then describe how to obtain missingness-adjusted Wald ratio, two-stage least squares and inverse variance weighted estimates. The two methods are evaluated and compared in simulations, with results suggesting that they can both mitigate selection bias but may yield parameter estimates with large standard errors in some settings. In an illustrative real-data application, we investigate the effects of body mass index on smoking using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.</description>

      <title>Modeling Dense Multimodal Interactions Between Biological Pathways and Histology for Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating whole-slide images (WSIs) and bulk transcriptomics for predicting patient survival can improve our understanding of patient prognosis. However, this multimodal task is particularly challenging due to the different nature of these data: WSIs represent a very high-dimensional spatial description of a tumor, while bulk transcriptomics represent a global description of gene expression levels within that tumor. In this context, our work aims to address two key challenges: (1) how can we tokenize transcriptomics in a semantically meaningful and interpretable way?, and (2) how can we capture dense multimodal interactions between these two modalities? Specifically, we propose to learn biological pathway tokens from transcriptomics that can encode specific cellular functions. Together with histology patch tokens that encode the different morphological patterns in the WSI, we argue that they form appropriate reasoning units for downstream interpretability analyses. We propose fusing both modalities using a memory-efficient multimodal Transformer that can model interactions between pathway and histology patch tokens. Our proposed model, SURVPATH, achieves state-of-the-art performance when evaluated against both unimodal and multimodal baselines on five datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our interpretability framework identifies key multimodal prognostic factors, and, as such, can provide valuable insights into the interaction between genotype and phenotype, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms at play. We make our code public at: https://github.com/ajv012/SurvPath.</description>

      <title>Individualizing Glioma Radiotherapy Planning by Optimization of Data and Physics-Informed Discrete Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor growth is unique to each glioma patient and extends beyond what is visible in imaging scans, infiltrating surrounding brain tissue. Understanding these hidden patient-specific progressions is essential for effective therapies. Current treatment plans for brain tumors, such as radiotherapy, typically involve delineating a uniform margin around the visible tumor on pre-treatment scans to target this invisible tumor growth. This "one size fits all" approach is derived from population studies and often fails to account for the nuances of individual patient conditions. We present the GliODIL framework, which infers the full spatial distribution of tumor cell concentration from available multi-modal imaging, leveraging a Fisher-Kolmogorov type physics model to describe tumor growth. This is achieved through the newly introduced method of Optimizing the Discrete Loss (ODIL), where both data and physics-based constraints are softly assimilated into the solution. Our test dataset comprises 152 glioblastoma patients with pre-treatment imaging and post-treatment follow-ups for tumor recurrence monitoring. By blending data-driven techniques with physics-based constraints, GliODIL enhances recurrence prediction in radiotherapy planning, challenging traditional uniform margins and strict adherence to the Fisher-Kolmogorov partial differential equation (PDE) model, which is adapted for complex cases.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Deep Learning Classification from Raw Signal Data in Radiology, Ultrasonography and Electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging is a very useful tool in healthcare, various technologies being employed to non-invasively peek inside the human body. Deep learning with neural networks in radiology was welcome - albeit cautiously - by the radiologist community. Most of the currently deployed or researched deep learning solutions are applied on already generated images of medical scans, use the neural networks to aid in the generation of such images, or use them for identifying specific substance markers in spectrographs. This paper's author posits that if the neural networks were trained directly on the raw signals from the scanning machines, they would gain access to more nuanced information than from the already processed images, hence the training - and later, the inferences - would become more accurate. The paper presents the main current applications of deep learning in radiography, ultrasonography, and electrophysiology, and discusses whether the proposed neural network training directly on raw signals is feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this mini-review, we explore the new prediction methods for drug combination synergy relying on high-throughput combinatorial screens. The fast progress of the field is witnessed in the more than thirty original machine learning methods published since 2021, a clear majority of them based on deep learning techniques. We aim to put these papers under a unifying lens by highlighting the core technologies, the data sources, the input data types and synergy scores used in the methods, as well as the prediction scenarios and evaluation protocols that the papers deal with. Our finding is that the best methods accurately solve the synergy prediction scenarios involving known drugs or cell lines while the scenarios involving new drugs or cell lines still fall short of an accurate prediction level.</description>
