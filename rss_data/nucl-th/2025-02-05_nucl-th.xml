      <title>Emission processes in a self-consistent field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic description of cluster emission processes within the Cluster--Hartree--Fock (CHF) self--consistent field (SCF) theory. The starting point is a Woods--Saxon (WS) mean field (MF) with spin--orbit and Coulomb terms. Pairing is treated through standard Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) quasiparticles. The residual two--body interaction is given by a density--dependent Wigner force having a Gaussian shape with a center of mass (com) correction located in a region of low nuclear density slightly beyond the geometrical contact radius of a system comprised from a nucleus and a surface cluster. We show that such a description adequately reproduces the ground state (gs) shape of a spherical nucleus while the surface correction enhances the radial tail of single particle orbitals, thus allowing for an adequate description of the $\alpha$-decay width for unstable systems.</description>

      <title>Absorption of $\psi(2S)$ mesons in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the inclusive $\psi(2S)$ meson photoproduction from nuclei near the kinematic threshold within the collision model, based on the nuclear spectral function, for incoherent direct photon--nucleon charmonium creation processes. The model takes into account the final $\psi(2S)$ absorption, target nucleon binding and Fermi motion. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $\psi(2S)$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 8.0--16.4 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$, the momentum dependence of the ratio of these cross sections as well as the A-dependences of the ratios (transparency ratios) of the total cross cross sections for $\psi(2S)$ production at photon energy of 13 GeV within the different scenarios for the $\psi(2S)N$ absorption cross section. We also calculate the A-dependence of the ratio of $\psi(2S)$ and $J/\psi$ photoproduction transparency ratios at photon energies around of 11.5 GeV within the adopted scenarios for this cross section. We demonstrate that both the absolute and relative observables considered reveal a definite sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the upgraded up to 22 GeV CEBAF facility in the near-threshold energy region might shed light both on the $\psi(2S)N$ absorption cross section and on its part associated with the nondiagonal process $\psi(2S)+N \to J/\psi+N$ at finite momenta, which are of crucial importance in understanding of charmonium production and suppression in high-energy nucleus--nucleus collisions in a search for the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Induced Charged Current Coherent Pion Production for Constraining the Muon Neutrino Flux at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino induced charge current coherent pion production ($\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$) as a tool for constraining the neutrino flux at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The neutrino energy and flavor in the process can be directly reconstructed from the outgoing particles, making it especially useful to specifically constrain the muon neutrino component of the total flux. The cross section of this process can be obtained using the Adler relation with the $\pi$-Ar elastic scattering cross section, taken either from external data or, as we explore, from a simultaneous measurement in the DUNE near detector. We develop a procedure that leverages $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ events to fit for the neutrino flux while simultaneously accounting for relevant effects in the cross section. We project that this method has the statistical power to constrain the uncertainty on the normalization of the flux at its peak to a few percent. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ flux constraint, though further work will be needed to determine the range of validity and precision of the Adler relation upon which it relies, as well as to measure the $\pi$-Ar elastic scattering cross section to the requisite precision. We discuss the experimental and phenomenological developments necessary to unlock the $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ process as a "standard candle'' for neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-introduce, in light of our modern understanding of neutrinos, the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X\to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Frame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EoS constraints within a nonlocal color superconducting quark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 - 2.22~M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the fusion mechanism in heavy-ion collisions: A six-dimensional Langevin dissipative dynamics approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an in-depth investigation of heavy-ion fusion dynamics using a six-dimensional Langevin framework that enables unrestricted motion of the asymmetry parameter. The stochastic formalism naturally incorporates friction effects and energy fluctuations, providing a detailed understanding of the fusion process. The dynamics transition into the overdamped regime, facilitating rapid neck stabilization while effectively capturing the interplay between shape and rotational degrees of freedom. This approach achieves excellent agreement with experimental spin distributions and fusion cross-sections, establishing a robust foundation for forthcoming studies on the synthesis of superheavy elements and the exploration of the enigmatic fusion hindrance mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars in light of the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PREX-II experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent analysis on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant suggests interestingly small values for its mass and radius. Such an observation favors soft nuclear models that may be challenged by the observation of massive compact stars. In contrast, the recent PREX-II experiment, concerning the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb, points towards stiff equations of state that favor larger compact star radii. In the present study, we aim to explore the compatibility between stiff hadronic equations of state (favored by PREX-II) and the HESS J1731-347 remnant in the context of hybrid stars. For the construction of hybrid equations of state we use three widely employed Skyrme models combined with the well-known vector MIT bag model. Furthermore we consider two different scenarios concerning the energy density of the bag. In the first case, that of a constant bag parameter, we find that the resulting hybrid equations of state are strongly disfavored by the observation of $\sim2 M_\odot$ pulsars. However, the introduction of a Gaussian density dependence yields results that are compatible with the conservative $2 M_\odot$ constraint. The utilization of recent data based on the observation of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0952-0607 and GW190814 allows for the imposition of additional constraints on the relevant parameters and the stiffness of the two phases. Interestingly, we find that the derived hybrid equations of state do not satisfy the PSR J0030+0451 constraints in $1\sigma$ and only marginally agree with the $2\sigma$ estimations. In addition, we estimate that the observation of massive pulsars, like PSR J0952-0607, in combination with the existence of HESS J1731-347, may require a strong phase transition below $\sim 1.7n_0$. Finally, we show that the supermassive compact object involved in GW190814 could potentially be explained as a rapidly rotating hybrid star.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the (Z,A) Dependence of Coherent Muon-to-Electron Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Should muon-to-electron conversion in the field of a nucleus be found in the current generation of experiments, the measurement of the atomic number dependence of the process will become an important experimental goal. We present a new treatment of the (Z,A) dependence of coherent muon-to-electron conversion in 236 isotopes. Our approach differs from previous treatments in several ways. Firstly, we include the effect of permanent quadrupole deformation on the charged lepton flavor violating matrix elements, using the method of Barrett moments. This method also enables the addition of muonic X-ray nuclear size and shape determinations of the charge distribution to the electron scattering results used previously. Secondly, we employ a Hartree-Bogoliubov model to calculate neutron-related matrix elements for even-even nuclei. This takes into account the quadrupole deformation of the neutron distributions and the fact that neutrons are, in general, in different shell model orbits than protons. The calculated conversion rates differ from previous calculations, particularly in the region of large permanent quadrupole deformation. Finally, we propose an alternative normalization of the muon-to-electron conversion rated, which related more closely to what a given experiment acturally measures, and better separate lepton physics from nuclear physics effects.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>Comparison of renormalized interactions using one-dimensional few-body systems as a testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though the one-dimensional contact interaction requires no regularization, renormalization methods have been shown to improve the convergence of numerical ab initio calculations considerably. In this work, we compare and contrast these methods: `the running coupling constant' where the two-body ground state energy is used as a renormalization condition, and two effective interaction approaches that include information about the ground as well as excited states. In particular, we calculate the energies and densities of few-fermion systems in a harmonic oscillator with the configuration interaction method, and compare the results based upon renormalized and bare interactions. We find that the use of the running coupling constant instead of the bare interaction improves convergence significantly. A comparison with an effective interaction, which is designed to reproduce the relative part of the energy spectrum of two particles, showed a similar improvement. The effective interaction provides an additional improvement if the center-of-mass excitations are included in the construction. Finally, we discuss the transformation of observables alongside the renormalization of the potential, and demonstrate that this might be an essential ingredient for accurate numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound bounds and first-order phase transitions in compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we employ three distinct, physically motivated speed of sound bounds to construct hybrid models, where the high-density phase is described by the maximally stiff equation of state. In particular, we consider the bounds related to special relativity, relativistic kinetic theory and conformality. The low-density hadronic phase is described by a state-of-the-art microscopic relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. This work aims to access the effect of the different speed of sound constraints on the relevant parameter space of the key parameters of first-order phase transitions by utilizing recent astronomical data. This involves a systematic analysis that also includes two distinct schemes for the construction of hybrid models (abrupt and smooth). Finally, a relevant discussion is conducted on the possible occurrence of a thermodynamic inconsistency that is related to the stability of the high-density phase over hadronic matter at large densities.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Relaxation times for disoriented isospin condensates in high energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations between charged and neutral kaons measured by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC exceed conventional explanations. Previously it was shown that if the scalar condensate is accompanied by an electrically neutral isospin--1 field then the combination can produce large equilibrium fluctuations where $\langle \bar{u}u\rangle \ne \langle \bar{d}d\rangle$. Hadronizing strange and anti-strange quarks might then strongly fluctuate between charged ($u\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{u}$) and neutral ($d\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{d}$) kaons. Here we estimate the times for the condensates to achieve their equilibrium probability distributions within causal volumes in high energy heavy ion collisions. This is achieved by modeling the temperature dependence of the condensates, mesonic collective excitations, decay rates of the associated fields, and employing the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. Within this model, we find that the equilibration times are short compared with the expansion time, making disoriented isospin condensates a viable explanation for the anomalous fluctuations observed at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low $Q_\beta$ value for the allowed decay of $^{110}$Ag$^m$ confirmed via mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass of the electron-antineutrino can be determined in dedicated measurements of the $\beta$ spectral shape near the $\beta$ endpoint of a $\beta^-$ transition, with a low $Q$ value enhancing the sensitivity of the measurement. One such low-$Q$-value candidate is the transition between the $6^+$ isomer of $^{110}$Ag and the $5^+_2$ state in $^{110}$Cd ($Q^{\ast}_{\beta,m}=-0.12(131)$ keV). To reduce the uncertainty of the $Q$ value, we have used the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap and performed a high-precision atomic-mass measurement of $^{109}$Ag with $^{110}$Cd as a reference. Combined with the known spectroscopic data, we obtain a re-evaluated value $Q^{\ast}_{\beta,m}=405(135)$ eV, for the $^{110}\text{Ag}(6^+_\text{m}) \rightarrow {^{110}\text{Cd}}(5^+_2)$ transition. This represents the lowest $Q_{\beta}$ value for any allowed transition observed to date. In order to estimate the partial half-life ($t_{1/2}$) and branching ratio (Br) of the transition, nuclear shell-model calculations were performed using the $jj45pnb$ Hamiltonian in combination with state-of-the-art atomic calculations. The computed values $t_{1/2} = 2.23^{+5.24}_{-1.28} \times 10^7$ years and $\textrm{Br} = 3.07^{+4.16}_{-2.15} \times 10^{-8}$, along with the thermal-neutron capture on stable $^{109}$Ag as a viable production method, make $^{110}\textrm{Ag}^m$ a promising candidate for future antineutrino-mass measurements.</description>

      <title>Moments of Axial-Vector GPD from Lattice QCD: Quark Helicity, Orbital Angular Momentum, and Spin-Orbit Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the Mellin moments of the twist-2 axial-vector generalized parton distribution (GPD), $\widetilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$, at zero skewness, $\xi$, with multiple values of the momentum transfer, $t$. Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_\pi = 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while omitting the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal DVCS and transition GPDs: A unified framework for spinless hadron case $\gamma^* \pi \to \gamma \pi \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadron-to-two-hadron transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) extend the concept of hadron-to-resonance transition GPDs and provide a unified description of non-diagonal hard exclusive reactions in the generalized Bjorken limit. We present the formalism for the case of spinless hadrons addressing the non-diagonal deeply virtual Compton scattering $\gamma^*\pi\to\gamma\pi\pi$ in terms of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs, which generalize GPDs for $\pi \to f_0, \, \rho, \, f_2, \, \cdots$ transitions. We work out the basic properties of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs and establish the soft pion theorems at the $2\pi$ production threshold. We construct the partial wave expansion of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in the two-pion decay angles and employ the dispersive approach to constrain $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in terms of $\pi\pi$-scattering phases with help of the Omn\`{e}s representation. We estimate the $e^-\pi^+ \to e^- \gamma \pi^+ \pi^0$ cross section in the kinematics of the JLab@12 GeV incorporating the isolated $\rho(770)$ resonance state and work out the angular distributions of the cross section, specifying the observables sensitive to the polarization states of the produced $\rho(770)$ resonance.</description>
