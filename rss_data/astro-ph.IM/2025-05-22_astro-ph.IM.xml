      <title>Modified crossed Dragone optical design of the LiteBIRD low-frequency telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiteBIRD is a JAXA-led international project aimed at measuring the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization with high sensitivity to detect polarization $B$ modes. This detection would provide evidence of inflation. LiteBIRD will observe the full sky for three years at the L2 Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system across 34-448 GHz, and is expected to launch in the Japanese fiscal year of 2032. The Low-Frequency Telescope (LFT) will observe in the 34-161 GHz range implementing a modified crossed Dragone (MCD) reflective optical design optimized for high optical performance across a wide $18^{\circ} \times 9^{\circ}$ field-of-view (FOV). In this paper, we report the LFT optical design details including its optimization and optical performance assessed using optical simulations. The MCD design consists of a paraboloidal primary and a hyperboloidal secondary reflector with polynomial correction terms up to 7th order, achieving Strehl ratios $\ge 0.97$ at 161 GHz across the FOV. The Mueller QU (UQ) cross-polarization response is $\le -26.9$ dB at 34 GHz. The simulated beam sizes are $&lt; 78^{\prime}$ at 34 GHz. The simulated sidelobe response for the direct and diffuse triple reflection sidelobes are estimated to be $&lt; -57$ dB, and for the focused triple reflection sidelobe $&lt; -37$ dB at 34 GHz. The LFT optical design satisfies all the optical requirements and specifications for the project, and is compatible with the LiteBIRD science goals.</description>

      <title>BLINK: an End-To-End GPU High Time Resolution Imaging Pipeline for Fast Radio Burst Searches with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Petabytes of archival high time resolution observations have been captured with the Murchison Widefield Array. The search for Fast Radio Bursts within these using established software has been limited by its inability to scale on supercomputing infrastructure, necessary to meet the associated computational and memory requirements. Hence, past searches used a coarse integration time, in the scale of seconds, or analysed an insufficient number of hours of observations. This paper introduces BLINK, a novel radio interferometry imaging software for low-frequency FRB searches to be run on modern supercomputers. It is implemented as a suite of software libraries executing all computations on GPU, supporting both AMD and NVIDIA hardware vendors. These libraries are designed to interface with each other and to define the BLINK imaging pipeline as a single executable program. Expensive I/O operations between imaging stages are not necessary because the stages now share the same memory space and data representation. BLINK is the first imaging pipeline implementation able to fully run on GPUs as a single process, further supporting AMD hardware and enabling Australian researchers to take advantage of Pawsey's Setonix supercomputer. In the millisecond-scale time resolution imaging test case illustrated in this paper, representative of what is required for FRB searches, the BLINK imaging pipeline achieves a 3687x speedup compared to a traditional MWA imaging pipeline employing WSClean.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Machine Learning Approach for Nanometric Axial Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.</description>

      <title>A Census of Compact Elliptical Galaxies in the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact elliptical (cE) galaxies are compact stellar systems with stellar masses of $10^8 \leq M_*/M_\odot \leq 10^{10}$ and radii typically &lt; 0.6 kpc. Here we investigate the properties of 13 cE galaxies in the Coma cluster, six newly identified. Our goal in this paper is to explore whether these cEs form directly in the cluster environment or are pre-processed in small groups before infalling. We find that pre-processing in groups significantly contributes to the cE population in the Coma cluster. We analyze Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) g band Coma images and validate our photometric measurements through comparison with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. We also analyze spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We significantly expand the known cE population in the Coma cluster through joint photometric and spectroscopic selection. We identify a subpopulation of cEs that likely formed in infalling groups, through their association with host galaxies, their positions on the caustic diagram, and their projected phase-space trajectories. We estimate that the central cE population will increase by 30% within the next 0.4 Gyr, highlighting the important role of pre-processing in cE evolution.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Laboratory Benchmark of K-shell Dielectronic Satellites of Fe XXV-XXI Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on comprehensive laboratory studies of the K-shell dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances of Fe XXV - XXI ions that prominently contribute to the hard X-ray spectrum of hot astrophysical plasmas. By scanning a monoenergetic electron beam to resonantly excite trapped Fe ions in an electron beam ion trap, and achieving a high electron-ion collision energy resolution of ~7 eV, we resolve their respective KL$n$ satellites up to n'=11. By normalization to known radiative recombination cross sections we also determine their excitation cross sections and that of the continuum with uncertainties below 15%, and verify our results with an independent normalization based on previous measurements. Our experimental data excellently confirm the accuracy and suitability of distorted-wave calculations obtained with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) for modeling astrophysical and fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>PINCH: Pipeline-Informed Noise Characterization of Gravitational Wave Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to identify and categorize gravitational wave candidate triggers identified by matched filtering gravitational wave searches (pipelines) caused by transient noise (glitches) in gravitational wave detectors using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Our approach involves training SVM models on pipeline triggers which occur outside periods of excess noise to distinguish between triggers caused by random noise and those induced by glitches. This method is applied independently to the triggers produced by the GstLAL search pipeline on data from the LIGO Hanford and Livingston observatories during the second half of the O3 observing run. The trained SVM models assign scores to ambiguous triggers, quantifying their similarity to triggers caused by random fluctuations, with triggers with scores above a defined threshold being classified as glitch-induced. Analysis of these triggers reveals the distinct impact of different glitch classes on the search pipeline, including their distribution in relevant parameter spaces. We use metrics such as the Bhattacharyya coefficient and an over-representation ratio to quantify the consistency and prevalence of glitch impacts over time and across parameter spaces. Our findings demonstrate that certain glitch types disproportionately affect specific regions of the parameter space, and that certain glitch types manifest themselves in the eyes of the pipeline in consistent ways while other types vary significantly. This method provides a framework for understanding and mitigating the influence of non-Gaussian transients on gravitational wave search pipelines, with implications for improving detection sensitivity and better understanding noise populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008, has over 16 years of operations providing gamma ray (8 keV to 300 Gev) spectra science observations of cosmic phenomena. It continues to provide invaluable research for the astrophysics community which include the study of pulsars, cosmic rays, gamma ray bursts, and coordination with gravity wave observations for neutron star mergers. The Fermi Earth orbit at a 500 x 512 km altitude is subject to collision warnings due to new constellations deployed near Fermi: currently over 7,000 satellites and growing. This paper presents analysis concerning changing Fermi's orbit and associated operational flight dynamics considerations. The cadence of burns and expected fuel use for a proposed orbit raise scenario is examined, ensuring that Fermi should have sufficient fuel for end of life operations. In addition, a Monte Carlo design is presented to capture single maneuver model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Selection of optically variable active galactic nuclei via a random forest algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. A defining characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that distinguishes them from other astronomical sources is their stochastic variability, which is observable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Upcoming optical wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, are set to transform astronomy by delivering unprecedented volumes of data for time domain studies. This data influx will require the development of the expertise and methodologies necessary to manage and analyze it effectively. Aims. This project focuses on optimizing AGN selection through optical variability in wide-field surveys and aims to reduce the bias against obscured AGN. We tested a random forest (RF) algorithm trained on various feature sets to select AGN. The initial dataset consisted of 54 observations in the r-band and 25 in the g-band of the COSMOS field, captured with the VLT Survey Telescope over a 3.3-year baseline. Methods. Our analysis relies on feature sets derived separately from either band plus a set of features combining data from both bands, mostly characterizing AGN on the basis of their variability properties and obtained from their light curves. We trained multiple RF classifiers using different subsets of selected features and assessed their performance via targeted metrics. Results. Our tests provide valuable insights into the use of multiband and multivisit data for AGN identification. We compared our findings with previous studies and dedicated part of the analysis to potential enhancements in selecting obscured AGN. The expertise gained and the methodologies developed here are readily applicable to datasets from other ground- and space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective optimization for scattering mitigation and scattering screen reconstruction in VLBI observations of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse problem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which is obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the one-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the scattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the Galactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its effect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization landscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen affecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a wide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230 GHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz. Our analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in imaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in weakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The successful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event horizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the study of the scattering screen itself.</description>

      <title>dfreproject: A Python package for astronomical reprojection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep astronomical images are often constructed by digitially stacking many individual sub-exposures. Each sub-exposure is expected to show small differences in the positions of stars and other objects in the field, due to the movement of the celestial bodies, changes/imperfections in the opto-mechanical imaging train, and other factors. To maximize image quality, one must ensure that each sub-exposure is aligned to a common frame of reference prior to stacking. This is done by reprojecting each exposure onto a common target grid defined using a World Coordinate System (WCS) that is defined by mapping the known angular positions of reference objects to their observed spatial positions on each image. The transformations needed to reproject images involve complicated trigonometric expressions which can be slow to compute, so reprojection can be a major bottleneck in image processing pipelines.
  To make astronomical reprojections faster to implement in pipelines, we have written `dfreproject`, a Python package of GPU-optimized functions for this purpose. The package's functions break down coordinate transformations using Gnomonic projections to define pixel-by-pixel shifts from the source to the target plane. The package also provides tools for interpolating a source image onto a target plane with a single function call. This module follows the FITS and SIP formats laid out in the seminal papers. Compared to common alternatives, `dfreproject`'s routines result in speedups of up to 20X when run on a GPU and 10X when run on a CPU.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensor networks in combination with traditional astronomical observations are emerging as a novel modality for multi-messenger astronomy. Here we develop a generic analysis framework that uses a data-driven approach to model the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network to astrophysical signals as a consequence of beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) physics. The analysis method evaluates correlations between sensors to search for BSM signals coincident with astrophysical triggers such as black hole mergers, supernovae, or fast radio bursts. Complementary to astroparticle approaches that search for particlelike signals (e.g. WIMPs), quantum sensors are sensitive to wavelike signals from exotic quantum fields. This analysis method can be applied to networks of different types of quantum sensors, such as atomic clocks, matter-wave interferometers, and nuclear clocks, which can probe many types of interactions between BSM fields and standard model particles.
  We use this analysis method to carry out the first direct search utilizing a terrestrial network of precision quantum sensors for BSM fields emitted during a black hole merger. Specifically we use the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics (GNOME) to perform a search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated in coincidence with a gravitational wave signal from a binary black hole merger (GW200311 115853) detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020. The associated gravitational wave heralds the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts with the spins of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. Our search found no significant events, and consequently we place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>A statistical study of Lopsided Galaxies using Random Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lopsided galaxies are late-type galaxies with a non-axisymmetric disc due to an uneven distribution of their stellar mass. Despite being a relatively common perturbation, several questions regarding its origin and the information that can be extracted from them about the evolutionary history of late-type galaxies. The advent of several large multi-band photometric surveys will allow us to statistically analyze this perturbation, with information that was not previously available. Given the strong correlation between lopsidedness and the structural properties of the galaxies, this paper aims to develop a method to automatically classify late-type galaxies between lopsided and symmetric. We seek to explore if an accurate classification can be obtain by only considering their internal properties, without additional information about the environment. We select 8000 late-type galaxies from TNG50. A Fourier decomposition of their stellar mass surface density is used to label galaxies as lopsided and symmetric. We trained a Random Forest classifier to rapidly and automatically identify this type of perturbations, exclusively using galaxies internal properties. We test different algorithms to deal with the imbalance of our data and select the most suitable approach based on the considered metrics. We show that our trained algorithm can provide a very accurate and rapid classification of lopsided galaxies. The excellent results obtained by our classifier strongly supports the hypothesis that lopsidedness is mainly a tracer of galaxies internal structures. We show that similar results can be obtained using observable quantities, readily obtainable from multi-bad photometric surveys. Our results show it allows a rapid and accurate classification of lopsided galaxies, allowing us to explore whether lopsidedness in present-day disc galaxies is connected to galaxies specific evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from CO2 or CO and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in PO and CO2, various alternative compositions, including H2O-,CO-, PH3-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>

      <title>A novel approach of optimizing the image cleaning performance of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes: Application to a time-based cleaning for H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a time-based cleaning method for H.E.S.S. using CT5 in monoscopic mode and presents an optimization workflow for image-cleaning algorithms to enhance telescope sensitivity while minimizing systematic biases. We evaluate three methods - tail-cut cleaning and two flavours of time-based cleaning TIME3D and TIME4D - and find best-cut configurations for two cases: optimal overall sensitivity and minimal energy threshold. TIME3D achieves a $\sim 15\%$ improvement with regard to the standard tail-cut cleaning for $E &lt; 300$ GeV, with a $\sim 200\%$ improvement for the first energy bin (36.5 GeV &lt; E &lt; 64.9 GeV), providing a more stable performance across a wider energy range by preserving more signal. TIME4D achieves a $\sim 20\%$ improvement at low energies due to superior NSB noise suppression, allowing for an enhanced capability of detecting sources at the lowest energies. We demonstrate that using first-order estimations of the performance of a cleaning, such as image size retaining or NSB pixel reduction, cannot provide a full picture of the expected result in the final sensitivity. Beyond expanding the effective area at low energies, sensitivity improvement requires precise event reconstruction, including improved energy and directional accuracy. Enhanced gamma-hadron separation and optimized pre-selection cuts further boost sensitivity. The proposed pipeline fully explores this, providing a fair and robust comparison between different cleaning methods. The method is general and can be applied to other IACT systems like VERITAS, MAGIC. By advancing data-driven image cleaning, this work lays the groundwork for detecting faint astrophysical sources and deepening our understanding of high-energy cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>How to use Gaia parallaxes for stars with poor astrometric fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry, we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically, and sources blended with neighboring sources.</description>

      <title>Adjusting optical cavity birefringence with wavelength tunable laser for axion searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06770</link>

Abstract: Axions have attracted attention as promising candidates for dark matter (DM). Although axions have been intensively searched for, they have not been observed yet. Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that use optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by the axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity composed of four mirrors. However, its sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ in the low axion mass region is limited due to a reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the sensitivity using zero-phase shift mirrors and a wavelength tunable laser. Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high axion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. We experimentally confirmed that the phase difference generated upon reflection on a zero phase shift mirror satisfies the requirement of $8.6 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{deg}$, which corresponds to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the p-polarization with the mirror fixed on a folded cavity and a wavelength tunable laser.</description>

      <title>Improving the {\Gamma}-functions Method for Vortex Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortices have been observed at various heights within the solar atmosphere and are suggested to potentially play great roles in heating the solar upper atmosphere. Multiple automated vortex detection methods have been developed and applied to detect vortices. We aim to improve the $\Gamma$-functions method for vortex identification by optimizing the value of $\Gamma_{1min}$ and the approach to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ used to determine vortex center and edge. In this way, we can detect vortices more accurately and enable more statistical studies that can improve our knowledge of the generation and evolution of vortices in the solar atmosphere. We apply the automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA, one representative of $\Gamma$-functions method) with different parameters to various synthetic data, with each containing 1000 Lamb-Oseen vortices, and search for the optimal $\Gamma_{1min}$ and kernel size when calculating $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. We also compare another detection method using simulation and observational data to validate the results obtained from the synthetic data. The best performance is found with the Optimized ASDA, which combines different kernel sizes (5, 7, 9, and 11) to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ with a fixed $\Gamma_{1min}$ = 0.63 to detect vortex center. We find that more vortices can be detected by the Optimized ASDA with higher location, radius, and rotation speed accuracies. The above results are further confirmed by comparing vortices detected by the Optimized ASDA and the SWIRL method on CO5BOLD numerical simulation data and SST observational data.</description>
