      <title>Moments to All Orders from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. We propose to use momentum instead of distance as a leverage to extract moments at a given order. Moreover, by utilizing symmetry of the lattice matrix elements, we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>An extended framework for the HMC in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an extended framework for the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm in lattice gauge theory by embedding the $SU(N)$ group into the space of general complex matrices,$M_N(\mathbb{C})$. Auxiliary directions will be completely factorized in the path integral, and the embedding does not alter the expectation values of the original theory. We perform the molecular dynamics updates by using the matrix elements of $W \in M_N(\mathbb{C})$ as the dynamical variables without group theoretic constraints. The framework enables us to introduce non-separable Hamiltonians for the HMC in lattice gauge theory exactly, whose immediate application includes the Riemannian manifold HMC.</description>

      <title>Quark Transverse Spin-Momentum Correlation of the Pion from Lattice QCD: The Boer-Mulders Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the quark transverse spin-momentum correlation, i.e., the T-odd Boer-Mulders function, of the pion, using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). The calculation is done at three lattice spacings $a=(0.098, 0.085, 0.064)$ fm and pion masses $\sim350$ MeV, with pion momenta up to $1.8$ GeV. The matrix elements are renormalized in a state-of-the-art scheme and extrapolated to the continuum and infinite momentum limit. We have implemented the perturbative matching up to the next-to-next-to-leading order and carried out a renormalization-group resummation. Our results provide valuable input for phenomenological analyses of the Boer-Mulders single-spin asymmetry.</description>

      <title>One-loop Matching Factors for Singlet Quasi-Parton Distribution Functions in the Hybrid-Ratio Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one loop matching kernels between parton distribution functions (PDFs) for parton $i=u,d,s,g$ and their corresponding quasi-PDFs are computed at one loop in the hybrid-ratio scheme. We found that, in addition to the conservation of the quasi-quark number for each flavor, the second moment $\langle x \rangle_{\tilde{i}}=\langle x \rangle_i$ of quasi-PDF of parton $i$ (denoted as $\tilde{i}$) and PDF of parton $i$ is the same in our approach. This is demonstrated numerically using the CTEQ14 global analysis as input. However, because the quark-quark mixing kernels are not flavor blind, the notion of non-singlet quasi-PDFs is no longer valid. One has to work with the four sets of quasi-PDFs simultaneously to extract the corresponding PDFs.</description>

      <title>Random Matrix Theory for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the dynamics of learning in machine learning algorithms is of paramount importance for understanding how and why an approach may be successful. The tools of physics and statistics provide a robust setting for such investigations. Here we apply concepts from random matrix theory to describe stochastic weight matrix dynamics, using the framework of Dyson Brownian motion. We derive the linear scaling rule between the learning rate (step size) and the batch size, and identify universal and non-universal aspects of weight matrix dynamics. We test our findings in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine and in a linear one-hidden-layer neural network.</description>

      <title>The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries: the glueton and the quarkiton. The glueton, or "gluon exciton", is a colorless bound state formed by gluons interacting with their negatively colored images in a chromometallic mirror. The quarkiton, or "quark exciton", is a meson-like state comprising a heavy quark attracted to its image through the mirror. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition $(T \approx 0.78 T_c)$, where we observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and, presumably, gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions. Furthermore, we find a striking universality: the ratio of the glueton mass to the bulk $0^{++}$ glueball mass - defining the bulk mass gap - matches the ratio of the quarkiton string tension to the string tension between quark and anti-quark in the absence of the mirror, with a value $\mathcal{R} = 0.294(11)$.</description>

      <title>The curvature of the pseudo-critical line in the QCD phase diagram from mesonic lattice correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the QCD phase diagram, the dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature, $T_{\rm pc}$, on the baryon chemical potential, $\mu_B$, is of fundamental interest. The variation of $T_{\rm pc}$ with $\mu_B$ is normally captured by $\kappa$, the coefficient of the leading (quadratic) term of the polynomial expansion of $T_{\rm pc}$ with $\mu_B$. In this work, we present the first calculation of $\kappa$ using hadronic quantities. Simulating $N_f=2+1$ flavours of Wilson fermions on {\sc Fastsum} ensambles, we calculate the $\mathcal{O}(\mu_B^2)$ correction to mesonic correlation functions. By demanding degeneracy in the vector and axial vector channels we obtain $T_{\rm pc}(\mu_B)$ and hence $\kappa$. While lacking a continuum extrapolation and being away from the physical point, our results are consistent with previous works using thermodynamic observables (renormalised chiral condensate, strange quark number susceptibility) from lattice QCD simulations with staggered fermions.</description>

      <title>Using AI for Efficient Statistical Inference of Lattice Correlators Across Mass Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD is notorious for its computational expense. Modern lattice simulations require large-scale computational resources to handle the large number of Dirac operator inversions used to construct correlation functions. Machine learning (ML) techniques that can increase, at the analysis level, the information inferred from the correlation functions would therefore be beneficial. We apply supervised learning to infer two-point lattice correlation functions at different target masses. Our work proposes a new method for separating data into training and bias correction subsets for efficient uncertainty estimation. We also benchmark our ML models against a simple ratio method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gauge covariance of the quark gap equation is compared for three quark-gluon vertices: the bare vertex, a Ball-Chiu like vertex constrained by the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identity, and a full vertex including the transverse components derived from transverse Slavnov-Taylor identities. The covariance properties are verified with the chiral quark condensate and the pion decay constant in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Spectral sum rules and phase transition in strongly coupled QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By incorporating contributions from both the (chromo)electric scale $gT$ and (chromo)magnetic scale $g^2T$, we establish spectral sum rules of quarks for strongly coupled QCD that respect Fermi-Dirac statistics as required by quantum mechanics. In sharp contrast to QED and weakly coupled QCD whose spectral functions consist of discontinuous zero-dimensional (poles) and one-dimensional (branch cuts) non-analytic contributions from real energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, the derived spectral function for strongly coupled quarks features continuous but non-analytic contributions from complex energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ that are two-dimensional in nature. In light of the novel sum rules, we uncover an intrinsic QCD transition between a three-mode phase at small coupling and a one-mode phase at large coupling. The transition is induced by the magnetic scale that generates a massless hydro-like mode with the genuine non-Abelian feature of positivity violation and serving as the Goldstone mode of the Lorentz symmetry breaking. The thermal mass serves as an order parameter of the transition and vanishes at large coupling in line with phenomenological predictions from Dyson-Schwinger equations and gauge/gravity duality. This result provides novel insights into the mechanism of the QCD deconfinement transition.</description>

      <title>Cascading from $\mathscr{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory to Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Adjoint QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that adjoint QCD in 3+1 dimensions, with any $SU(N)$ gauge group and two Weyl fermion flavors (i.e. one adjoint Dirac fermion), confines and spontaneously breaks its chiral symmetries via the condensation of a fermion bilinear. We flow to this theory from pure $\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the scalars in the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed rigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of the $\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$ using an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole points of the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$ hypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We provide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by analyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase transitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and which interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i = 0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \neq 0$, at sufficiently large $M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and chiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken and unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$ scaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \to U(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate alignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, the connection between the smallness of the neutrino masses and the stability of the proton is studied. We analyze this connection from different perspectives: the smallness of neutrino mass and the proton stability originate from the same source, small neutrino masses lead to a long lived proton, and the smallness of the proton decay width as a cause of the naturally small neutrino masses. All the schemes are studied in detail and UV realizations are given. We discuss advantages of each scheme and outline further investigation directions.</description>

      <title>Triply charmed baryons mass decomposition from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the connected scalar matrix element and the momentum fraction of charm quark within the$\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons on lattice QCD. The results are based on overlap valence fermions on two ensembles of $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion configurations with two lattice spacings. The corresponding sea quark pion masses are $300$ MeV and $278$ MeV. The separated contributions to the triply charmed baryon mass are derived through the decomposition of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. The contribution of the connected charm quark matrix element to the triply charmed baryon is about 3/2 times that of the charmonium. And it contributes almost 70\% of the total mass. The mass splitting of $\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons is mainly from $\langle H_{E}\rangle$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. A mass decomposition from the quark model is also studied for comparison.</description>

      <title>Fast Partitioning of Pauli Strings into Commuting Families for Optimal Expectation Value Measurements of Dense Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli strings appearing in the decomposition of an operator can be can be grouped into commuting families, reducing the number of quantum circuits needed to measure the expectation value of the operator. We detail an algorithm to completely partition the full set of Pauli strings acting on any number of qubits into the minimal number of sets of commuting families, and we provide python code to perform the partitioning. The partitioning method scales linearly with the size of the set of Pauli strings and it naturally provides a fast method of diagonalizing the commuting families with quantum gates. We provide a package that integrates the partitioning into Qiskit, and use this to benchmark the algorithm with dense Hamiltonians, such as those that arise in matrix quantum mechanics models, on IBM hardware. We demonstrate computational speedups close to the theoretical limit of $(3/2)^m$ relative to qubit-wise commuting groupings, for $m=2,\dotsc,6$ qubits.</description>
