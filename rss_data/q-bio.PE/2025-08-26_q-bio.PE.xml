      <title>Adaptation to extreme stress under the growth-survival fitness trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbial adaptation to extreme stress, such as starvation, antimicrobial exposure, or freezing often reveals fundamental trade-offs between survival and proliferation. Understanding how populations navigate these trade-offs in fluctuating environments remains a central challenge. We develop a quantitative model to investigate the adaptation of populations of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) subjected to cycles of growth and extreme freeze-thaw stress, focusing on the role of quiescence as a mediator of survival. Our model links key life-history traits: growth rate, lag time, quiescence probability, and stress survival, to a single underlying phenotype, motivated by the role of intracellular trehalose in the adaptation of yeast to freeze-thaw stress. Through stochastic population simulations and analytical calculation of the long-term growth rate, we identify the evolutionary attractors of the system. We find that the strength of the growth-survival trade-off depends critically on environmental parameters, such as the duration of the growth phase. Crucially, our analysis reveals that populations optimized for growth-stress cycles can often maintain viability alongside growth-optimized populations even in the absence of stress. This demonstrates that underlying physiological trade-offs do not necessarily translate into fitness trade-offs at the population level, providing general insights into the complex interplay between environmental fluctuations, physiological constraints, and evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of fixation probability in a population with fluctuating size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many biological processes, the size of a population changes stochastically with time, and recent work in the context of cancer and bacterial growth have focused on the situation when the mean population size grows exponentially. Here, motivated by the evolutionary process of genetic hitchhiking in a selectively neutral population, we consider a model in which the mean size of the population increases linearly. We are interested in understanding how the fluctuations in the population size impact the first passage statistics, and study the fixation probability that a mutant reaches frequency one by a given time in a population whose size follows a conditional Wright-Fisher process. We find that at sufficiently short and long times, the fixation probability can be approximated by a model that ignores temporal correlations between the inverse of the population size, but at intermediate times, it is significantly smaller than that obtained by neglecting the correlations. Our analytical and numerical study of the correlation functions show that the conditional Wright-Fisher process of interest is neither a stationary nor a Gaussian process; we also find that the variance of the inverse population size initially increases linearly with time $t$ and then decreases as $t^{-2}$ at intermediate times followed by an exponential decay at longer times. Our work emphasizes the importance of temporal correlations in populations with fluctuating size that are often ignored in population-genetic studies of biological evolution.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the temporal dependence of ecological interaction measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species interactions (ranging from direct predator prey relationships to indirect effects mediated by the environment) are central to ecosystem balance and biodiversity. While empirical methods for measuring these interactions exist, their interpretability and limitations remain unclear. Here we examine the empirical matrix of pairwise interactions, a widely used tool, and analyze its temporal variability. We show that apparent fluctuations in interaction strength (and even shifts in interaction signs, often interpreted as transitions between competition and facilitation) can arise intrinsically from population dynamics with fixed ecological roles. Experimental protocols further shape these estimates: the duration of observation and the type of setup in microbial growth studies (e.g., chemostats, batch cultures, or resource conditions) systematically affect measured interactions. Considering interactions across timescales enhances interpretability: short-term measurements primarily capture direct species couplings, whereas long-term observations increasingly reflect indirect community feedback. Taken together, these results establish short duration inferences, obtained either directly or extrapolated, as a principled way to disentangle direct from indirect interactions. Building on this insight, we propose a model inference approach that leverages multiple short time series rather than extended longitudinal datasets.</description>

      <title>Continuous limits of large plant-pollinator random networks and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic individual-based model of interacting plant and pollinator species through a bipartite graph: each species is a node of the graph, an edge representing interactions between a pair of species. The dynamics of the system depends on the between- and within-species interactions: pollination by insects increases plant reproduction rate but has a cost which can increase plant death rate, depending on the densities of pollinators. Pollinators reproduction is increased by the resources harvested on plants. Each species is characterized by a trait corresponding to its degree of generalism. This trait determines the structure of the interaction graph and the quantities of resources exchanged between species. Our model includes in particular nested or modular networks. Deterministic approximations of the stochastic measure-valued process by systems of ordinary differential equations or integro-differential equations are established and studied, when the population is large or when the graph is dense and can be replaced with a graphon. The long-time behaviors of these limits are studied and central limit theorems are established to quantify the difference between the discrete stochastic individual-based model and the deterministic approximations. Finally, studying the continuous limits of the interaction network and the resulting PDEs, we show that nested plant-pollinator communities are expected to collapse towards a coexistence between a single pair of species of plants and pollinators.</description>
