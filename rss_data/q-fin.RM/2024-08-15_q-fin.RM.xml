      <title>The Concentration Risk Indicator: Raising the Bar for Financial Stability and Portfolio Performance Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a novel risk management measure called the concentration risk indicator (CRI). The CRI has been created to address drawbacks with prevailing methodologies and to supplement existing methods. Modified and adapted from the Herfindahl-Hirschman (HH) index, the CRI can give a single numeric score that can be helpful to evaluate the extent of risks that arise from holding concentrated portfolios. We discuss how the CRI can become an indicator of financial stability at any desired aggregation unit: regional, national or international level. We show how the CRI can be easily applied to insurance risk and to any product portfolio mix. The CRI is particularly applicable to the current facet of the decentralized terrain, wherein the majority of the wealth is restricted to a small number of tokens. We calculate and report the CRI -- along with other risk metrics -- for individual assets and portfolios of crypto assets using a daily data sample from January 01, 2019 until August 10, 2022. The CRI is an example of developing metrics that can useful for sending concise yet powerful messages to the relevant audience. This tactic -- which can be described as marketing the benefits of any product or service by using concepts from multiple disciplines -- of creating new metrics goes further beyond the use of metrics to evaluate marketing efficacy. The simplicity of our metric -- and the intuitive explanations we have provided for the CRI -- makes it straightforward to properly articulate a strong -- clear and positive -- signal as part of marketing campaigns. The development -- and implementation -- of new risk management metrics will have greater impact when a wider rigorous risk management process has been established. We discuss several topics related to bringing about more improved risk management across all types of institutions and assets.</description>

      <title>Efficiency in Pure-Exchange Economies with Risk-Averse Monetary Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Pareto efficiency in a pure-exchange economy where agents' preferences are represented by risk-averse monetary utilities. These coincide with law-invariant monetary utilities, and they can be shown to correspond to the class of monotone, (quasi-)concave, Schur concave, and translation-invariant utility functionals. This covers a large class of utility functionals, including a variety of law-invariant robust utilities. We show that Pareto optima exist and are comonotone, and we provide a crisp characterization thereof in the case of law-invariant positively homogeneous monetary utilities. This characterization provides an easily implementable algorithm that fully determines the shape of Pareto-optimal allocations. In the special case of law-invariant comonotone-additive monetary utility functionals (concave Yaari-Dual utilities), we provide a closed-form characterization of Pareto optima. As an application, we examine risk-sharing markets where all agents evaluate risk through law-invariant coherent risk measures, a widely popular class of risk measures. In a numerical illustration, we characterize Pareto-optimal risk-sharing for some special types of coherent risk measures.</description>
