      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Downlink Transmit Precoding for Mitigating the Impact of Delayed CSI in Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites with terrestrial communication networks holds the promise of seamless global connectivity. The efficiency of this connection, however, depends on the availability of reliable channel state information (CSI). Due to the large space-ground propagation delays, the estimated CSI is outdated. In this paper we consider the downlink of a satellite operating as a base station in support of multiple mobile users. The estimated outdated CSI is used at the satellite side to design a transmit precoding (TPC) matrix for the downlink. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to optimize the TPC matrices, with the goal of maximizing the achievable data rate. We utilize the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to handle the continuous action space, and we employ state augmentation techniques to deal with the delayed observations and rewards. We show that the DRL agent is capable of exploiting the time-domain correlations of the channels for constructing accurate TPC matrices. This is because the proposed method is capable of compensating for the effects of delayed CSI in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we study the effect of handovers in the system, and show that the DRL agent is capable of promptly adapting to the environment when a handover occurs.</description>

      <title>LiquiRIS: A Major Step Towards Fast Beam Switching in Liquid Crystal-based RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer enhanced control over propagation through phase and amplitude manipulation but face practical challenges like cost and power usage, especially at high frequencies. This is specifically a major problem at high frequencies (Ka- and V-band) where the high cost of semiconductor components (i.e., diodes, varactors, MEMSs) can make RISs prohibitively costly. In recent years, it is shown that liquid crystals (LCs) are low-cost and low-energy alternative which can address the aforementioned challenges but at the cost of lower response time. In LiquiRIS, we enable leveraging LC-based RIS in mobile networks. Specifically, we devise techniques that minimize the beam switching time of LC-based RIS by tapping into the physical properties of LCs and the underlying mathematical principles of beamforming. We achieve this by modeling and optimizing the beamforming vector to account for the rotation characteristics of LC molecules to reduce their transition time from one state to another. In addition to prototyping the proposed system, we show via extensive experimental analysis that LiquiRIS substantially reduces the response time (up to 70.80%) of liquid crystal surface (LCS).</description>

      <title>Multiple-beam Interference Spectroscopy: Instrument Analysis and Spectrum Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging systems based on multiple-beam interference (MBI), such as Fabry-Perot interferometry, are attracting interest due to their compact design, high throughput, and fine resolution. Unlike dispersive devices, which measure spectra directly, the desired spectra in interferometric systems are reconstructed from measured interferograms. Although the response of MBI devices is modeled by the Airy function, existing reconstruction techniques are often limited to Fourier-transform spectroscopy, which is tailored for two-beam interference (TBI). These methods impose limitations for MBI and are susceptible to non-idealities like irregular sampling and noise, highlighting the need for an in-depth numerical framework. To fill this gap, we propose a rigorous taxonomy of the TBI and MBI instrument description and propose a unified Bayesian formulation which both embeds the description of existing literature works and adds some of the real-world non-idealities of the acquisition process. Under this framework, we provide a comprehensive review of spectroscopy forward and inverse models. In the forward model, we propose a thorough analysis of the discretization of the continuous model and the ill-posedness of the problem. In the inverse model, we extend the range of existing solutions for spectrum reconstruction, framing them as an optimization problem. Specifically, we provide a progressive comparative analysis of reconstruction methods from more specific to more general scenarios, up to employing the proposed Bayesian framework with prior knowledge, such as sparsity constraints. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate the framework's flexibility and noise robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/mhmdjouni/inverspyctrometry.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Allocation and Time Sharing in Low Rank Multi-carrier Wi-Fi Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-evolving landscape of distributed wireless systems, e.g. multi-user AR/VR systems, demands high data rates (up to 500 Mbps per user) and low power consumption. With increasing number of participating users, uplink data transmission in the situation where the number of transmitter user antennas exceeds the number of access point (AP) antennas presents a low-rank channel problem. Current Wi-Fi standards using orthogonal multiple access (OMA) fail to address these requirements. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based systems, while outperforming the OMA methods, still fall short of the requirement in low-rank channel uplink transmission, because they adhere to a single decoding order for successive interference cancelation (SIC). This paper proposes and develops a novel optimal power-subcarrier allocation algorithm to maximize the achieved data rates for this low rank channel scenario. Additionally, the proposed algorithm implements a novel time-sharing algorithm for simultaneously participating users, which adaptively varies the decoding orders to achieve higher data rates than any single decoding order. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves 39%, 28%, and 16% higher sum data rates than OMA, NOMA, and multi-carrier NOMA baselines respectively, under low-rank channel conditions, under varying SNR values. We further show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines with varying numbers of users or AP antennas, showing the effectiveness of the optimal power allocation and time-sharing.</description>

      <title>Scaling 6G Subscribers with Fewer BS Antennas using Multi-carrier NOMA in Fixed Wireless Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel power allocation and subcarrier optimization algorithm tailored for fixed wireless access (FWA) networks operating under low-rank channel conditions, where the number of subscriber antennas far exceeds those at the base station (BS). As FWA networks grow to support more users, traditional approaches like orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) struggle to maintain high data rates and energy efficiency due to the limited degrees of freedom in low-rank scenarios. Our proposed solution addresses this by combining optimal power-subcarrier allocation with an adaptive time-sharing algorithm that dynamically adjusts decoding orders to optimize performance across multiple users. The algorithm leverages a generalized decision feedback equalizer (GDFE) approach to effectively manage inter-symbol interference and crosstalk, leading to superior data rates and energy savings. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing OMA and NOMA baselines, particularly in low-rank conditions, with substantial gains in both data rate and energy efficiency. The findings highlight the potential of this method to meet the growing demand for scalable, high-performance FWA networks.</description>

      <title>MU-MIMO Symbol-Level Precoding for QAM Constellations with Maximum Likelihood Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate symbol-level precoding (SLP) and efficient decoding techniques for downlink transmission, where we focus on scenarios where the base station (BS) transmits multiple QAM constellation streams to users equipped with multiple receive antennas. We begin by formulating a joint symbol-level transmit precoding and receive combining optimization problem. This coupled problem is addressed by employing the alternating optimization (AO) method, and closed-form solutions are derived by analyzing the obtained two subproblems. Furthermore, to address the dependence of the receive combining matrix on the transmit signals, we switch to maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method for decoding. Notably, we have demonstrated that the smallest singular value of the precoding matrix significantly impacts the performance of MLD method. Specifically, a lower value of the smallest singular value results in degraded detection performance. Additionally, we show that the traditional SLP matrix is rank-one, making it infeasible to directly apply MLD at the receiver end. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel symbol-level smallest singular value maximization problem, termed SSVMP, to enable SLP in systems where users employ the MLD decoding approach. Moreover, to reduce the number of variables to be optimized, we further derive a more generic semidefinite programming (SDP)-based optimization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes and demonstrate that they significantly outperform the traditional block diagonalization (BD)-based method.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks for Predicting Motor Movements from Primate Motor Cortex Neural Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient deep learning solution for decoding motor movements from neural recordings in non-human primates. An Autoencoder Gated Recurrent Unit (AEGRU) model was adopted as the model architecture for this task. The autoencoder is only used during the training stage to achieve better generalization. Together with the preprocessing techniques, our model achieved 0.71 $R^2$ score, surpassing the baseline models in Neurobench and is ranked first for $R^2$ in the IEEE BioCAS 2024 Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Model pruning is also applied leading to a reduction of 41.4% of the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations with little change in the $R^2$ score compared to the unpruned model.</description>

      <title>LinFormer: A Linear-based Lightweight Transformer Architecture For Time-Aware MIMO Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 6th generation (6G) mobile networks brings new challenges in supporting high-mobility communications, particularly in addressing the issue of channel aging. While existing channel prediction methods offer improved accuracy at the expense of increased computational complexity, limiting their practical application in mobile networks. To address these challenges, we present LinFormer, an innovative channel prediction framework based on a scalable, all-linear, encoder-only Transformer model. Our approach, inspired by natural language processing (NLP) models such as BERT, adapts an encoder-only architecture specifically for channel prediction tasks. We propose replacing the computationally intensive attention mechanism commonly used in Transformers with a time-aware multi-layer perceptron (TMLP), significantly reducing computational demands. The inherent time awareness of TMLP module makes it particularly suitable for channel prediction tasks. We enhance LinFormer's training process by employing a weighted mean squared error loss (WMSELoss) function and data augmentation techniques, leveraging larger, readily available communication datasets. Our approach achieves a substantial reduction in computational complexity while maintaining high prediction accuracy, making it more suitable for deployment in cost-effective base stations (BS). Comprehensive experiments using both simulated and measured data demonstrate that LinFormer outperforms existing methods across various mobility scenarios, offering a promising solution for future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting On-Orbit Characteristics for Joint Parameter and Channel Tracking in LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-dynamic low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) systems, frequent channel state information (CSI) acquisition consumes a large number of pilots, which is intolerable in resource-limited SATCOM systems. To tackle this problem, we propose to track the state-dependent parameters including Doppler shift and channel angles, by exploiting the physical and approximate on-orbit mobility characteristics for LEO satellite and ground users (GUs), respectively. As a prerequisite for tracking, we formulate the state evolution models for kinematic (state) parameters of both satellite and GUs, along with the measurement models that describe the relationship between the state-dependent parameters and states. Then the rough estimation of state-dependent parameters is initially conducted, which is used as the measurement results in the subsequent state tracking. Concurrently, the measurement error covariance is predicted based on the formulated Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Finally, with the extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based state tracking as the bridge, the Doppler shift and channel angles can be further updated and the CSI can also be acquired. Simulation results show that compared to the rough estimation methods, the proposed joint parameter and channel tracking (JPCT) algorithm performs much better in the estimation of state-dependent parameters. Moreover, as to the CSI acquisition, the proposed algorithm can utilize a shorter pilot sequence than benchmark methods under a given estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Statistical Classification of Continuous Sequences with Distribution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multiple classification, one aims to determine whether a testing sequence is generated from the same distribution as one of the M training sequences or not. Unlike most of existing studies that focus on discrete-valued sequences with perfect distribution match, we study multiple classification for continuous sequences with distribution uncertainty, where the generating distributions of the testing and training sequences deviate even under the true hypothesis. In particular, we propose distribution free tests and prove that the error probabilities of our tests decay exponentially fast for three different test designs: fixed-length, sequential, and two-phase tests. We first consider the simple case without the null hypothesis, where the testing sequence is known to be generated from a distribution close to the generating distribution of one of the training sequences. Subsequently, we generalize our results to a more general case with the null hypothesis by allowing the testing sequence to be generated from a distribution that is vastly different from the generating distributions of all training sequences.</description>

      <title>PK-YOLO: Pretrained Knowledge Guided YOLO for Brain Tumor Detection in Multiplanar MRI Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor detection in multiplane Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices is a challenging task due to the various appearances and relationships in the structure of the multiplane images. In this paper, we propose a new You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based detection model that incorporates Pretrained Knowledge (PK), called PK-YOLO, to improve the performance for brain tumor detection in multiplane MRI slices. To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices. Experimental results show that the proposed PK-YOLO achieves competitive performance on the multiplanar MRI brain tumor detection datasets compared to state-of-the-art YOLO-like and DETR-like object detectors. The code is available at https://github.com/mkang315/PK-YOLO.</description>

      <title>$r$Age-$k$: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Using Age Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative approach where multiple clients, coordinated by a parameter server (PS), train a unified machine-learning model. The approach, however, suffers from two key challenges: data heterogeneity and communication overhead. Data heterogeneity refers to inconsistencies in model training arising from heterogeneous data at different clients. Communication overhead arises from the large volumes of parameter updates exchanged between the PS and clients. Existing solutions typically address these challenges separately. This paper introduces a new communication-efficient algorithm that uses the age of information metric to simultaneously tackle both limitations of FL. We introduce age vectors at the PS, which keep track of how often the different model parameters are updated from the clients. The PS uses this to selectively request updates for specific gradient indices from each client. Further, the PS employs age vectors to identify clients with statistically similar data and group them into clusters. The PS combines the age vectors of the clustered clients to efficiently coordinate gradient index updates among clients within a cluster. We evaluate our approach using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets in highly non-i.i.d. settings. The experimental results show that our proposed method can expedite training, surpassing other communication-efficient strategies in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Reverberation and Visual Depth Cues for Sound Event Localization and Detection with Distance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report describes our systems submitted for the DCASE2024 Task 3 challenge: Audio and Audiovisual Sound Event Localization and Detection with Source Distance Estimation (Track B). Our main model is based on the audio-visual (AV) Conformer, which processes video and audio embeddings extracted with ResNet50 and with an audio encoder pre-trained on SELD, respectively. This model outperformed the audio-visual baseline of the development set of the STARSS23 dataset by a wide margin, halving its DOAE and improving the F1 by more than 3x. Our second system performs a temporal ensemble from the outputs of the AV-Conformer. We then extended the model with features for distance estimation, such as direct and reverberant signal components extracted from the omnidirectional audio channel, and depth maps extracted from the video frames. While the new system improved the RDE of our previous model by about 3 percentage points, it achieved a lower F1 score. This may be caused by sound classes that rarely appear in the training set and that the more complex system does not detect, as analysis can determine. To overcome this problem, our fourth and final system consists of an ensemble strategy combining the predictions of the other three. Many opportunities to refine the system and training strategy can be tested in future ablation experiments, and likely achieve incremental performance gains for this audio-visual task.</description>

      <title>Mixing Signals: Data Augmentation Approach for Deep Learning Based Modulation Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, automatic modulation recognition (AMR), as an important task in cognitive radio, has gradually transformed from traditional feature extraction and classification to automatic classification by deep learning technology. However, deep learning models are data-driven methods, which often require a large amount of data as the training support. Data augmentation, as the strategy of expanding dataset, can improve the generalization of the deep learning models and thus improve the accuracy of the models to a certain extent. In this paper, for AMR of radio signals, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on mixing signals and consider four specific methods (Random Mixing, Maximum-Similarity-Mixing, $\theta-$Similarity Mixing and n-times Random Mixing) to achieve data augmentation. Experiments show that our proposed method can improve the classification accuracy of deep learning based AMR models in the full public dataset RML2016.10a. In particular, for the case of a single signal-to-noise ratio signal set, the classification accuracy can be significantly improved, which verifies the effectiveness of the methods.</description>

      <title>EMG Signal Classification for Neuromuscular Disorders with Attention-Enhanced CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Myopathy present considerable challenges in the realm of neuromuscular disorder diagnostics. In this study, we employ advanced deep-learning techniques to address the detection of ALS and Myopathy, two debilitating conditions. Our methodology begins with the extraction of informative features from raw electromyography (EMG) signals, leveraging the Log-spectrum, and Delta Log spectrum, which capture the frequency contents, and spectral and temporal characteristics of the signals. Subsequently, we applied a deep-learning model, SpectroEMG-Net, combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Attention for the classification of three classes. The robustness of our approach is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating its remarkable performance in distinguishing among the classes: Myopathy, Normal, and ALS, with an outstanding overall accuracy of 92\%. This study marks a contribution to addressing the diagnostic challenges posed by neuromuscular disorders through a data-driven, multi-class classification approach, providing valuable insights into the potential for early and accurate detection.</description>

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Myopathy are debilitating neuromuscular disorders that demand accurate and efficient diagnostic approaches. In this study, we harness the power of deep learning techniques to detect ALS and Myopathy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in this context. We present ResEMGNet, designed to identify ALS and Myopathy directly from raw electromyography (EMG) signals. Unlike traditional methods that require intricate handcrafted feature extraction, ResEMGNet takes raw EMG data as input, reducing computational complexity and enhancing practicality. Our approach was rigorously evaluated using various metrics in comparison to existing methods. ResEMGNet exhibited exceptional subject-independent performance, achieving an impressive overall three-class accuracy of 94.43\%.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Design Framework for UE-side and BS-Side RIS Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in emerging communication systems is a fast-growing research field that has recently earned much attention. While implementing RISs near the base station (BS), i.e., BS-side RIS, or user equipment (UE), i.e., UE-side RIS, exhibits optimum performance, understanding the differences between these two deployments in terms of the system design perspective needs to be clarified. Critical design parameters, such as RIS size, phase shift adjustment, control link, and element type (passive/active), require greater clarity across these scenarios. Overlooking the intricacies of such critical design parameters in light of 6G demands endangers practical implementation, widening the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications. In this regard, our study investigates the impact of each RIS deployment strategy on the anticipated 6G requirements and offers tailored RIS design recommendations to fulfill these forward-looking requirements. Through this, we clarify the practical distinctions and propose a comprehensive framework for differentiating between BS-side and UE-side RIS scenarios in terms of their design parameters. Highlighting the unique needs of each and the potential challenges ahead, we aim to fuse the theoretical underpinnings of RIS with tangible implementation considerations, propelling progress in both the academic sphere and the industry.</description>

      <title>EEG-Deformer: A Dense Convolutional Transformer for Brain-computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively learning the temporal dynamics in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is challenging yet essential for decoding brain activities using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Although Transformers are popular for their long-term sequential learning ability in the BCI field, most methods combining Transformers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fail to capture the coarse-to-fine temporal dynamics of EEG signals. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EEG-Deformer, which incorporates two main novel components into a CNN-Transformer: (1) a Hierarchical Coarse-to-Fine Transformer (HCT) block that integrates a Fine-grained Temporal Learning (FTL) branch into Transformers, effectively discerning coarse-to-fine temporal patterns; and (2) a Dense Information Purification (DIP) module, which utilizes multi-level, purified temporal information to enhance decoding accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on three representative cognitive tasks-cognitive attention, driving fatigue, and mental workload detection-consistently confirm the generalizability of our proposed EEG-Deformer, demonstrating that it either outperforms or performs comparably to existing state-of-the-art methods. Visualization results show that EEG-Deformer learns from neurophysiologically meaningful brain regions for the corresponding cognitive tasks.

      <title>Dynamical Embedding of Single Channel Electroencephalogram for Artifact Subspace Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework to apply Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm on single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. ASR, renowned for its automated capability to effectively eliminate various artifacts like eye-blinks and eye movements from EEG signals. Importantly it has been implemented on android smartphones, but relied on multiple channels for principal component subspace calculations. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate the established dynamical embedding approach into the algorithm, naming it Embedded-ASR (E-ASR). In our proposed method, an embedded matrix is first constructed from a single-channel EEG data using series of delay vectors. ASR is then applied to this embedded matrix, and the resulting cleaned single-channel EEG is reconstructed by removing the time lag and concatenating the rows of the embedded matrix. Data was collected from four subjects in resting states with eyes open from pre-frontal (Fp1 and Fp2) electrodes using CameraEEG app. To assess the effectiveness of the E-ASR algorithm on an EEG dataset with artifacts, we employed performance metrics such as relative root mean square error (RRMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), average power ratio as well as estimated the number of eye-blinks with and without the E-ASR approach. E-ASR was able to reduce artifacts from the semi-simulated EEG data, with an RRMSE of 45.45% and a CC of 0.91. For real EEG data, the counted eye-blinks were manually cross-checked with ground truth obtained from CameraEEG video data across all subjects for individual Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes. In conclusion, our study suggests E-ASR framework can remove artifacts from single channel EEG data. This promising algorithm might have potential for smartphone-based natural environment EEG applications, where minimal number of electrodes is a critical factor.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel single-channel decomposition approach to facilitate the decomposition of electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded with limited channels. Our model posits that an EEG signal comprises short, shift-invariant waves, referred to as atoms. We design a decomposer as an artificial neural network aimed at estimating these atoms and detecting their time shifts and amplitude modulations within the input signal. The efficacy of our method was validated across various scenarios in brain--computer interfaces and neuroscience, demonstrating enhanced performance. Additionally, cross-dataset validation indicates the feasibility of a pre-trained model, enabling a plug-and-play signal decomposition module.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Latency-Rate Tradeoff in Low-Latency Communications with Finite-Blocklength Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency communication plays an increasingly important role in delay-sensitive applications by ensuring the real-time information exchange. However, due to the constraint on the maximum instantaneous power, guaranteeing bounded latency is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the reliability-latency-rate tradeoff in low-latency communication systems with finite-blocklength coding (FBC). Specifically, we are interested in the fundamental tradeoff between error probability, delay-violation probability (DVP), and service rate. Based on the effective capacity (EC), we present the gain-conservation equations to characterize the reliability-latency-rate tradeoffs in low-latency communication systems. In particular, we investigate the low-latency transmissions over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a Nakagami-$m$ fading channel. By defining the service rate gain, reliability gain, and real-time gain, we conduct an asymptotic analysis to reveal the fundamental reliability-latency-rate tradeoff of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. To analytically evaluate and optimize the quality-of-service-constrained throughput of low-latency communication systems adopting FBC, an EC-approximation method is conceived to derive the closed-form expression of that throughput. Our results may offer some insights into the efficient scheduling of low-latency wireless communications, in which statistical latency and reliability metrics are crucial.</description>

      <title>A Spatial-Spectral and Temporal Dual Prototype Network for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) decoding plays a crucial role in developing motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs). However, decoding intentions from MI remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of EEG signals relative to the small-sample size. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-spectral and temporal dual prototype network (SST-DPN). First, we design a lightweight attention mechanism to uniformly model the spatial-spectral relationships across multiple EEG electrodes, enabling the extraction of powerful spatial-spectral features. Then, we develop a multi-scale variance pooling module tailored for EEG signals to capture long-term temporal features. This module is parameter-free and computationally efficient, offering clear advantages over the widely used transformer models. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototype learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets. Our experimental results show that the SST-DPN outperforms state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy (84.11% for dataset BCI4-2A, 86.65% for dataset BCI4-2B). Additionally, we use the BCI3-4A dataset with fewer training data to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed SST-DPN. We also achieve superior performance with 82.03% classification accuracy. Benefiting from the lightweight parameters and superior decoding accuracy, our SST-DPN shows great potential for practical MI-BCI applications. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hancan16/SST-DPN.</description>

      <title>An optimal pairwise merge algorithm improves the quality and consistency of nonnegative matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a key technique for feature extraction and widely used in source separation. However, existing algorithms may converge to poor local minima, or to one of several minima with similar objective value but differing feature parametrizations. Here we show that some of these weaknesses may be mitigated by performing NMF in a higher-dimensional feature space and then iteratively combining components with an analytically-solvable pairwise merge strategy. Experimental results demonstrate our method helps non-ideal NMF solutions escape to better local optima and achieve greater consistency of the solutions. Despite these extra steps, our approach exhibits similar computational performance to established methods by reducing the occurrence of "plateau phenomenon" near saddle points. Moreover, the results also illustrate that our method is compatible with different NMF algorithms. Thus, this can be recommended as a preferred approach for most applications of NMF.</description>

      <title>Integration of Communication and Computational Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication enables the expansion of human visual perception beyond the limitations of time and distance, while computational imaging overcomes the constraints of depth and breadth. Although impressive achievements have been witnessed with the two types of technologies, the occlusive information flow between the two domains is a bottleneck hindering their ulterior progression. Herein, we propose a novel framework that integrates communication and computational imaging (ICCI) to break through the inherent isolation between communication and computational imaging for remote perception. By jointly considering the sensing and transmitting of remote visual information, the ICCI framework performs a full-link information transfer optimization, aiming to minimize information loss from the generation of the information source to the execution of the final vision tasks. We conduct numerical analysis and experiments to demonstrate the ICCI framework by integrating communication systems and snapshot compressive imaging systems. Compared with straightforward combination schemes, which sequentially execute sensing and transmitting, the ICCI scheme shows greater robustness against channel noise and impairments while achieving higher data compression. Moreover, an 80 km 27-band hyperspectral video perception with a rate of 30 fps is experimentally achieved. This new ICCI remote perception paradigm offers a highefficiency solution for various real-time computer vision tasks.</description>
