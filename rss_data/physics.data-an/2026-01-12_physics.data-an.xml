      <title>Rotational Kinematics in the Globular Cluster System of M31: Insights from Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As ancient stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) offer valuable insights into the dynamical histories of large galaxies. Previous studies of GC populations in the inner and outer regions of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) have revealed intriguing subpopulations with distinct kinematic properties. Here, we build upon earlier studies by employing Bayesian modelling to investigate the kinematics of the combined inner and outer GC populations of M31. Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Probe Microscopy with Robust Bag-of-Features Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization: Pareto-Front Mapping of Nanoscale Structure-Property Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial materials libraries are an efficient route to generate large families of candidate compositions, but their impact is often limited by the speed and depth of characterization and by the difficulty of extracting actionable structure-property relations from complex characterization data. Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid "ground truth" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Foundation models for high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of foundation models -- large, pretrained machine learning models that can be finetuned to a variety of tasks -- has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. In high-energy physics, the question of whether these models can be implemented directly in physics research, or even built from scratch, tailored for particle physics data, has generated an increasing amount of attention. This review, which is the first on the topic of foundation models in high-energy physics, summarizes and discusses the research that has been published in the field so far.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical phenomena have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally in many fields, such as condensed matter physics, biology, e.g., brain criticality, and cosmology. In particular, the behaviour of response functions right at critical points (CPs) is highly topical. It turns out that in the frame of Boltzmann-Gibbs-von Neumann-Shannon approach, the extensive character of entropy breaks down at CPs. The latter implies diverging susceptibilities, which is at odds with experimental observations. Here, we investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ right at CPs for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i}$) for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii}$) the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii}$) the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv}$) we propose an experimental setup to explore finite-size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_{q}$ and $S_q$.</description>
