      <title>Strong-coupling theory of bilayer plasmon excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently plasmon excitations in bilayer lattice systems were studied extensively in the weak-coupling regime. Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $\omega_{\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $\omega_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.</description>

      <title>Hund-projected Kanamori model: an effective description of Hund's metals near the Mott insulating regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hund's coupling plays a decisive role in shaping electron correlations of multi-orbital systems, giving rise to a class of materials--Hund's metals--that combine local-moment physics with metallic transport. Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals.</description>

      <title>Defect Bootstrap: Tight Ground State Bounds in Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Anomalous Nernst Effect in SrRuO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anomalous Nernst effect in epitaxial SrRuO$_3$ thin films grown on c-cut Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates, and in a polycrystalline SrRuO$_3$ slab. Through comprehensive measurements of the transverse thermoelectric response as a function of temperature and magnetic field, we observe a pronounced Nernst signal near $T_c$ in the (111) oriented SrRuO$_3$ thin films. The strong temperature and nontrivial field dependence underscore the pivotal role of the magnetic anisotropy in tuning the Berry curvature and, consequently, the anomalous Nernst effect in SrRuO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Probing magnetic-field-induced multipolar ordering through field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal expansion in PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal-expansion measurements on PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, a cubic non-Kramers compound exhibiting antiferroquadrupolar order below $T_{\rm Q}=0.125$ K. Thermal expansion exhibits two qualitatively different anomalies under magnetic fields applied along the $[001]$ direction, providing experimental support for the existence of an intermediate A phase previously reported. Furthermore, comparison between the experimental results and theoretical modeling indicates a strong anisotropic coupling of the $O_{20}$ quadrupolar moment, which plays a key role in stabilizing the A phase. These findings demonstrate that multipolar states in non-Kramers systems can be effectively tuned by magnetic-field orientation, providing insights into the anisotropic nature of quadrupolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Helical Quasiperiodic Chains with Engineered Dissipation: Liouvillian Rapidity Diagnostics of Transport and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relaxation spectra of a quadratic spinless--fermion helical chain with an Aubry--Andre--type quasiperiodic potential and a single N--th neighbor (helical) hopping. Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization. Our results highlight Liouvillian rapidities as compact, experimentally relevant diagnostics of relaxation and sensitivity in engineered open quantum lattices.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetism and Kekul\'e valence bond order in the honeycomb optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise role of e-ph coupling in graphene and related materials on a honeycomb lattice is not yet fully understood, despite extensive research on these systems. Here, we perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (oSSH)-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, focusing on the parameters relevant to graphene. Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekul\'e Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary. Notably, we predict that increasing either the on-site Hubbard repulsion or the e-ph coupling strength drives graphene toward the KVBS phase rather than the AFM phase, highlighting a synergistic effect that can be exploited to further control the remarkable properties of graphene and related materials.</description>

      <title>Charge carrier relaxation dynamics in the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic question in the field of ultrafast dynamics is concerned with the relaxation dynamics and the subsequent thermalization of optically excited charge carriers. Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.</description>

      <title>Saturation Field as a Direct Probe of Exchange and Single-Ion Anisotropies in Spin-1 Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High magnetic fields provide a direct route to probe the anisotropies that govern spin dynamics in layered magnets. Using the SU(3) bond operator framework for spin 1 systems, we derive analytic expressions for the magnon spectrum and the critical fields delimiting the field induced ordered phase. We show that the upper critical field $h_{c2}$ carries a simple and quantitative fingerprint of both exchange anisotropy and single ion symmetry breaking, enabling high field experiments to serve as sensitive probes of microscopic anisotropy. We further map how these anisotropies, together with interlayer coupling, control the extent and location of the magnon Bose Einstein condensation dome. Our results provide experimentally accessible criteria for identifying symmetry breaking mechanisms in real spin 1 materials.</description>

      <title>Unconventional orders in the maple-leaf ferro-antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets, we present a multi-method investigation into the nature of the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice with three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor interactions. It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Modelling of Moir\'e Materials: A User's Guide with Selected Applications to Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the theoretical modelling of moir\'e materials, focusing on various aspects of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-TBG) viewed through the lens of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moir\'e bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized "chiral-flat" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moir\'e superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ans\"atze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first "case study". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Field Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS) are a powerful variational ansatz for quantum field theories of a single field. However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Asymmetric Pseudogap below T$_\text{c}$ in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To this day, high-temperature cuprate superconductors remain an unparalleled platform for studying the competition and coexistence of emergent, static and dynamic, quantum phases of matter exhibiting high transition temperature non-s-wave superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid transport and a still enigmatic pseudogap regime. However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity of Supersymmetric SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on Krylov complexity in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model under irrelevant and mass deformations of the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant deformation breaks $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry down to $\mathcal{N}=1$, while the mass deformation breaks supersymmetry completely. Using Krylov subspace methods, we analyze the Lanczos sequence, Krylov dimension, complexity, and entropy at finite system size as functions of deformation strength. Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation has a stronger effect. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Tetragonal Phase and Aluminum-Doping Effect in a Bilayer Nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the tetragonal phase of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is stabilized under high pressures, is responsible for high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure. X-ray and neutron diffractions verify the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure for the post-annealed samples La$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_x$O$_{7-\delta}$ (0.3 $\leq x \leq$ 0.5). The Al-doped samples, including the tetragonal ones, show semiconducting properties, carry localized magnetic moments, and exhibit spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures, all of which can be explained in terms of charge carrier localization. Furthermore, high-pressure resistance measurements on post-annealed samples reveal that even a low Al doping ($x$ = 0.05) suppresses superconductivity almost completely. This work gives information about the effect of nonmagnetic impurity on metallicity as well as superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, which would contribute to understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates.</description>

      <title>Dichroism from Thermoelectric Chiral Drives: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of UTe$_2$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on UTe$_2$ under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P &lt; 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high pressure region $P &gt; 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, the underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial stresses based on the density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find a significant pressure dependence for a certain Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears at the Fermi level. An increase in the density of states at the Fermi level is observed under pressure, which is attributed to compressive stress along the [010] crystallographic axis.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic imaginary-time evolution in state-vector-based and shot-based simulations and on quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Fractional Phases in Multi-Band Vortexable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study topological flat bands with distinct features that deviate from conventional Landau level behavior. We show that even in the ideal quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems, we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.</description>

      <title>From localized 4f electrons to anisotropic exchange interactions in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CeRh6Ge4 is a cerium-based ferromagnetic material exhibiting a quantum critical behavior under pressure. We derive effective exchange interactions, using the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along the c axis is isotropic in spin space, leading to a formation of spin chains. On the other hand, the inter-chain coupling is highly anisotropic: The in-plane moment weakly interacts ferromagnetically in the a--b plane to stabilize the ferromagnetic state, whereas the z-component couples antiferromagnetically, contributing to its destabilization. The magnetic anisotropy of the interchain interactions as well as of the local 4f wavefunctions characterizes the magnetic properties underlying the ferromagnetic transition and the quantum critical behavior in CeRh6Ge4.</description>

      <title>Universal Mott quantum criticality in a modified periodic Anderson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mott quantum criticality is a central theme in correlated electron physics, observed in systems featuring both continuous zero-temperature transitions and those with finite-temperature critical endpoints. Within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature. Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\text{met}} = 0.76$ and $z_{\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively. These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust $\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally, we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr-effect measurements under pulsed magnetic fields over 40 T using a compact sample fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials science. A pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noise originating from field pulses. The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the change in the state of light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has the potential to become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed fields. Nevertheless, since the MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE signals from various ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, significantly extending the limits of previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate material properties in pulsed fields.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ clock model: Enhanced symmetries, emergent orders, and Landau-incompatible transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ classical $q$-state clock model with even $q&gt;4$ on a two-dimensional square lattice, revealing a rich ensemble of phases driven by competing interactions. In the unfrustrated regime ($J_1&gt;2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model phenomenology: a low-temperature $\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an intermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1&lt;2J_2$, frustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a stripe-ordered phase breaking $\mathbb{Z}_q\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two $\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an exotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of freedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly forbidden $\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared long-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation, highlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner transfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical Monte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional Landau-incompatible transitions between different phases. Finally, we propose an effective field-theoretic framework that encompasses these emergent orders and their interwoven transitions.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory</title>

Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We obtain a remarkable agreement with experimental data for an aluminium nitride monocrystal, which strongly suggests the use of spinDMFT as a prediction tool. Furthermore, we draw a comparison between a quantum-mechanical and a classical version of spinDMFT showing that local quantum effects are of great importance for the studied type of system.</description>

      <title>Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)</title>

Abstract: Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.</description>
