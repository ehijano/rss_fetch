      <title>Identification and Estimation of Continuous-Time Dynamic Discrete Choice Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the theoretical, computational, and econometric properties of continuous time dynamic discrete choice games with stochastically sequential moves, introduced by Arcidiacono, Bayer, Blevins, and Ellickson (2016). We consider identification of the rate of move arrivals, which was assumed to be known in previous work, as well as a generalized version with heterogeneous move arrival rates. We re-establish conditions for existence of a Markov perfect equilibrium in the generalized model and consider identification of the model primitives with only discrete time data sampled at fixed intervals. Three foundational example models are considered: a single agent renewal model, a dynamic entry and exit model, and a quality ladder model. Through these examples we examine the computational and statistical properties of estimators via Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical example using data from Rust (1987). The experiments show how parameter estimates behave when moving from continuous time data to discrete time data of decreasing frequency and the computational feasibility as the number of firms grows. The empirical example highlights the impact of allowing decision rates to vary.</description>

      <title>Peer effect analysis with latent processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study peer effects that arise from irreversible decisions in the absence of a standard social equilibrium. I model a latent sequence of decisions in continuous time and obtain a closed-form expression for the likelihood, which allows to estimate proposed causal estimands. The method avoids regression on conditional expectations or linear-in-means regression -- and thus reflection-type problems (Manski, 1993) or simultaneity issues -- by modeling the (unobserved) realized direction of causality, whose probability is identified. Under a parsimonious parametric specification, I introduce a peer effect parameter meant to capture the causal influence of first-movers on their peers. Various forms of peer effect heterogeneity can be accommodated. Parameters are shown to be consistently estimated by maximum likelihood methods and lend themselves to standard inference.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Statistics for Markovian Feedback Processes and Unobserved Heterogeneity in Dynamic Panel Logit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine identification in a dynamic panel logit model with state dependence, first-order Markov feedback processes, and individual unobserved heterogeneity by introducing sufficient statistics for the feedback process and unobserved heterogeneity. If a sequentially exogenous discrete covariate follows a first-order Markov process, identification of the coefficient on the covariate via conditional likelihood is infeasible, whereas identification of the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is feasible when there are at least three periods after the initial-condition period. If the feedback depends only on the lagged dependent variable, the coefficient on the covariate is identified with at least two periods, and the coefficient on the lagged dependent variable is identified with at least three periods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Index Forecast with Tensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider diffusion index forecast with both tensor and non-tensor predictors, where the tensor structure is preserved with a Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor factor model. When the number of non-tensor predictors is small, we study the asymptotic properties of the least-squared estimator in this tensor factor-augmented regression, allowing for factors with different strengths. We derive an analytical formula for prediction intervals that accounts for the estimation uncertainty of the latent factors. In addition, we propose a novel thresholding estimator for the high-dimensional covariance matrix that is robust to cross-sectional dependence. When the number of non-tensor predictors exceeds or diverges with the sample size, we introduce a multi-source factor-augmented sparse regression model and establish the consistency of the corresponding penalized estimator. Simulation studies validate our theoretical results and an empirical application to US trade flows demonstrates the advantages of our approach over other popular methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of high-dimensional spot volatility matrix with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In random matrix theory, the spectral distribution of the covariance matrix has been well studied under the large dimensional asymptotic regime when the dimensionality and the sample size tend to infinity at the same rate. However, most existing theories are built upon the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples, which may be violated in practice. For example, the observational data of continuous-time processes at discrete time points, namely, the high-frequency data. In this paper, we extend the classical spectral analysis for the covariance matrix in large dimensional random matrix to the spot volatility matrix by using the high-frequency data. We establish the first-order limiting spectral distribution and obtain a second-order result, that is, the central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics. Moreover, we apply the results to design some feasible tests for the spot volatility matrix, including the identity and sphericity tests. Simulation studies justify the finite sample performance of the test statistics and verify our established theory.</description>

      <title>The Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Long-Term Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we exhaust methods that reduces variance without introducing bias, reducing variance in experiments often requires accepting some bias, using methods like winsorization or surrogate metrics. While this bias-variance tradeoff can be optimized for individual experiments, bias may accumulate over time, raising concerns for long-term optimization. We analyze whether bias is ever acceptable when it can accumulate, and show that a bias-variance tradeoff persists in long-term settings. Improving signal-to-noise remains beneficial, even if it introduces bias. This implies we should shift from thinking there is a single ``correct'', unbiased metric to thinking about how to make the best estimates and decisions when better precision can be achieved at the expense of bias.
  Furthermore, our model adds nuance to previous findings that suggest less stringent launch criterion leads to improved gains. We show while this is beneficial when the system is far from the optimum, more stringent launch criterion is preferable as the system matures.</description>

      <title>New Tests of Equal Forecast Accuracy for Factor-Augmented Regressions with Weaker Loadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20415v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the theoretical foundation for the recent tests of equal forecast accuracy and encompassing by Pitarakis (2023) and Pitarakis (2025), when the competing forecast specification is that of a factor-augmented regression model. This should be of interest for practitioners, as there is no theory justifying the use of these simple and powerful tests in such context. In pursuit of this, we employ a novel theory to incorporate the empirically well-documented fact of homogeneously/heterogeneously weak factor loadings, and track their effect on the forecast comparison problem.</description>
