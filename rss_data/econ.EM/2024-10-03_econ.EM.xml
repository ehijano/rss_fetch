      <title>Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Using a Conditional Moment Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new estimator for heterogeneous treatment effects in a partially linear model (PLM) with multiple exogenous covariates and a potentially endogenous treatment variable. Our approach integrates a Robinson transformation to handle the nonparametric component, the Smooth Minimum Distance (SMD) method to leverage conditional mean independence restrictions, and a Neyman-Orthogonalized first-order condition (FOC). By employing regularized model selection techniques like the Lasso method, our estimator accommodates numerous covariates while exhibiting reduced bias, consistency, and asymptotic normality. Simulations demonstrate its robust performance with diverse instrument sets compared to traditional GMM-type estimators. Applying this method to estimate Medicaid's heterogeneous treatment effects from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment reveals more robust and reliable results than conventional GMM approaches.</description>

      <title>Local Projections Inference with High-Dimensional Covariates without Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive local projections (LP) framework for estimating future responses to current shocks, robust to high-dimensional controls without relying on sparsity assumptions. The approach is applicable to various settings, including impulse response analysis and difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation. While methods like LASSO exist, they often assume most parameters are exactly zero, limiting their effectiveness in dense data generation processes. I propose a novel technique incorporating high-dimensional covariates in local projections using the Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm with a high-dimensional AIC (OGA+HDAIC) model selection method. This approach offers robustness in both sparse and dense scenarios, improved interpretability, and more reliable causal inference in local projections. Simulation studies show superior performance in dense and persistent scenarios compared to conventional LP and LASSO-based approaches. In an empirical application to Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2019), I demonstrate efficiency gains and robustness to a large set of controls. Additionally, I examine the effect of subjective beliefs on economic aggregates, demonstrating robustness to various model specifications. A novel state-dependent analysis reveals that inflation behaves more in line with rational expectations in good states, but exhibits more subjective, pessimistic dynamics in bad states.</description>

      <title>Partially Identified Heterogeneous Treatment Effect with Selection: An Application to Gender Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the sample selection model within the context of the gender gap problem, where even random treatment assignment is affected by selection bias. By offering a robust alternative free from distributional or specification assumptions, we bound the treatment effect under the sample selection model with an exclusion restriction, an assumption whose validity is tested in the literature. This exclusion restriction allows for further segmentation of the population into distinct types based on observed and unobserved characteristics. For each type, we derive the proportions and bound the gender gap accordingly. Notably, trends in type proportions and gender gap bounds reveal an increasing proportion of always-working individuals over time, alongside variations in bounds, including a general decline across time and consistently higher bounds for those in high-potential wage groups. Further analysis, considering additional assumptions, highlights persistent gender gaps for some types, while other types exhibit differing or inconclusive trends. This underscores the necessity of separating individuals by type to understand the heterogeneous nature of the gender gap.</description>
