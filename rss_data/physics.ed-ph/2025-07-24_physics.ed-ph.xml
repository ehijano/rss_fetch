      <title>Pictorial and Documentary Guide for Research, Teaching, and Education through Astronomy, Physics, and Mathematics Pursued under the Umbrella of the United Nations (1974-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper was prepared for Open-Access-only publication as a guide reporting on Education (all aspects of space science and technology), Teaching (remote sensing and GIS, satellite meteorology and global climate, satellite communication, space and atmospheric sciences, global navigation satellite systems), and Research (solar neutrino problem, formation of structure in the Universe) in astronomy (solar physics, cosmology), physics (nuclear physics, neutrino physics), and mathematics (fractional calculus, special functions of mathematical physics) exercised over 50 years (1974-2024). In this period, more than twenty workshops were held and seven regional centres for space science and technology education were established in all regions of the world: Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Western Asia, and Europe. This effort was undertaken in cooperation with ESA, NASA, JAXA, and 193 member states of the United Nations under the auspices of the UN, also supported by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) and the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The paper provides access to most of the documents in the six official languages of the United Nations (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish), proceedings, and published papers and books focusing on education, teaching, and research (listed in Google Scholar and Research Gate).</description>

      <title>Einstein's elevator and the principle of equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline here the design, execution, and educational outcomes of an intervention inspired by Einstein's elevator thought experiment, intended to introduce secondary school students to the principle of equivalence, which is at the basis of the theory of General Relativity. We build an experimental version of Einstein's elevator, which simulated the effects of free-fall in an accelerated reference frame: a detailed description of the experimental apparatus and its construction is provided, highlighting the challenges and innovations in creating a simple yet functional setup using everyday materials.</description>
