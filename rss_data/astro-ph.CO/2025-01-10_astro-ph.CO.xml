      <title>Lyman Alpha Forest - Halo Cross-Correlations in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a perturbative effective field theory (EFT) description for anisotropic (redshift-space) correlations between the Lyman alpha forest and a generic biased tracer of matter, which could be represented by quasars, high-redshift galaxies, or dark matter halos. We compute one-loop EFT power spectrum predictions for the combined analysis of the Lyman alpha and biased tracers' data and test them on the publicly available high fidelity Sherwood simulations. We use massive and light dark matter halos at redshift $z=2.8$ as proxies for quasars and high-redshift galaxies, respectively. In both cases, we demonstrate that our EFT model can consistently describe the complete data vector consisting of the Lyman alpha forest auto spectrum, the halo auto spectrum, and the Lyman alpha -- halo cross spectrum. We show that the addition of cross-correlations significantly sharpens constraints on EFT parameters of the Lyman alpha forest and halos. In the combined analysis, our EFT model fits the simulated cross-spectra with a percent level accuracy at $k_{\rm max}= 1~h$Mpc$^{-1}$, which represents a significant improvement over previous analytical models. Thus, our work provides precision theoretical tools for full-shape analyses of Lyman alpha - quasar cross-correlations with ongoing and upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Approximating non-Gaussian Bayesian partitions with normalising flows: statistics, inference and application to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject of this paper is the simplification of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as used in Bayesian statistical inference by means of normalising flows, a machine learning method which is able to construct an invertible and differentiable transformation between Gaussian and non-Gaussian random distributions. We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.</description>

      <title>Influence of photometric galaxies redshift distribution in BAO estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric surveys are good solutions for large-scale structure studies. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) benefit from photometric redshift survey observations due to faster coverage and a higher number of observed objects. In the present study, we use the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) to use the realistic galaxies' Probability Distribution Function (PDF) that describes each galaxy redshift to select samples and include in the fitting model as the input for the redshift uncertainty. We used four different photo-z estimators \texttt{ANNz2}, \texttt{BPZ}, \texttt{ENF}, and \texttt{DNF} to compare how they affect the BAO feature constraint, the catalogs called \texttt{Pz Cats}. Furthermore, for each algorithm, we selected two different samples according to the PDFs shape, one where the PDFs are nearly Gaussian and the other that chooses the least noisy PDFs in which the PDFs have one pronounced peak. We computed the correlation function $\xi_\perp(z_p)$ by getting the bin pairs transversal to each other using \texttt{CAMB}. The kernel window function is the $f(z|z_p)$ which is the selection of the PDF value when the photometric redshift is nearly the same as the spectroscopic redshift estimated by the matched spectroscopic sample. For compatible $z_{eff}$, We concluded that the shape of the galaxy redshift PDF could shift the BAO feature position either by including the PDF in the model or not We also learnt that, given the same spectroscopic sample, \texttt{ANNz2} is the best photo-z estimator for BAO analysis considering the realistic full probability distribution function of each galaxy.</description>

      <title>The impact of the redshift-dependent selection effect of halos on the redshift-space power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a wide-area spectroscopic survey of galaxies, it is nearly impossible to obtain a homogeneous sample of galaxies with respect to galaxy properties such as stellar mass and host halo mass across a range of redshifts. Despite the selection effect, theoretical templates in most analyses assume single tracers when compared with the measured clustering quantities. We demonstrate analytically that the selection effect inevitably introduces a bias in the redshift-space power spectrum on scales from linear to nonlinear scales. To quantitatively assess the impact of the selection effect, we construct mock galaxy catalogs from halos in N-body simulations by selecting halos above redshift-dependent mass thresholds such that the resulting redshift distribution of the halos, $n(z)$, matches that of SDSS-like galaxies. We find that the selection effect causes fractional changes of up to only 1% and 2% in the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space power spectrum at $k\lesssim 0.3~h{\rm{Mpc}}^{-1}$, respectively, compared to the moments for the single mass-threshold (therefore single tracer) sample, for $n_{\rm g}(z)$ of the SDSS-like galaxy samples. We also argue that the selection effect is unlikely to cause a significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters using the Fisher matrix method, provided that the redshift-dependent selection effect is modest.</description>

      <title>Bayesian correction of $H(z)$ cosmic chronometers data with systematic errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the 32 $H(z)$ data from cosmic chronometers have overestimated uncertainties and make use of a Bayesian method to correct and reduce it. We then use the corrected data to constrain flat $\Lambda$CDM and O$\Lambda$CDM parameters. For the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we got as result $H_{0} = 67.1\pm 4.0$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega _{m} = 0.333 ^{+0.041}_{-0.057}$. While for the O$\Lambda$CDM model, we found $H_{0} = 67.2\pm 4.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega _{m} = 0.36\pm 0.16$ and $\Omega _{\Lambda} =0.71 ^{+0.36}_{-0.28}$. These results goes from $22\%$ up to $28\%$ uncertainty reduction when compared to the constraints of the both uncorrected models.</description>

      <title>Harvesting primordial black holes from stochastic trees with $\texttt{FOREST}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on stochastic trees, modelling the inflationary expansion as a branching process. Combined with the $\delta N$ formalism, this allows us to generate real-space maps of the curvature perturbation that fully capture quantum diffusion and its non-perturbative backreaction during inflation. Unlike lattice methods, trees do not proceed on a fixed background since new spacetime units emerge dynamically as trees unfold, naturally incorporating metric fluctuations. The recursive structure of stochastic trees also offers remarkable numerical efficiency, and we develop the FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool and demonstrate its performance. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees, and how their mass distribution can be obtained while automatically accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" effect. In the "quantum-well" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature and discuss several prospects.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum of matter number counts in cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure (LSS), offering insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we derive the theoretical angular bispectrum of number counts for the first time without relying on the Limber approximation, while incorporating redshift binning. Notably, our analysis includes all Newtonian effects, leading relativistic projection effects, and general relativistic contributions, including radiation dynamics, up to second order in perturbation theory. For simplicity, however, we neglect any biasing effects. We have implemented these expressions in an open access code to evaluate the bispectrum for two redshift bins, $z=2 \pm 0.25$ and $z=0.6 \pm 0.05$, and compare our analytical results with simulations. For the contributions that already appear in a Newtonian treatment we find an interesting cancellation between the quadratic terms. At $z=2$, the projection effects and the dynamical effects have similar amplitude on large scales as we approach $k \sim \mathcal{H}$. In the squeezed limit, radiation effects are found to be the leading relativistic effects, by one order of magnitude. At $z=0.6$, we find the correct weak-field hierarchy between the terms, controlled by the ratio $\mathcal{H}/k$, but we still find that dynamical effects (from nonlinear evolution) are only a factor $2-3$ smaller than the projection effects. We compare our results with simulation measurements and find good agreement for the total bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Cosmic deceptions due to peculiar motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative motions have long been known to mislead the unsuspecting observers to false interpretations of reality. The deceptions are usually brief and unimportant, though relative motions have also led to illusions that were both long-lasting and important. Indeed, in the history of astronomy there are several examples where relative-motion effects have misled us to gross misinterpretations. Here, we consider the possibility that our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest-frame can trigger deceptions on cosmological scales. In so doing, we will demonstrate that unsuspecting observers inside bulk peculiar flows may come to the false conclusion of recent accelerated expansion, when their host universe is actually decelerating. The same observers may then erroneously attribute their apparent acceleration to an also recent dramatic change in the nature of the cosmic medium. In reality, however, nothing has really happened. Despite the appearances, the host universe keeps decelerating and its material content retains its conventional form. Nevertheless, there are ways out of these illusions. Our observers can find out that they have been deceived by their own peculiar flow, by looking for the trademark signature of relative motion in their data. This signature is nothing else but a Doppler-like anisotropy in the sky distribution of the measured deceleration parameter. To the bulk-flow observers, the universe should appear to accelerate faster along a certain point on the celestial sphere and equally slower along the antipodal. Moreover, the magnitude of the apparent dipole should decrease with increasing redshift.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Ultraviolet Freeze-in in General Reheating Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of cosmic reheating, that is, on how the energy stored in the inflaton is transferred to the standard model (SM) thermal bath, is largely unknown. In this work, we show that the phenomenology of the nonbaryonic dark matter (DM) ultraviolet freeze-in production strongly depends on the dynamics of the cosmic-reheating era. Using a general parametrization for the Hubble expansion rate and SM temperature, we thoroughly investigate DM production during reheating, not only recovering earlier findings that focused on specific cases, but also exploring alternative scenarios. Additionally, we derive a generalized framework for DM production via inflaton decays and identify the viable parameter space, while simultaneously addressing constraints from CMB observations. As illustrative examples, we explore gravitational DM production through scatterings of SM particles or inflatons, deriving well-defined parameter regions for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Half-Mass Radii and Color Gradients for Young and Old Quiescent Galaxies at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3$ with JWST/PRIMER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between $0.5&lt;z&lt;3,$ tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey. Half-light radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455 quiescent galaxies with log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$&gt;10$, whereas half-mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the F277W-F444W color-$M_*$/L relation. We investigate the dependence of the ratio $r_{e, \mathrm{mass}}/r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$ on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength used to measure $r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$, also separating the sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies. Our data demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical wavelengths (0.5-0.7$\mu$m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only minor variations in redshift. We find that the average size of young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent galaxies at intermediate masses, $10&lt;$log($M_*/M_{\odot}$)$&lt;11$, within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius measurements. At face value, our results point to a combination of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at $0.5&lt;z&lt;3$. Our results further indicate that the varying contributions to the general quiescent population by young and old quiescent galaxies can mimic evolution in redshift.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Search for Optical Emission Lines from Dark Matter Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for narrow-line optical emission from dark matter decay by stacking dark-sky spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the redshift of nearby galaxies from DESI's Bright Galaxy and Luminous Red Galaxy samples. Our search uses regions separated by 5 to 20 arcsecond from the centers of the galaxies, corresponding to an impact parameter of approximately $50\,\rm kpc$. No unidentified spectral line shows up in the search, and we place a line flux limit of $10^{-19}\,\rm{ergs}/\rm{s}/\rm{cm}^{2}/\rm{arcsec}^{2}$ on emissions in the wavelength range of $2000$ -- $9000 \,\mathring{\rm A}$. This places the tightest constraints yet on the two-photon decay of dark matter in the mass range of 5 to $12\,\rm eV$, with a particle lifetime exceeding $3\times 10^{25}\,\rm s$. This detection limit also implies that the line surface brightness contributed from all dark matter along the line of sight is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the measured extragalactic background light (EBL), ruling out the possibility that narrow optical-line emission from dark matter decay is a major source of the EBL.</description>

      <title>HOD-Dependent Systematics for Luminous Red Galaxies in the DESI 2024 BAO Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the estimation of systematics related to the halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling in the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) distance measurement of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 analysis. This paper focuses on the study of HOD systematics for luminous red galaxies (LRG). We consider three different HOD models for LRGs, including the base 5-parameter vanilla model and two extensions to it, that we refer to as baseline and extended models. The baseline model is described by the 5 vanilla HOD parameters, an incompleteness factor and a velocity bias parameter, whereas the extended one also includes a galaxy assembly bias and a satellite profile parameter. We utilize the 25 dark matter simulations available in the AbacusSummit simulation suite at $z=$ 0.8 and generate mock catalogs for our different HOD models. To test the impact of the HOD modeling in the position of the BAO peak, we run BAO fits for all these sets of simulations and compare the best-fit BAO-scaling parameters $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ and $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ between every pair of HOD models. We do this for both Fourier and configuration spaces independently, using post-reconstruction measurements. We find a 3.3$\sigma$ detection of HOD systematic for $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ in configuration space with an amplitude of 0.19%. For the other cases, we did not find a 3$\sigma$ detection, and we decided to compute a conservative estimation of the systematic using the ensemble of shifts between all pairs of HOD models. By doing this, we quote a systematic with an amplitude of 0.07% in $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ for both Fourier and configuration spaces; and of 0.09% in $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ for Fourier space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the dynamical evolution of the dark matter's relaxation response to galaxies and their connection to the astrophysical properties as simulated in the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that the radially-dependent linear relaxation relation model from our previous work is applicable at least from redshift $z=5$. We focus on the offset parameter $q_0$, which characterizes the relaxation of dark matter shells without changing the enclosed mass. We perform multiple time-series analyses to determine the possible causal connections between the relaxation mechanism and astrophysical processes such as star formation and associated feedback processes, as well as feedback due to active galactic nuclei. We show that star formation activity significantly influences the halo relaxation response throughout its evolutionary history, with essentially immediate effects in the inner haloes and delayed effects of 2 to 3 Gyr in the outer regions. Metal content shows a weaker connection to relaxation than star formation rates, but the accumulated wind from feedback processes exhibits a stronger correlation. These findings enhance our understanding of halo relaxation mechanisms. Our estimates of the time-scales relevant for dark matter relaxation can potentially improve the description of halo profiles in existing baryonification schemes and semi-analytical galaxy formation models. Our results also show how the relaxation response of dark haloes can probe the evolutionary history of the galaxies they host.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This can be tested in future observatories, for example, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET via second-order GW signals. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we confront the bound on an ultraviolet cutoff (UV) of a quantum field theory (QFT) proposed by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN) with the latest results of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The former relates the UV cutoff with an infrared (IR) cutoff of the theory by excluding all states describing a black hole. Identifying now the IR cutoff with the Hubble horizon yields a time-varying contribution of the vacuum energy to the dark energy density of the universe. At the same time the DESI results in combination with other cosmological data point towards a preference of time-varying dark energy models over $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>A trailing lognormal approximation of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: comparison with full hydrodynamic simulations at $2.2\leq z\leq 2.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$(Ly$\alpha$) forest in the spectra of distant quasars encodes the information of the underlying cosmic density field at smallest scales. The modelling of the upcoming large and high-fidelity forest data using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations is computationally challenging and therefore, requires accurate semi-analytical techniques. One such approach is based on the assumption that baryonic density fields in the intergalactic medium (IGM) follow lognormal distribution. Keeping this in mind, we extend our earlier work to improve the lognormal model of the Ly$\alpha$ forest in recovering the parameters characterizing IGM state, particularly the hydrogen photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{12}$), between $2.2 \leq z \leq 2.7$, by simulating the model spectra at a slightly lower redshift than the Sherwood smooth particle hydrodynamical simulations (SPH) data. The recovery of thermal parameters, namely, the mean-density IGM temperature ($T_0$) and the slope of the temperature-density relation ($\gamma$) is also alleviated. These parameters are estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, using the mean and power spectrum of the transmitted flux. We find that the usual lognormal distribution of IGM densities tend to over-predict the number of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers seen in SPH simulation. A lognormal model simulated at a lower redshift than SPH data can address this limitation to a certain extent. We show that with such a "trailing" model of lognormal distribution, values of $\Gamma_{12}$ are recovered at $\lesssim 1-\sigma$. We argue that this model can be useful for constraining cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Superradiant growth anomaly magnification in evolution of vector bosonic condensates bounded by a Kerr black hole with near-horizon reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight vector particles can form evolving condensates around a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability. We study the effect of near-horizon reflection on the evolution of this system: by matching three pieces of asymptotic expansions of the Proca equation in Kerr metric and considering the leading order in the electric mode, we present explicit analytical expressions for the corrected spectrum and the superradiant instability rates. Particularly, in high-spin BH cases, we identify an anomalous situation where the superadiance rate is temporarily increased by the reflection parameter $\mathcal{R}$, which also occurs in the scalar scenario, but is largely magnified in vector condensates due to a faster growth rate in dominant mode. We point out the condition for the growth anomaly in the adiabatic case is that information carried per particle exceeds a certain value $\delta I/\delta N&gt;2\pi k_\text{B} \sqrt{(1+\mathcal{R})/(1-\mathcal{R})}$. We further construct several featured quantities to illustrate it, and formalize the anomaly-induced gravitational wave strain deformation.</description>

      <title>Probing charge of compact objects with gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves (GWs) opens up the exciting possibility of studying the spacetime geometry around the lens. In this work, we investigate the prospects of constraining the `charged' hair of a charged gravitating object from the observation of a GW signal microlensed by the same. The charge can have electromagnetic or modified gravity origin. We compute the analytic form of the lensing potential with charge and construct the lensed waveforms for a range of mass and charge of the charged object, assuming them to be non spinning. Using an approximate likelihood function, we explore how future observations of microlensed GWs can constrain the charge of the lens. We conclude that lensing observations are unlikely to be able to constrain the electromagnetic charge of black holes. However, we might be able to put modest constraints on certain modified gravity models (e.g., the brandworld scenario) or the possibility of the lenses being exotic objects (e.g., naked singularities) .</description>

      <title>Nonthermal Heavy Dark Matter from a First-Order Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonthermal production of heavy dark matter from the dynamics of the background scalar field during a first-order phase transition, predominantly from bubble collisions. In scenarios where bubble walls achieve runaway behavior and get boosted to very high energies, we find that it is possible to produce dark matter with mass several orders of magnitude above the symmetry breaking scale or the highest temperature ever reached by the thermal plasma. We also demonstrate that the existing formalism for calculating particle production from bubble dynamics in a first-order phase transition is not gauge invariant, and can lead to spurious results. While a rigorous and complete resolution of this problem is still lacking, we provide a practical prescription for the computation that avoids unphysical contributions and should provide reliable order-of-magnitude estimates of this effect. Furthermore, we point out the importance of three-body decays of the background field excitations into scalars and gauge bosons, which provide the dominant contributions at energy scales above the scale of symmetry breaking. Using our improved results, we find that scalar, fermion, and vector dark matter are all viable across a large range of mass scales, from O(10) TeV to a few orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, and the corresponding phase transitions can be probed with current and future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Delicate curvature bounces in the no-boundary wave function and in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed. Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources is presented. The low-energy asymptotic regime is extracted, requiring a self-consistent coupling of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The Raychaudhuri equation reduces to a balance equation, with two important limits. These limits can be interpreted empirically for rotationally supported configurations such as galaxies. The net energy including quasilocal kinetic contributions vanishes on the inner vortex surface, and the outer rotosurface. These new geometrical objects potentially shed light on virialization. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support previous suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies. The demonstration that general relativity possesses a new alternative low-energy limit different from the conventional post-Newtonian limit may have major consequences for all gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass. The issue of the gauge coupling unification is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ feedback prevails at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the first galaxies, stars, and star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation pressure from Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) scattering is a potentially dominant form of early stellar feedback, capable of injecting up to $\sim 100 \, \times$ more momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) than UV continuum radiation pressure and stellar winds. Ly$\alpha$ feedback is particularly strong in dust-poor environments and is thus especially important during the formation of the first stars and galaxies. As upcoming galaxy formation simulations incorporate Ly$\alpha$ feedback, it is crucial to consider processes that can limit it to avoid placing $\Lambda$CDM in apparent tension with recent \textit{JWST} observations indicating efficient star formation at Cosmic Dawn. We study Ly$\alpha$ feedback using a novel analytical Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer solution that includes the effects of continuum absorption, gas velocity gradients, Ly$\alpha$ destruction (e.g. by $2p \rightarrow 2s$ transitions), ISM turbulence, and atomic recoil. We verify our solution for uniform clouds using extensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) tests, and resolve a previous discrepancy between analytical and MCRT predictions. We then study the sensitivity of Ly$\alpha$ feedback to the aforementioned effects. While these can dampen Ly$\alpha$ feedback by a factor $\lesssim \textrm{few} \times 10$, we find it remains $\gtrsim 5 - 100 \, \times$ stronger than direct radiation pressure and therefore cannot be neglected. We provide an accurate fit for the Ly$\alpha$ force multiplier $M_{\rm F}$, suitable for implementation in subgrid models for galaxy formation simulations. Our findings highlight the critical role of Ly$\alpha$ feedback in regulating star formation at Cosmic Dawn, and underscore the necessity of incorporating it into simulations to accurately model early galaxy evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of understanding the Universe's dynamics, particularly the Hubble tension, requires precise measurements of the Hubble constant. Building upon the existing spectral-siren method, which capitalizes on population information from gravitational-wave sources, this paper explores an alternative way to analyze the population data to obtain the cosmological parameters in $\Lambda$CDM. We demonstrated how non-parametric methods, which are flexible models that can be used to agnostically reconstruct arbitrary probability densities, can be incorporated into this framework and leverage the detector-frame mass distribution to infer the cosmological parameters. We tested our method with mock data and applied it to $70$ binary black hole mergers from the third gravitational-wave transient catalog of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>

Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>
