      <title>Predicting Customer Goals in Financial Institution Services: A Data-Driven LSTM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's competitive financial landscape, understanding and anticipating customer goals is crucial for institutions to deliver a personalized and optimized user experience. This has given rise to the problem of accurately predicting customer goals and actions. Focusing on that problem, we use historical customer traces generated by a realistic simulator and present two simple models for predicting customer goals and future actions -- an LSTM model and an LSTM model enhanced with state-space graph embeddings. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models when it comes to predicting customer goals and actions.</description>

      <title>An empirical study of market risk factors for Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study examines whether broader market factors and the Fama-French three-factor model can effectively analyze the idiosyncratic risk and return characteristics of Bitcoin. By incorporating Fama-french factors, the explanatory power of these factors on Bitcoin's excess returns over various moving average periods is tested. The analysis aims to determine if equity market factors are significant in explaining and modeling systemic risk in Bitcoin.</description>

      <title>Modelling financial volume curves with hierarchical Poisson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the trading volume curves of financial instruments throughout the day is of key interest in financial trading applications. Predictions of these so-called volume profiles guide trade execution strategies, for example, a common strategy is to trade a desired quantity across many orders in line with the expected volume curve throughout the day so as not to impact the price of the instrument. The volume curves (for each day) are naturally grouped by stock and can be further gathered into higher-level groupings, such as by industry. In order to model such admixtures of volume curves, we introduce a hierarchical Poisson process model for the intensity functions of admixtures of inhomogenous Poisson processes, which represent the trading times of the stock throughout the day. The model is based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process, and an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is derived following the slice sampling framework for Bayesian nonparametric mixture models. We demonstrate the method on datasets of different stocks from the Trade and Quote repository maintained by Wharton Research Data Services, including the most liquid stock on the NASDAQ stock exchange, Apple, demonstrating the scalability of the approach.</description>

      <title>Temporal distribution of clusters of investors and their application in prediction with expert advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial organisations such as brokers face a significant challenge in servicing the investment needs of thousands of their traders worldwide. This task is further compounded since individual traders will have their own risk appetite and investment goals. Traders may look to capture short-term trends in the market which last only seconds to minutes, or they may have longer-term views which last several days to months. To reduce the complexity of this task, client trades can be clustered. By examining such clusters, we would likely observe many traders following common patterns of investment, but how do these patterns vary through time? Knowledge regarding the temporal distributions of such clusters may help financial institutions manage the overall portfolio of risk that accumulates from underlying trader positions. This study contributes to the field by demonstrating that the distribution of clusters derived from the real-world trades of 20k Foreign Exchange (FX) traders (from 2015 to 2017) is described in accordance with Ewens' Sampling Distribution. Further, we show that the Aggregating Algorithm (AA), an on-line prediction with expert advice algorithm, can be applied to the aforementioned real-world data in order to improve the returns of portfolios of trader risk. However we found that the AA 'struggles' when presented with too many trader ``experts'', especially when there are many trades with similar overall patterns. To help overcome this challenge, we have applied and compared the use of Statistically Validated Networks (SVN) with a hierarchical clustering approach on a subset of the data, demonstrating that both approaches can be used to significantly improve results of the AA in terms of profitability and smoothness of returns.</description>

      <title>Electricity Spot Prices Forecasting Using Stochastic Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several approaches to modeling and forecasting time series as applied to prices of commodities and financial assets. One of the approaches is to model the price as a non-stationary time series process with heteroscedastic volatility (variance of price). The goal of the research is to generate probabilistic forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices in a spot marker employing stochastic volatility models. A typical stochastic volatility model - that treats the volatility as a latent stochastic process in discrete time - is explored first. Then the research focuses on enriching the baseline model by introducing several exogenous regressors. A better fitting model - as compared to the baseline model - is derived as a result of the research. Out-of-sample forecasts confirm the applicability and robustness of the enriched model. This model may be used in financial derivative instruments for hedging the risk associated with electricity trading.

      <title>Dissecting Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we address the question of the Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis method that has been subject to some controversies since its inception almost two decades ago. To this end we propose several new options to deal with negative cross-covariance among two time series, that may serve to construct a more robust view of the multifractal spectrum among the series. We compare these novel options with the proposals already existing in the literature, and we provide fast code in C, R and Python for both new and the already existing proposals. We test different algorithms on synthetic series with an exact analytical solution, as well as on daily price series of ethanol and sugar in Brazil from 2010 to 2023.</description>

      <title>Modeling a Financial System with Memory via Fractional Calculus and Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets have long since been modeled using stochastic methods such as Brownian motion, and more recently, rough volatility models have been built using fractional Brownian motion. This fractional aspect brings memory into the system. In this project, we describe and analyze a financial model based on the fractional Langevin equation with colored noise generated by fractional Brownian motion. Physics-based methods of analysis are used to examine the phase behavior and dispersion relations of the system upon varying input parameters. A type of anomalous marginal glass phase is potentially seen in some regions, which motivates further exploration of this model and expanded use of phase behavior and dispersion relation methods to analyze financial models.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Consistent Analysis of Realized Covariations in Term Structure Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we show how to analyze the covariation of bond prices nonparametrically and robustly, staying consistent with a general no-arbitrage setting. This is, in particular, motivated by the problem of identifying the number of statistically relevant factors in the bond market under minimal conditions. We apply this method in an empirical study which suggests that a high number of factors is needed to describe the term structure evolution and that the term structure of volatility varies over time.</description>

      <title>Stock Volume Forecasting with Advanced Information by Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of Conditional Variational Encoder (CVAE) to improve the forecasts of daily stock volume time series in both short and long term forecasting tasks, with the use of advanced information of input variables such as rebalancing dates. CVAE generates non-linear time series as out-of-sample forecasts, which have better accuracy and closer fit of correlation to the actual data, compared to traditional linear models. These generative forecasts can also be used for scenario generation, which aids interpretation. We further discuss correlations in non-stationary time series and other potential extensions from the CVAE forecasts.</description>

      <title>On Finding Bi-objective Pareto-optimal Fraud Prevention Rule Sets for Fintech Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rules are widely used in Fintech institutions to make fraud prevention decisions, since rules are highly interpretable thanks to their intuitive if-then structure. In practice, a two-stage framework of fraud prevention decision rule set mining is usually employed in large Fintech institutions; Stage 1 generates a potentially large pool of rules and Stage 2 aims to produce a refined rule subset according to some criteria (typically based on precision and recall). This paper focuses on improving the flexibility and efficacy of this two-stage framework, and is concerned with finding high-quality rule subsets in a bi-objective space (such as precision and recall). To this end, we first introduce a novel algorithm called SpectralRules that directly generates a compact pool of rules in Stage 1 with high diversity. We empirically find such diversity improves the quality of the final rule subset. In addition, we introduce an intermediate stage between Stage 1 and 2 that adopts the concept of Pareto optimality and aims to find a set of non-dominated rule subsets, which constitutes a Pareto front. This intermediate stage greatly simplifies the selection criteria and increases the flexibility of Stage 2. For this intermediate stage, we propose a heuristic-based framework called PORS and we identify that the core of PORS is the problem of solution selection on the front (SSF). We provide a systematic categorization of the SSF problem and a thorough empirical evaluation of various SSF methods on both public and proprietary datasets. On two real application scenarios within Alipay, we demonstrate the advantages of our proposed methodology over existing work.</description>
