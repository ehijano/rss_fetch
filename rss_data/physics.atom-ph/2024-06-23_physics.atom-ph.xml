      <title>Symmetries in 3D photoelectron momentum spectroscopy as precursory methods for dichroic and enantiosensitive measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) are measured from an atomic target ionized by ultrafast, elliptical fields of opposite handedness. Comparing these PADs to one another and to numeric simulations, a difficult to avoid systematic error in their orientation is identified and subsequently corrected by imposing the dichroic symmetry by which they are necessarily related. We show that this correction can be directly applied to molecular targets in the same fields. This paves the way for measurement of enantiosensitive information which has yet to be accessed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Observation of Continuous Time Crystal in a Spin Maser System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair interaction potentials between atoms in a crystal are in general non-monotonic in distance, with a local minimum whose position gives the lattice constant of the crystal. A temporal analogue of this idea of crystal formation is still pending despite intensive studies on the time crystal phase. In a hybrid spin maser system with a time delay feedback, we report the observation of a continuous time crystal induced by a retarded interaction with a characteristic time scale. This nonequilibrium phase features a self-sustained oscillation with an emergent frequency other than the intrinsic Larmor precession frequency of the spin maser system. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillation is robust against perturbation, while its time phase randomly distributes from 0 to $2\pi$ for different realizations, a signature of spontaneous continuous time translation symmetry breaking. This CTC phase emerges only when the feedback strength exceeds a critical value, at which the system experiences a first order phase transition. Such a retarded interaction induced CTC is closer to the original idea of crystal, compared to mechanisms in other time crystal proposals.</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing of functionalised atomic vapour cells for next-generation quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic vapour cells are an indispensable tool for quantum technologies (QT), but potential improvements are limited by the capacities of conventional manufacturing methods. Using an additive manufacturing (AM) technique - vat polymerisation by digital light processing - we demonstrate, for the first time, a 3D-printed glass vapour cell. The exploitation of AM capacities allows intricate internal architectures, overprinting of 2D optoelectronical materials to create integrated sensors and surface functionalisation, while also showing the ability to tailor the optical properties of the AM glass by in-situ growth of gold nanoparticles. The produced cells achieve ultra-high vacuum of $2 \times 10^{-9}$ mbar and enable Doppler-free spectroscopy; we demonstrate laser frequency stabilisation as a QT application. These results highlight the transformative role that AM can play for QT in enabling compact, optimised and integrated multi-material components and devices.</description>

      <title>Sub-millisecond Entanglement and iSWAP Gate between Molecular Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation (QC) and simulation rely on long-lived qubits with controllable interactions. Early work in quantum computing made use of molecules because of their readily available intramolecular nuclear spin coupling and chemical shifts, along with mature nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Subsequently, the pursuit of many physical platforms has flourished. Trapped polar molecules have been proposed as a promising quantum computing platform, offering scalability and single-particle addressability while still leveraging inherent complexity and strong couplings of molecules. Recent progress in the single quantum state preparation and coherence of the hyperfine-rotational states of individually trapped molecules allows them to serve as promising qubits, with intermolecular dipolar interactions creating entanglement. However, universal two-qubit gates have not been demonstrated with molecules. Here, we harness intrinsic molecular resources to implement a two-qubit iSWAP gate using individually trapped $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ NaCs molecules. We characterize the innate dipolar interaction between rotational states and control its strength by tuning the polarization of the traps. By allowing the molecules to interact for 664 $\mu$s at a distance of 1.9 $\mu$m, we create a maximally entangled Bell state with a fidelity of 94(3)\%, following postselection to remove trials with empty traps. Using motion-rotation coupling, we measure residual excitation of the lowest few motional states along the axial trapping direction and find them to be the primary source of decoherence. Finally, we identify two non-interacting hyperfine states within the ground rotational level in which we encode a qubit. The interaction is toggled by transferring between interacting and non-interacting states to realize an iSWAP gate. We verify the gate performance by measuring its logical truth table.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Mobile Optical Clock Ensemble at Sea</title>

Abstract: Atomic clocks have been at the leading edge of accuracy and precision since their inception in the 1950s. However, typically the most capable of these clocks have been confined to laboratories despite the fact that there are compelling reasons to apply them in the field and/or while in motion. These applications include synchronization of distributed critical infrastructure (e.g. data servers, communications, electricity grids), scientific applications (e.g. radio-astronomy) and to mitigate the effects of interruption to Global Navigation Satellite Systems.
  Over the last 20 years, there has been a breakthrough in the performance of atomic clocks by transitioning from an atomic reference based on a microwave transition to an optical frequency transition. The $10^5$-fold increase in reference frequency confers the potential for significantly higher performance. However, this performance increase has come at the cost of size, complexity and fragility which has continued the confinement of these clocks to the laboratory.
  Here we report on a recent international collaboration where three emerging optical clocks, each operating on different principles, were trialed at sea. These clocks incorporate optical frequency combs so that their stable frequency outputs can be used directly in electronic apparatus and were also automated so that they do not require expert supervision. We present the frequency stability and reliability of these three clocks over multiple weeks of unsupervised naval trials, both in harbour and on the ocean. The performance of all three devices was orders of magnitude superior to existing best-in-class commercial solutions over short and medium timescales. This demonstrates that optical clocks are ready to deliver advantages for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Trapped atoms and superradiance on an integrated nanophotonic microring circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interfacing cold atoms with integrated nanophotonic devices could offer new paradigms for engineering atom-light interactions and provide a potentially scalable route for quantum sensing, metrology, and quantum information processing. However, it remains a challenging task to efficiently trap a large ensemble of cold atoms on an integrated nanophotonic circuit. Here, we demonstrate direct loading of an ensemble of up to 70 atoms into an optical microtrap on a nanophotonic microring circuit. Efficient trap loading is achieved by employing degenerate Raman-sideband cooling in the microtrap, where a built-in spin-motion coupling arises directly from the vector light shift of the evanescent field potential on a microring. Atoms are cooled into the trap via optical pumping with a single free space beam. We have achieved a trap lifetime approaching 700ms under continuous cooling. We show that the trapped atoms display large cooperative coupling and superradiant decay into a whispering-gallery mode of the microring resonator, holding promise for explorations of new collective effects. Our technique can be extended to trapping a large ensemble of cold atoms on nanophotonic circuits for various quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent Three-Photon Excitation of the Strontium Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently demonstrated a continuous Bose-Einstein condensate of strontium atoms. We could turn this into a continuous-wave atom laser if an efficient outcoupling mechanism is found. Here we show a coherent three-photon excitation of the clock transition in a strontium BEC with contrast of 44.6(3.5)%. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer. Our work constitutes an essential step towards the outcoupling of a continuous atom laser beam and provides a robust excitation mechanism for quantum simulation.</description>
