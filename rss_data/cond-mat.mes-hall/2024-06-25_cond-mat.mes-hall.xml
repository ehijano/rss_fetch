      <title>Entangelment Entropy on Generalized Brillouin Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model from the perspective of the Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ). The non-Bloch entanglement entropy is defined on a quasi-reciprocal lattice, obtained by performing an ordinary Fourier transformation on the non-Bloch Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the broken bulk-boundary correspondence is recovered in terms of the non-Bloch entanglement entropy. When the GBZ is circular, we show that the non-Bloch entanglement entropy is well-defined (real and positive-definite) in large parameter regions, except close to the exceptional points (EPs). In the critical region, we found that each Fermi point contributes precisely 1 to the central charge $c$ of the logarithmic scaling. At the EP, the central charge becomes negative due to the presence of the exceptional bound state. For the case of non-circular GBZ, long-range hopping emerges in the quasi-reciprocal lattice, and the von Neumann entropy on the GBZ is no longer real. However, the non-Bloch edge entanglement entropy remains real, which serves as a reliable topological indicator and respects the bulk-boundary correspondence. We compute the topological phase diagram, and reveal the critical behavior along the exceptional phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive acoustic graphene plasmons in a graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure: strong plasmon-phonon coupling and wavelength sensitivity enhanced by a metal screen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic plasmons in graphene exhibit strong confinement induced by a proximate metal surface and hybridize with phonons of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) when these materials are combined in a van der Waals heterostructure, thus forming screened graphene plasmon-phonon polaritons (SGPPPs), a type of acoustic mode. While SGPPPs are shown to be very sensitive to the dielectric properties of the environment, enhancing the SGPPPs coupling strength in realistic heterostructures is still challenging. Here we employ the quantum electrostatic heterostructure model, which builds upon the density functional theory calculations for monolayers, to show that the use of a metal as a substrate for graphene-TMD heterostructures (i) vigorously enhances the coupling strength between acoustic plasmons and the TMD phonons, and (ii) markedly improves the sensitivity of the plasmon wavelength on the structural details of the host platform in real space, thus allowing one to use the effect of environmental screening on acoustic plasmons to probe the structure and composition of a van der Waals heterostructure down to the monolayer resolution.</description>

      <title>Depinning, Melting and Sliding of Generalized Wigner Crystals in Moire Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically examine the depinning, sliding, and melting of commensurate and incommensurate Wigner crystals on two-dimensional hexagonal periodic substrates near fillings of 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 to model the dynamics of generalized Wigner crystals in moire heterostructures. At low temperatures where thermal fluctuations are irrelevant, for commensurate fillings we find a strongly pinned state that depins into a sliding crystal, while at incommensurate fillings, the depinning threshold is strongly reduced. For fillings below 1/2, the depinning occurs in a two-step process. Above the first depinning threshold, there is an extended range of drives where the conduction occurs via the sliding of anti-kinks along the charge stripes, followed by a second threshold where all of the charges begin to slide. At finite temperatures, the external driving reduces the effective melting temperature at commensurate fillings and enhances creep at incommensurate fillings. We show that depinning into different sliding states, such as moving fluids or moving crystals, produces nonlinear features in the transport curves. We also show that transport is asymmetric on either side of a commensurate filling due to the different dynamics for interstitials versus holes in the commensurate structure. A variety of sliding states should be accessible for generalized Wigner crystals at finite temperatures even for low drives. If experiments can realize sliding dynamics in moire systems, it would open a new class of commensurate and incommensurate phases for study. Additionally, the sliding dynamics and anti-kink flow could provide new functionalities for charge transport in moire heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Theory of excitonic complexes in gated WSe$_2$ quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer quantum dot gate potential causes type-II band alignment, i.e. electrostatically confines holes and repels electrons, or vice versa. Hence, the confinement of excitons in gated type II quantum dots involves a delicate balance of the repulsion of electrons due to the gate potential with the attraction caused by the Coulomb interaction with a hole localized in the quantum dot. This work presents a theory for neutral excitonic complexes within gated $\text{WSe}_\text{2}$ quantum dots, considering spin, valley, electronic orbitals, and many-body interactions. We analyze how the electron-hole attraction depends on a range of system parameters, such as screened Coulomb interaction, strength of confinement of holes, and repulsion of electrons. Using an atomistic tight binding model we compute valence and conduction band states within a computational box comprising over one million atoms with applied gate potential. The atomistic wavefunctions are then used to calculate direct and exchange Coulomb matrix elements for a fictitious type I quantum dot, and to obtain a spectrum of interacting electron-hole pairs. Next, we study the effect of repulsive potential, pulling away electrons from the valence hole. We determine whether electron-hole pairs are sufficiently attracted to overcome electron repulsion by the confinement potential. Finally, we compute the dipole transition between hole and electron states to obtain the absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Auto-oscillations with a single Spin Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic auto-oscillations are damping-compensated magnetization precessions. They can be generated in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) among others. Current research on these devices is dedicated to create next generation energy-efficient hardware for communication technologies. However, the underlying physics governing the formation of auto-oscillation modes, their output power and line width in a single SHNO device have remained elusive so far. We image the sources of magnetic auto-oscillations in a metallic SHNO using a single spin quantum sensor. We directly measure the microwave field generated by an auto-oscillation spot at the nanoscale by driving the electron spin resonance transition of the sensor spin, enabling faster acquisition speed (100 ms/pixel). Instead of being defined by the points of the largest antidamping only, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time with quantitative magnetometry that the auto-oscillation spots are determined by the positions of the magnetic field minima. The latter act as local potential wells for confining spin-waves, thus supporting large amplitude auto-oscillations. By comparing the magnitude of the magnetic stray field at these spots, we decipher the different frequencies of the auto-oscillation modes. The insights gained regarding the interaction between auto-oscillation modes and spin-wave potential wells enable advanced engineering of real devices.</description>

      <title>Resonant plasmon-assisted tunneling in a double quantum dot coupled to a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge magnetoplasmon is an emergent chiral bosonic mode promising for studying electronic quantum optics. While the plasmon transport has been investigated with various techniques for decades,its coupling to a mesoscopic device remained unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the coupling between a single plasmon mode in a quantum Hall plasmon resonator and a double quantum dot (DQD). Resonant plasmon-assisted tunneling is observed in the DQD through absorbing or emitting plasmons stored in the resonator. By using the DQD as a spectrometer, the plasmon energy and the coupling strength are evaluated, which can be controlled by changing the electrostatic environment of the quantum Hall edge. The observed plasmon-electron coupling encourages us for studying strong coupling regimes of plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Picosecond all-optical switching of Co/Gd based synthetic ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single pulse all-optical switching of magnetization (AOS) in Co/Gd based synthetic ferrimagnets carries promises for hybrid spintronic-photonic integration. A crucial next step progressing towards this vision is to gain insight into AOS and multi-domain state (MDS) behavior using longer pulses, which is compatible with state-of-the-art integrated photonics. In this work, we present our studies on the AOS and MDS of [Co/Gd]n (n = 1, 2) using ps optical pulses across a large composition range. We theoretically and experimentally show that a large Gd layer thickness can enhance the AOS energy efficiency and maximum pulse duration. We have identified two augmenting roles of Gd in extending the maximum pulse duration. On the inter-atomic level, we found that more Gd offers a prolonged angular momentum supply to Co. On the micromagnetic level, a higher Gd content brings the system to be closer to magnetic compensation in the equilibrized hot state, thereby reducing the driving force for thermally assisted nucleation of domain walls, combating the formation of a MDS. Our study presents a composition overview of AOS in [Co/Gd]n and offers useful physical insights regarding AOS fundamentals as well as the projected photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Heat conduction in low-dimensional electron gases without and with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of heat conduction in two-dimensional (2D) electron gases without and with a magnetic field. We perform simulations with the Multi-Particle-Collision approach, suitably adapted to account for the Lorenz force acting on the particles. For zero magnetic field, we find that the heat conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with the system size $L$ following the logarithmic relation $\kappa\thicksim \ln L$ (as predicted for two-dimensional (2D) systems) for small $L$ values; however, in the thermodynamic limit the heat conductivity tends to follow the relation $\kappa\thicksim L^{1/3}$, as predicted for one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This suggests the presence of a dimensional-crossover effect in heat conduction in electronic systems that adhere to standard momentum conservation. Under the magnetic field, time-reversal symmetry is broken and the standard momentum conservation in the system is no longer satisfied but the \emph{pseudomomentum} of the system is still conserved. In contrast with the zero-field case, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations indicate a finite heat conductivity independent on the system size $L$ as $L$ increases. This indicates that pseudomomentum conservation can exhibit normal diffusive heat transport, which differs from the abnormal behavior observed in low-dimensional coupled charged harmonic oscillators with pseudomomentum conservation in a magnetic field. These findings support the validity of the hydrodynamic theory in electron gases and clarify that pseudomomentum conservation is not enough to ensure the anomalous behavior of heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Wave functions in the Critical Phase: a Planar \textit{Sierpi\'{n}ski} Fractal Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic states play a crucial role in many quantum systems of moire superlattices, quasicrystals, and fractals. As recently reported in \textit{Sierpi\'{n}ski} lattices [Phys. Rev. B 107, 115424 (2023)], the critical states are revealed by the energy level-correlation spectra, which are caused by the interplay between aperiodicity and determined self-similarity characters. In the case of the \textit{Sierpi\'{n}ski Carpet}, our results further demonstrate that there is some degree of spatial overlap between these electronic states. These states could be strongly affected by its `seed lattice' of the $generator$, and slightly modulated by the dilation pattern and the geometrical self-similarity level. These electronic states are multifractal by scaling the $q$-order inverse participation ratio or fractal dimension, which correlates with the subdiffusion behavior. In the $gene$ pattern, the averaged state-based multifractal dimension of second-order would increase as its \textit{Hausdoff dimension} increases. Our findings could potentially contribute to understanding quantum transports and single-particle quantum dynamics in fractals.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable giant Nernst effect in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric phenomenon, has attracted significant attention for its potential in energy conversion, thermoelectrics, and spintronics. However, achieving high performance and versatility at low temperatures remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a large and electrically tunable Nernst effect by combining graphene's electrical properties with indium selenide's semiconducting nature in a field-effect geometry. Our results establish a novel platform for exploring and manipulating this thermoelectric effect, showcasing the first electrical tunability with an on/off ratio of 10^3. Moreover, photocurrent measurements reveal a stronger photo-Nernst signal in the Gr/InSe heterostructure compared to individual components. Remarkably, we observe a record-high Nernst coefficient of 66.4 {\mu}V K^(-1) T^(-1) at ultra-low temperatures and low magnetic fields, paving the way toward applications in quantum information and low-temperature emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Free Electron Theory for Thin Metal Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum free electrons, i.e. plane waves, with wavevector k, and occupancy constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle, are explained in all introductory texts about solids. A free-electron description works surprisingly well for many properties of "simple" metals. It is assumed that the interior of the metal is essentially infinite, and surfaces are presumed irrelevant. Over the past 30 years, experiments that visualize surfaces have revolutionized solid state physics, stimulating new theory and applications. Therefore, a basic question is, how can the free electron picture be applied to properties of solids where surfaces play a prominent role? Various versions of an extended free-electron theory are used, but not always explained pedagogically. This paper focusses on idealized metallic films. Three versions (an oversimplified one and two stages of improvement) of a free-electron description of metal films are given. These versions are illustrated in detail for the specific example of a slab of aluminum with six layers of atoms.</description>

      <title>Nanopatterning of multicomponent van der Waals heterostructures using atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have become an important platform in which to study novel fundamental effects emerging at the nanoscale. Standard nanopatterning techniques relying on electron-beam lithography and reactive ion etching, widely applied to pattern such heterostructures, however, impose some limitations on the edge accuracy and resolution, as revealed through numerous experiments with vdW quantum dots and point contacts. Here we present an alternative approach for electrode-free nanopatterning of thick multilayer vdW heterostructures based on atomic force microscopy (AFM). By applying an AC voltage of a relatively small frequency (1-10 kHz) between the sharp platinum tip and the substrate, we realize high-resolution ($\lesssim 100$ nm) etching of thick multicomponent heterostructures if the latter are deposited onto graphite slabs. Importantly, unlike more conventional electrode-free local anodic oxidation, our method does not require a special environment with excess humidity, can be applied at ambient conditions, and enables the patterning of multilayer heterostructures composed of graphene, graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), NbSe$_{2}$, WSe$_{2}$, and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable, high-quality quantum dots has proven challenging within device architectures rooted in conventional solid-state device fabrication paradigms. In fact, these are grappled with complex protocols in order to balance ease of realization, scalability, and quantum transport properties. Here, we demonstrate a novel paradigm of semiconductor quantum dot engineering by exploiting ion gating. Our approach is found to enable the realization and control of a novel quantum dot system: the iontronic quantum dot. Clear Coulomb blockade peaks and their dependence on an externally applied magnetic field are reported, together with the impact of device architecture and confinement potential on quantum dot quality. Devices incorporating two identical quantum dots in series are realized, addressing the reproducibility of the developed approach. The iontronic quantum dot represents a novel class of zero-dimensional quantum devices engineered to overcome the need for thin dielectric layers, facilitating single-step device fabrication. Overall, the reported approach holds the potential to revolutionize the development of functional quantum materials and devices, driving rapid progress in solid state quantum technologies</description>

      <title>Constraints on the orbital flux phase in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ from polar Kerr effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) family of Kagome metals hosts unconventional charge density wave order whose nature is still an open puzzle. Accumulated evidences point to a time-reversal symmetry breaking orbital flux phase that carries loop currents. Such an order may support anomalous Hall effect. However, the polar Kerr effect measurements that probe the a.c. anomalous Hall conductivity seems to have yielded contradictory results. We first argue on symmetry grounds that some previously proposed orbital flux order, most notably the one with Star-of-David distortion, shall not give rise to anomalous Hall or polar Kerr effects. We further take the tri-hexagonal orbital flux phase as an exemplary Kagome flux order that does exhibit anomalous Hall response, and show that the Kerr rotation angle at two relevant experimental optical frequencies generally reaches microradians to sub-milliradians levels. A particularly sharp resonance enhancement is observed at around $\hbar \omega =1$ eV, suggesting exceedingly large Kerr rotation at the corresponding probing frequencies not yet accessed by previous experiments. Our study can help to interpret the Kerr measurements on $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and to eventually resolve the nature of their CDW order.</description>

      <title>Terahertz photocurrent probe of quantum geometry and interactions in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials represent strongly interacting electron systems bridging topological and correlated physics. Despite significant advances, decoding wavefunction properties underlying the quantum geometry remains challenging. Here, we utilize polarization-resolved photocurrent measurements to probe magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, leveraging its sensitivity to the Berry connection that encompasses quantum "textures" of electron wavefunctions. Using terahertz light resonant with optical transitions of its flat bands, we observe bulk photocurrents driven by broken symmetries and reveal the interplay between electron interactions and quantum geometry. We observe inversion-breaking gapped states undetectable through quantum transport, sharp changes in the polarization axes caused by interaction-induced band renormalization, and recurring photocurrent patterns at integer fillings of the moir\'e unit cell that track the evolution of quantum geometry through the cascade of phase transitions. The large and tunable terahertz response intrinsic to flat-band systems offers direct insights into the quantum geometry of interacting electrons and paves the way for innovative terahertz quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases for Extended Objects: Semiclassical Phase-Space Approach with Tensorial Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been established that certain higher-dimensional topological phases of matter support extended objects like quasi-strings and quasi-membranes in their bulk states. In this study, we investigate the physics of these topological systems using a phase-space approach in the semiclassical regime, incorporating tensorial coordinates related to the extended objects. Specifically, we explore the semiclassical currents associated to open quasi-strings in topological phases in three spatial dimensions, considering the presence of both coordinate-space Kalb-Ramond fields and momentum-space tensor Berry connections. Our results show that the currents associated to the endpoints of open quasi-strings on the system's boundary exhibit a quantized Hall response. This formalism accurately reproduces the boundary response as predicted by an Abelian BF theory proving a novel way to study extended objects in topological matter.</description>

      <title>Topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topology, one averages over local geometrical details to reveal robust global features. This approach proves crucial for understanding quantized bulk transport and exotic boundary effects of linear wave propagation in (meta-)materials. Moving beyond linear Hamiltonian systems, the study of topology in physics strives to characterize open (non-Hermitian) and interacting systems. Here, we establish a framework for the topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems. Specifically, we define a graph index for the Floquet semiclassical equations of motion describing such systems. The graph index builds upon topological vector analysis theory and combines knowledge of the particle-hole nature of fluctuations around each out-of-equilibrium stationary state. To test this approach, we divulge the topological invariants arising in a micro-electromechanical nonlinear resonator subject to forcing and a time-modulated potential. Our framework classifies the complete phase diagram of the system and reveals the topological origin of driven-dissipative phase transitions, as well as that of under- to over-damped responses. Furthermore, we predict topological phase transitions between symmetry-broken phases that pertain to population inversion transitions. This rich manifesting phenomenology reveals the pervasive link between topology and nonlinear dynamics, with broad implications for all fields of science.</description>

      <title>Evidence of directional structural superlubricity and L\'evy flights in a van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity is a special frictionless contact in which two crystals are in incommensurate arrangement such that relative in-plane translation is associated with vanishing energy barrier crossing. So far, it has been realized in multilayer graphene and other van der Waals two-dimensional crystals with hexagonal or triangular crystalline symmetries, leading to isotropic frictionless contacts. Directional structural superlubricity, to date unrealized in two-dimensional systems, is possible when the reciprocal lattices of the two crystals coincide in one direction only. Here, we evidence directional structural superlubricity a $\alpha$-bismuthene/graphite van der Waals system, manifested by spontaneous hopping of the islands over hundreds of nanometres at room temperature, resolved by low-energy electron microscopy and supported by registry simulations. Statistical analysis of individual and collective $\alpha$-bismuthene islands populations reveal a heavy-tailed distribution of the hopping lengths and sticking times indicative of L\'evy flight dynamics, largely unobserved in massive condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state via quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent attention has been drawn to temperature gradient generated $\Delta_T$ noise at vanishing charge current. This study delves into examining the properties of spin-polarised $\Delta T$ noise in conjunction with $\Delta_T$-shot noise, $\Delta_T$-thermal noise, and quantum noise (again both shot and thermal noise) in a one-dimensional (1D) structure comprising metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction to probe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. YSR bound states, which are localized states within the superconducting gap of a superconductor are induced by a magnetic impurity acting as a spin-flipper. A YSR bound state should be distinguished from a Majorana bound state (MBS), which too can occur due to interaction with magnetic impurities, e.g., magnetic adatoms on superconductors, and this can lead to false positives in detecting MBS. Clarifying this by providing a unique signature for the YSR-bound state is the main aim of this work. In this paper, we show that YSR bound states can be effectively probed using quantum noise and the recently discovered $\Delta_T$ noise, with a focus on especially spin transport. We see that the spin $\Delta_T$ noise is a superior tool compared to the charge $\Delta_T$ noise as a probe for YSR bound states. Additionally, our analysis of quantum noise reveals that similar to $\Delta_T$ noise, spin quantum noise is more effective than charge quantum noise in detecting YSR bound states.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Spectral Windings and Skin Modes through Nonconservative Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has revolutionized our understanding of wave propagation in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting unexpected localization effects beyond conventional theories. Here, we discover that NHSE, accompanied by multi-type spectral phases, can be induced by manipulating nonconservative couplings. By characterizing the spectrum through the windings of the energy bands, we demonstrate that band structures with identical, opposite, and even twisted windings can be achieved. These inequivalent types of spectra originate from the multi-channel interference resulting from the interplay between conservative and nonconservative couplings. Associated with the multi-type spectra, unipolar and bipolar NHSE with different eigenmode localizations can be observed. Additionally, our findings link the nonreciprocal transmission properties of the system to multiple spectral phases, indicating a connection with the skin modes. This work paves new pathways for investigating non-Hermitian topological effects and manipulating nonreciprocal energy flow.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced photoprotection in neuroprotein architectures emerges from collective light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study here the collective quantum optical effect of superradiance in neuroprotein architectures. This phenomenon arises from the interaction of the electromagnetic field with an organized network of tryptophan chromophores, where each can be effectively modeled as a two-level quantum emitter. Building on our prior experimental confirmation of single-photon superradiance in microtubules, we predict that bright superradiant states will also emerge in simulated actin filament bundles and amyloid fibrils, which manifests in the form of high quantum yields that are robust to static disorder up to five times that of room temperature. For microtubules and amyloid fibrils, the quantum yield is enhanced with increasing system size, contrary to the conventional expectations of quantum effects in a thermally equilibrated environment. We conduct our analyses using a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived from the Lindblad equation for an open quantum system that describes the interaction of a chromophore network with the electromagnetic field, in the single-photon limit. Our detailed quantum yield predictions in realistic neuroprotein structures -- including analysis of the potential information-processing applications of correlated superradiant and subradiant states at divergent timescales -- provide motivation for a range of in vitro experiments to confirm these quantum enhancements, which can serve in vivo as a mechanism for dissipating or downconverting high-energy UV metabolic photon emissions in intensely oxidative pathological environments, including those found in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</description>

      <title>Non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule and spinon-dictated electric transport in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric resistivity is examined in the constrained Hilbert space of a doped Mott insulator, which is dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule due to the underlying mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. In the low-temperature pseudogap phase, where holons remain condensed while spinons proliferate, the charge transport is governed by a chiral spinon excitation, comprising a bosonic spin-$1/2$ at the core of a supercurrent vortex. It leads to a vanishing resistivity with the "confinement" of the spinons in the superconducting phase but a low-$T$ divergence of the resistivity once the spinon confinement is disrupted by external magnetic fields. In the latter, the chiral spinons will generate a Hall number $n_H =$ doping concentration $\delta$ and a Nernst effect to signal an underlying long-range entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Their presence is further reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility. Finally, in the high-temperature spin-disordered phase, it is shown that the holons exhibit a linear-$T$ resistivity by scattering with the spinons acting as free local moments, which generate randomized gauge fluxes as perceived by the charge degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Low-Voltage Electron Emission by Graphene-hBN-graphene Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) with low energy electron sources (accelerating voltage of less than 1000V) have important application requirements in many application scenarios. Tunneling junction can potentially achieve low-voltage and planar-type electron sources with good emission current density. However, further lower the extracting voltage while ensure the emission current density remains challenging. In this paper, we report a low-voltage planar-type electron source based on graphene-hBN-graphene heterostructures (GBGH) under a really low out-plane extracting voltage. The external electric field strength applied to the electron sources is only 4 times 10^4V/m and the accelerating voltage as low as 20V is realized. Steady electron emission of over 1nA and operating duration of several hours is observed from the GBGH with size of 59.29um^2 in our experiments, and thus the maximum emission current density reaches 7mA/cm^2. Great electrical contacts, extremely low thickness, and excellent layer properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials lead to easy-fabrication and miniature on-chip electron sources, which would significantly contribute to the development of next-generation free electron devices.</description>

Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with light particle mass and weak particle-particle interaction can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons can be naturally bound to the surface of a QLS in a vacuum and exhibit unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. In this article, we review the historical study and recent progress in this area. The main topics covered in this review include the collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen, the theoretical proposal and experimental effort toward single electron qubits on superfluid helium, the recent experimental realization of single electron charge qubits on solid neon and the related theoretical calculation. In the end, we review and envision extended exploration of quantum electronics on heterogeneous QLS.</description>

Abstract: We present experimental measurements on Young's modulus and Gr\"{u}neisen parameter of multilayer graphene with varying number of layers using in situ bulge tests corroborated by atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Due to the experimental challenges posed by the significant disparity between intra and interlayer mechanical strengths, measuring conclusive elastic parameters are proven difficult. We analyze the results based on a new theoretical model together with first-principles calculations to elucidate the mechanism of thickness dependent incomplete strain transfer across the layers. Our findings indicate that the experimental elastic constants, which differ from intrinsic computed ones, have unavoidable limitations in reflecting ideal mechanical couplings between layers. Consequently, we propose a new mechanical modulus, free from effects of uncontrollable delamination of layers, derived by combining Gr\"{u}neisen parameter with Young's modulus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooper pairs occupy the ground state of superconductors and are typically composed of maximally entangled electrons with opposite spin. In order to study the spin and entanglement properties of these electrons, one must separate them spatially via a process known as Cooper pair splitting (CPS). Here we provide the first demonstration of CPS in a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). By coupling two quantum dots to a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid region we achieve efficient Cooper pair splitting, and clearly distinguish it from other local and non-local processes. When the spin degeneracy of the dots is lifted, they can be operated as spin-filters to obtain information about the spin of the electrons forming the Cooper pair. Not only do we observe a near perfect splitting of Cooper pairs into opposite-spin electrons (i.e. conventional singlet pairing), but also into equal-spin electrons, thus achieving triplet correlations between the quantum dots. Importantly, the exceptionally large spin-orbit interaction in our 2DEGs results in a strong triplet component, comparable in amplitude to the singlet pairing. The demonstration of CPS in a scalable and flexible platform provides a credible route to study on-chip entanglement and topological superconductivity in the form of artificial Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Tuning the thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires by surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using large scale molecular dynamics simulations, we study the thermal conductivity of bare and surface passivated silicon nanowires (SiNWs). For the cross-sectional widths $w \le 2$ nm, SiNWs become unstable because of the surface amorphosization and also due to the evaporation of a certain fraction of Si atoms. The observed surface (in-)stability is related to a large excess energy $\Delta$ of the surface Si atoms with respect to the bulk Si, resulting from the surface atoms being less coordinated and having dangling bonds.We first propose a practically relevant method that uses $\Delta$ as a guiding tool to passivate these dangling bonds with hydrogen or oxygen, stabilizing the SiNWs. These passivated SiNWs are used to calculate the thermal conductivity coefficient $\kappa$.While the expected trend of $\kappa \propto w$ is observed for all SiNWs, surface passivation provides an added flexibility of tuning $\kappa$ with the surface coverage concentration $c$ of passivated atoms.Indeed, with respect to the bulk $\kappa$, passivation of SiNW reduces $\kappa$ by 75-80\% for $c \to 50\%$ and recovers again by 50\% for the fully passivated samples. Analyzing the phonon band structures via spectral energy density, we discuss separate contributions from the surface and the core to $\kappa$. Our results also reveal that surface passivation increases SiNW stiffness, contributing to the tunability in $\kappa$.</description>

Our findings indicate that the diffusivity of orbital angular momentum in metals is much lower than that of spin or charge due to the strong orbital intermixing in crystals. Furthermore, our theory introduces the concept of spin-orbit polarization by which a pure orbital (spin) current induces a longitudinal spin (orbital) current, a process as efficient as spin polarization in ferromagnets. Finally, we find that orbital currents undergo momentum swapping, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. This theory establishes several key parameters for orbital transport of direct importance to experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect induced by chiral fluctuations in ErMn6Sn6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Hall effect (THE) is a hallmark of scalar spin chirality, which is found in static skyrmion lattices. Recent theoretical works have shown that scalar spin chirality could also emerge dynamically from thermal spin fluctuations. Evidence of such a mechanism was found in the kagome magnet YMn6Sn6 where fluctuations arise from frustrated exchange interactions between Mn kagome layers. In YMn6Sn6, the rare-earth ion Y3+ is non-magnetic. When it is replaced by a magnetic ion (Gd3+-Ho3+), the intrinsically antiferromagnetic Mn-Mn interlayer coupling is overwhelmed by the indirect ferromagnetic Mn-R-Mn one, relieving frustration. This generates interesting anomalous Hall conductivity, but not THE. Here we show that Er lies in an intermediate regime where direct and indirect interactions closely compete, so that ErMn6Sn6 can switch from one regime to the other by temperature, i.e., from a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state to a spiral antiferromagnet at 78 K. The AFM phase forms a dome in the temperature-field phase diagram. Close to the boundary of this dome, we find a sizable fluctuations-driven THE, thus underscoring the universality of this chiral fluctuation mechanism for generating non-zero scalar spin chirality.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of electron spin qubit during transfer between two semiconductor quantum dots at low magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron shuttling is one of the currently pursued avenues towards the scalability of semiconductor quantum dot-based spin qubits. We theoretically analyze the dephasing of a spin qubit adiabatically transferred between two tunnel-coupled quantum dots. We focus on the regime where the Zeeman splitting is lower than the tunnel coupling, at which interdot tunneling with spin flip is absent, and analyze the sources of errors in spin-coherent electron transfer for Si- and GaAs-based quantum dots. Apart from the obvious effect of fluctuations in spin splitting in each dot (e.g., due to nuclear Overhauser fields) leading to finite $ T_{2}^{*} $ of the stationary spin qubit, we consider effects activated by detuning sweeps aimed at adiabatic qubit transfer between the dots: failure of charge transfer caused by charge noise and phonons, spin relaxation due to enhancement of spin-orbit mixing of levels, and spin dephasing caused by low- and high-frequency noise coupling to the electron's charge in the presence of differences in Zeeman splittings between the two dots. Our results indicate that achieving coherent transfer of electron spin in a $10\,\mu$m long dot array necessitates a large and uniform tunnel coupling, with a typical value of $ 2t_c \gtrsim 60 \, \mu$eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that driving optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where material properties oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and can be accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation. We make predictions for time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results show the possibility of using THz waves in solids to realize tunable incommensurate order on the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: We show that sublattice-polarized states (SLPSs) appear ubiquitously on the common lattices. We first establish the destructive-interference (DI) scenario for the SLPSs, which is systematized by a point-group-symmetry interpretation. The examples on common one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices are then demonstrated. We also deduce the symmetry-protected robustness of SLPSs against further-neighbor hoppings. Moreover, the DI scenario can be generalized to the multi-SLP. The important effects on interaction-driven phases are studied by Hartree-Fock analysis.</description>

Abstract: Integration of 2D materials in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) marries the robustness of silicon-based materials with exceptional electrical controllability in 2D materials, drastically enhancing system performance which now is the key for many advanced applications in nanotechnology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and theoretically analyze a powerful on-chip graphene integrated NEMS device consisting of a hybrid graphene/silicon-nitride membrane with metallic leads that enables an extremely large static and dynamic parameter regulation. When a static voltage is applied to the leads, the force induced by the thermal expansion difference between the leads and the membrane results in ultra-wide frequency tuning, deformation (post-buckling transition) and regulation of mechanical properties. Moreover, by injecting an alternating voltage to the leads, we can excite the resonator vibrating even far beyond its linear regime without a complex and space consuming actuation system. Our results prove that the device is a compact integrated system possessing mechanical robustness, high controllability, and fast response. It not only expands the limit of the application range of NEMS devices but also pushes multidimensional nanomechanical resonators into working in the nonlinear regime.</description>

      <title>Observation of Electronic Viscous Dissipation in Graphene Magneto-thermal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic transport effectively describes the collective dynamics of fluids with well-defined thermodynamic quantities. With enhanced electron-electron interactions at elevated temperatures, the collective behavior of electrons in graphene with minimal impurities can be depicted as a hydrodynamic flow of charges. In this new regime, the well-known rules of Ohmic transport based on a single electron picture no longer apply, necessitating the consideration of collective electron dynamics. In particular, the hydrodynamic analogues of Joule heating and thermal transport require consideration of the viscous motion of the electron fluid, which has a direct impact on energy dissipation and heat generation by the fluidic motion of charge. In this work, we probe graphene hydrodynamics with thermal transport and find two distinct, qualitative signatures: thermal conductivity suppression below the Wiedemann-Franz value and viscous heating leading to magnetically-induced redistribution of temperature. We find these two effects are coincident in temperature and density, providing robust qualitative signatures of hydrodynamics, despite arising from two distinct aspects of this new regime: microscopic momentum conservation due to electron-electron scattering, and geometry-dependent viscous dissipation. Our results mark the first observation of viscous electronic heating in an electron fluid, providing insight for thermal management in electronic hydrodynamic devices and offering a new methodology for identifying hydrodynamic states in other systems.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric and thermal properties of the weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid phase of Luttinger semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.07459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the thermoelectric and thermal transport in the weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid phase of the Luttinger semimetals at zero doping, where the decay rate associated with the (strong) Coulomb interactions is much larger than the electron-impurity scattering rate. To this end, we implement the Mori-Zwanzig memory matrix method, that does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles in the system. We find that the thermal conductivity at zero electric field scales as $\bar{\kappa}\sim T^{-n}$ (with $0\lesssim n\lesssim 1)$ at low temperatures, whereas the thermoelectric coefficient has the temperature dependence given by $\alpha\sim T^{p}$ (with $1/2\lesssim p\lesssim 3/2)$. These unconventional properties turn out to be key signatures of this long sought-after non-Fermi liquid state in the Luttinger semimetals, which is expected to emerge in strongly correlated spin-orbit coupled materials like the pyrochlore iridates. Finally, our results indicate that these materials might be good candidates for achieving high figure of merit for thermoelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the transport properties of a Cooper pair splitter device composed of two-point electrodes in contact with a ferromagnetic/superconductor (F/S) junction constructed on the surface of a topological insulator (TI). For the pair potential in the S region, we consider s- and d-wave symmetries, while for the F region, we focus on a magnetization vector normal to the TI surface. Non-local transport along the F/S interface is mediated by chiral Majorana edge states, with chirality controlled by the polarization of the magnetization vector. We demonstrate that crossed Andreev reflections slowly decays with the separation of the electrodes in standard clean samples. Our system exhibits a maximum Cooper pair-splitting efficiency of 80% for a symmetrical voltage configuration, even in high-temperature superconductor devices.</description>

Abstract: The recently introduced topological heavy fermion model (THFM) provides a means for interpreting the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom of the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene as hybridization amidst highly dispersing topological conduction and weakly dispersing localized heavy fermions. In order to understand the Landau quantization of the ensuing electronic spectrum, a generalization of THFM to include the magnetic field B is desired, but currently missing. Here we provide a systematic derivation of the THFM in B and solve the resulting model to obtain the interacting Hofstadter spectra for single particle charged excitations. While naive minimal substitution within THFM fails to correctly account for the total number of magnetic subbands within the narrow band i.e. its total Chern number, our method -- based on projecting the light and heavy fermions onto the irreducible representations of the magnetic translation group -- reproduces the correct total Chern number. Analytical results presented here offer an intuitive understanding of the nature of the (strongly interacting) Hofstadter bands.</description>

Abstract: When reformulated as a resource theory, thermodynamics can analyze system behaviors in the single-shot regime. In this, the work required to implement state transitions is bounded by {\alpha}-Renyi divergences and so differs in identifying efficient operations compared to stochastic thermodynamics. Thus, a detailed understanding of the difference between stochastic and resource-theoretic thermodynamics is needed. To this end, we explore reversibility in the single-shot regime, generalizing the two-level work reservoirs used there to multi-level work reservoirs. This achieves reversibility in any transition in the single-shot regime. Building on this, we systematically develop multi-level work reservoirs in the nondissipation regime with and without catalysts. The resource-theoretic results show that two-level work reservoirs undershoot Landauer's bound, misleadingly implying energy dissipation during computation. In contrast, we demonstrate that multilevel work reservoirs achieve Landauer's bound while producing arbitrarily low entropy.</description>

Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

Abstract: The diversity and heterogeneity of biomarkers has made the development of general methods for single-step quantification of analytes difficult. For individual biomarkers, electrochemical methods that detect a conformational change in an affinity binder upon analyte binding have shown promise. However, because the conformational change must operate within a nanometer-scale working distance, an entirely new sensor, with a unique conformational change, must be developed for each analyte. Here, we demonstrate a modular electrochemical biosensor, built from DNA origami, which is easily adapted to diverse molecules by merely replacing its analyte binding domains. Instead of relying on a unique nanometer-scale movement of a single redox reporter, all sensor variants rely on the same 100-nanometer scale conformational change, which brings dozens of reporters close enough to a gold electrode surface that a signal can be measured via square wave voltammetry, a standard electrochemical technique. To validate our sensor's mechanism, we used single-stranded DNA as an analyte, and optimized the number of redox reporters and various linker lengths. Adaptation of the sensor to streptavidin and PDGF-BB analytes was achieved by simply adding biotin or anti-PDGF aptamers to appropriate DNA linkers. Geometrically-optimized streptavidin sensors exhibited signal gain and limit of detection markedly better than comparable reagentless electrochemical sensors. After use, the same sensors could be regenerated under mild conditions: performance was largely maintained over four cycles of DNA strand displacement and rehybridization. By leveraging the modularity of DNA nanostructures, our work provides a straightforward route to the single-step quantification of arbitrary nucleic acids and proteins.</description>

      <title>A Cooper-pair beam splitter as a feasible source of entangled electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of an entangled electron pair emerging from a system composed of two quantum dots attached to a superconductor Cooper pair beam splitter. We take into account three processes: Crossed Andreev Reflection, cotuneling, and Coulomb interaction. Together, these processes play crucial roles in the formation of entangled electronic states, with electrons being in spatially separated quantum dots. By using perturbation theory, we derive an analytical effective model that allows a simple picture of the intricate process behind the formation of the entangled state. Several entanglement quantifiers, including quantum mutual information, negativity, and concurrence, are employed to validate our findings. Finally, we define and calculate the covariance associated with the detection of two electrons, each originating from one of the quantum dots with a specific spin value. The time evolution of this observable follows the dynamics of all entanglement quantifiers, thus suggesting that it can be a useful tool for mapping the creation of entangled electrons in future applications within quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effects in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalous Hall effect arising from the altermagnetic order and spin-orbit interaction in doped FeSb$_2$. To investigate the anomalous transport, we have constructed a tight-binding model of FeSb$_2$. We separately considered the constraints imposed on the model parameters by the spin symmetry group and magnetic symmetry group at zero and finite spin-orbit interaction, respectively. The resulting model includes the effect of exchange splitting and is applicable at both zero and finite spin-orbit interaction. In the case of spin symmetry, the analysis covers the spin-only subgroup arising from collinear magnetism, as well as non-trivial symmetry elements. This allows us to explore changes in the hopping amplitudes as symmetry is reduced by spin-orbit interaction from the spin group to the magnetic group. While the anomalous Hall effect is forbidden by spin symmetry, it is allowed by the symmetries of the magnetic group. The intrinsic Hall conductivity is shown to vanish linearly with spin-orbit interaction. This non-analytic behavior is universal to altermagnets. It originates from the singularity of the Berry curvature localized along lines on a Fermi surface confined to symmetry planes. These planes host spin degeneracy protected by spin symmetry, which is lifted by spin-orbit interaction.</description>
