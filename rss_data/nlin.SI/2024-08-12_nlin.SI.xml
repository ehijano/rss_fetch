      <title>General rogue waves of infinite order: Exact properties, asymptotic behavior, and effective numerical computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a comprehensive analysis of a family of solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation called general rogue waves of infinite order. These solutions have recently been shown to describe various limit processes involving large-amplitude waves, and they have also appeared in some physical models not directly connected with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We establish the following key property of these solutions: they are all in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the spatial variable but they exhibit anomalously slow temporal decay. In this paper we define general rogue waves of infinite order, establish their basic exact and asymptotic properties, and provide computational tools for calculating them accurately.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>
