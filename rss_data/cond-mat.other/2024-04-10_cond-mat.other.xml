      <title>Robustness of topological magnons in disordered arrays of skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of disorder on the robustness of topological magnon states of two-dimensional ferromagnetic skyrmions is investigated. It is diagnosed by evaluating a real space topological invariant, the bosonic Bott index (BI). The disorder simultaneously breaks the axially symmetric shape and the crystalline ordering of the skyrmions array. The corresponding magnonic fluctuations and band spectrum are determined in terms of magnetic field and strength of disorder. We observe the closing of the existing band gaps as the individual skyrmions start to occupy random positions. The analysis reveals that topological states (TSs) persist beyond the perturbative limit when skyrmions reach the glassy phase. In addition, the localization of topologically protected edge states is weakened by the disordered skyrmion structure with increasing localization length. Our findings shed light on the physical understanding of the coexistence of disordered magnetic textures and their topological spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Transmission Through a Classical Analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been predicted that new physics and technology are enabled for quantum systems that suffer from partial decoherence, in the intermediate range between coherent quantum evolution and incoherent classical physics. We explore the asymmetric transmission through a classical analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) mesoscopic ring that supports a 3:1 asymmetry in transmission times, augmented with lossy features that act preferentially on the longer-lingering waves. Such a device is realized as a linear microwave graph utilizing a gyrator to create the 3:1 transmission time delay asymmetry, along with both homogeneous and localized losses, to produce an imbalance in wave transmission through the device. We demonstrate asymmetric transmission through the microwave-ring graph as a function of loss in both simulation and experiment, and in both the frequency- and time-domain. The microwave ring-graph results are compared to a numerical simulation representative of a class of recent models proposing dephasing-induced transport asymmetry in few-channel quantum systems, and parallels are noted.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus in finite local-depth circuits with long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians. On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local 2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training using the generalized toric code model.</description>
