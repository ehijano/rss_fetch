      <title>Counterdiabatic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a state of the art method for sampling from distributions with differentiable densities, but can converge slowly when applied to challenging multimodal problems. Running HMC with a time varying Hamiltonian, in order to interpolate from an initial tractable distribution to the target of interest, can address this problem. In conjunction with a weighting scheme to eliminate bias, this can be viewed as a special case of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling \cite{doucet2001introduction}. However, this approach can be inefficient, since it requires slow change between the initial and final distribution. Inspired by \cite{sels2017minimizing}, where a learned \emph{counterdiabatic} term added to the Hamiltonian allows for efficient quantum state preparation, we propose \emph{Counterdiabatic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo} (CHMC), which can be viewed as an SMC sampler with a more efficient kernel. We establish its relationship to recent proposals for accelerating gradient-based sampling with learned drift terms, and demonstrate on simple benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Conditional neural control variates for variance reduction in Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for inverse problems involves computing expectations under posterior distributions -- e.g., posterior means, variances, or predictive quantities -- typically via Monte Carlo (MC) estimation. When the quantity of interest varies significantly under the posterior, accurate estimates demand many samples -- a cost often prohibitive for partial differential equation-constrained problems. To address this challenge, we introduce conditional neural control variates, a modular method that learns amortized control variates from joint model-data samples to reduce the variance of MC estimators. To scale to high-dimensional problems, we leverage Stein's identity to design an architecture based on an ensemble of hierarchical coupling layers with tractable Jacobian trace computation. Training requires: (i) samples from the joint distribution of unknown parameters and observed data; and (ii) the posterior score function, which can be computed from physics-based likelihood evaluations, neural operator surrogates, or learned generative models such as conditional normalizing flows. Once trained, the control variates generalize across observations without retraining. We validate our approach on stylized and partial differential equation-constrained Darcy flow inverse problems, demonstrating substantial variance reduction, even when the analytical score is replaced by a learned surrogate.</description>

      <title>Efficient Uncoupled Learning Dynamics with $\tilde{O}\!\left(T^{-1/4}\right)$ Last-Iterate Convergence in Bilinear Saddle-Point Problems over Convex Sets under Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study last-iterate convergence of learning algorithms in bilinear saddle-point problems, a preferable notion of convergence that captures the day-to-day behavior of learning dynamics. We focus on the challenging setting where players select actions from compact convex sets and receive only bandit feedback. Our main contribution is the design of an uncoupled learning algorithm that guarantees last-iterate convergence to the Nash equilibrium with high probability. We establish a convergence rate of $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$ up to polynomial factors in problem parameters. Crucially, our proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, requiring only an efficient linear optimization oracle over the players' compact action sets. The algorithm is obtained by combining techniques from experimental design and the classic Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework, with a carefully chosen regularizer function tailored to the geometry of the action set of each learner.</description>

      <title>ConformalHDC: Uncertainty-Aware Hyperdimensional Computing with Application to Neural Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) offers a computationally efficient paradigm for neuromorphic learning. Yet, it lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification, leading to open decision boundaries and, consequently, vulnerability to outliers, adversarial perturbations, and out-of-distribution inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce ConformalHDC, a unified framework that combines the statistical guarantees of conformal prediction with the computational efficiency of HDC. For this framework, we propose two complementary variations. First, the set-valued formulation provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees. Using carefully designed conformity scores, it forms enclosed decision boundaries that improve robustness to non-conforming inputs. Second, the point-valued formulation leverages the same conformity scores to produce a single prediction when desired, potentially improving accuracy over traditional HDC by accounting for class interactions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed framework through evaluations on multiple real-world datasets. In particular, we apply our method to the challenging problem of decoding non-spatial stimulus information from the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons recorded as subjects performed a sequence memory task. Our results show that ConformalHDC not only accurately decodes the stimulus information represented in the neural activity data, but also provides rigorous uncertainty estimates and correctly abstains when presented with data from other behavioral states. Overall, these capabilities position the framework as a reliable, uncertainty-aware foundation for neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference after Directionally Stable Adaptive Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inference on scalar-valued pathwise differentiable targets after adaptive data collection, such as a bandit algorithm. We introduce a novel target-specific condition, directional stability, which is strictly weaker than previously imposed target-agnostic stability conditions. Under directional stability, we show that estimators that would have been efficient under i.i.d. data remain asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient when computed from adaptively collected trajectories. The canonical gradient has a martingale form, and directional stability guarantees stabilization of its predictable quadratic variation, enabling high-dimensional asymptotic normality. We characterize efficiency using a convolution theorem for the adaptive-data setting, and give a condition under which the one-step estimator attains the efficiency bound. We verify directional stability for LinUCB, yielding the first semiparametric efficiency guarantee for a regular scalar target under LinUCB sampling.</description>

      <title>Global Sequential Testing for Multi-Stream Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across many risk-sensitive areas, it is critical to continuously audit the performance of machine learning systems and detect any unusual behavior quickly. This can be modeled as a sequential hypothesis testing problem with $k$ incoming streams of data and a global null hypothesis that asserts that the system is working as expected across all $k$ streams. The standard global test employs a Bonferroni correction and has an expected stopping time bound of $O\left(\ln\frac{k}{\alpha}\right)$ when $k$ is large and the significance level of the test, $\alpha$, is small. In this work, we construct new sequential tests by using ideas of merging test martingales with different trade-offs in expected stopping times under different, sparse or dense alternative hypotheses. We further derive a new, balanced test that achieves an improved expected stopping time bound that matches Bonferroni's in the sparse setting but that naturally results in $O\left(\frac{1}{k}\ln\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)$ under a dense alternative. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed tests on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>A Researcher's Guide to Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This guide develops high-probability regret bounds for empirical risk minimization (ERM). The presentation is modular: we state broadly applicable guarantees under high-level conditions and give tools for verifying them for specific losses and function classes. We emphasize that many ERM rate derivations can be organized around a three-step recipe -- a basic inequality, a uniform local concentration bound, and a fixed-point argument -- which yields regret bounds in terms of a critical radius, defined via localized Rademacher complexity, under a mild Bernstein-type variance--risk condition. To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/H\"older, and bounded-variation classes.
  We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy. We also treat the in-sample regime, where nuisances and the ERM are fit on the same data, deriving regret bounds and giving sufficient conditions for fast rates.</description>

      <title>Fair Model-based Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of fair clustering is to find clusters such that the proportion of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, etc.) in each cluster is similar to that of the entire dataset. Various fair clustering algorithms have been proposed that modify standard K-means clustering to satisfy a given fairness constraint. A critical limitation of several existing fair clustering algorithms is that the number of parameters to be learned is proportional to the sample size because the cluster assignment of each datum should be optimized simultaneously with the cluster center, and thus scaling up the algorithms is difficult. In this paper, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a finite mixture model, called Fair Model-based Clustering (FMC). A main advantage of FMC is that the number of learnable parameters is independent of the sample size and thus can be scaled up easily. In particular, mini-batch learning is possible to obtain clusters that are approximately fair. Moreover, FMC can be applied to non-metric data (e.g., categorical data) as long as the likelihood is well-defined. Theoretical and empirical justifications for the superiority of the proposed algorithm are provided.</description>

      <title>Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Latent Class Models with Ordinal Categorical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinal categorical data are widely collected in psychology, education, and other social sciences, appearing commonly in questionnaires, assessments, and surveys. Latent class models provide a flexible framework for uncovering unobserved heterogeneity by grouping individuals into homogeneous classes based on their response patterns. A fundamental challenge in applying these models is determining the number of latent classes, which is unknown and must be inferred from data. In this paper, we propose one test statistic for this problem. The test statistic centers the largest singular value of a normalized residual matrix by a simple sample-size adjustment. Under the null hypothesis that the candidate number of latent classes is correct, its upper bound converges to zero in probability. Under an under-fitted alternative, the statistic itself exceeds a fixed positive constant with probability approaching one. This sharp dichotomous behavior of the test statistic yields two sequential testing algorithms that consistently estimate the true number of latent classes. Extensive experimental studies confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate their accuracy and reliability in determining the number of latent classes.</description>

      <title>Scalable Kernel-Based Distances for Statistical Inference and Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing, comparing, and measuring the distance between probability distributions is a key task in computational statistics and machine learning. The choice of representation and the associated distance determine properties of the methods in which they are used: for example, certain distances can allow one to encode robustness or smoothness of the problem. Kernel methods offer flexible and rich Hilbert space representations of distributions that allow the modeller to enforce properties through the choice of kernel, and estimate associated distances at efficient nonparametric rates. In particular, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a kernel-based distance constructed by comparing Hilbert space mean functions, has received significant attention due to its computational tractability and is favoured by practitioners.
  In this thesis, we conduct a thorough study of kernel-based distances with a focus on efficient computation, with core contributions in Chapters 3 to 6. Part I of the thesis is focused on the MMD, specifically on improved MMD estimation. In Chapter 3 we propose a theoretically sound, improved estimator for MMD in simulation-based inference. Then, in Chapter 4, we propose an MMD-based estimator for conditional expectations, a ubiquitous task in statistical computation. Closing Part I, in Chapter 5 we study the problem of calibration when MMD is applied to the task of integration.
  In Part II, motivated by the recent developments in kernel embeddings beyond the mean, we introduce a family of novel kernel-based discrepancies: kernel quantile discrepancies. These address some of the pitfalls of MMD, and are shown through both theoretical results and an empirical study to offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast approximations. We conclude with a discussion on broader lessons and future work emerging from the thesis.</description>

      <title>Probing the Geometry of Diffusion Models with the String Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the geometry of learned distributions is fundamental to improving and interpreting diffusion models, yet systematic tools for exploring their landscape remain limited. Standard latent-space interpolations fail to respect the structure of the learned distribution, often traversing low-density regions. We introduce a framework based on the string method that computes continuous paths between samples by evolving curves under the learned score function. Operating on pretrained models without retraining, our approach interpolates between three regimes: pure generative transport, which yields continuous sample paths; gradient-dominated dynamics, which recover minimum energy paths (MEPs); and finite-temperature string dynamics, which compute principal curves -- self-consistent paths that balance energy and entropy. We demonstrate that the choice of regime matters in practice. For image diffusion models, MEPs contain high-likelihood but unrealistic ''cartoon'' images, confirming prior observations that likelihood maxima appear unrealistic; principal curves instead yield realistic morphing sequences despite lower likelihood. For protein structure prediction, our method computes transition pathways between metastable conformers directly from models trained on static structures, yielding paths with physically plausible intermediates. Together, these results establish the string method as a principled tool for probing the modal structure of diffusion models -- identifying modes, characterizing barriers, and mapping connectivity in complex learned distributions.</description>

      <title>Group Orthogonalized Policy Optimization:Group Policy Optimization as Orthogonal Projection in Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Group Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (GOPO), a new alignment algorithm for large language models derived from the geometry of Hilbert function spaces. Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition &lt;v, 1&gt; = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = &lt;g, v&gt; - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v &gt;= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau.</description>

      <title>Neural network optimization strategies and the topography of the loss landscape</title>

Abstract: Neural networks are trained by optimizing multi-dimensional sets of fitting parameters on non-convex loss landscapes. Low-loss regions of the landscapes correspond to the parameter sets that perform well on the training data. A key issue in machine learning is the performance of trained neural networks on previously unseen test data. Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - a non-convex global optimization algorithm which relies only on the gradient of the objective function. We contrast SGD solutions with those obtained via a non-stochastic quasi-Newton method, which utilizes curvature information to determine step direction and Golden Section Search to choose step size. We use several computational tools to investigate neural network parameters obtained by these two optimization methods, including kernel Principal Component Analysis and a novel, general-purpose algorithm for finding low-height paths between pairs of points on loss or energy landscapes, FourierPathFinder. We find that the choice of the optimizer profoundly affects the nature of the resulting solutions. SGD solutions tend to be separated by lower barriers than quasi-Newton solutions, even if both sets of solutions are regularized by early stopping to ensure adequate performance on test data. When allowed to fit extensively on the training data, quasi-Newton solutions occupy deeper minima on the loss landscapes that are not reached by SGD. These solutions are less generalizable to the test data however. Overall, SGD explores smooth basins of attraction, while quasi-Newton optimization is capable of finding deeper, more isolated minima that are more spread out in the parameter space. Our findings help understand both the topography of the loss landscapes and the fundamental role of landscape exploration strategies in creating robust, transferrable neural network models.</description>

Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Reliability Certification for AI Agents via Self-Consistency Sampling and Conformal Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a black-box AI system and a task, at what confidence level can a practitioner trust the system's output? We answer with a reliability level -- a single number per system-task pair, derived from self-consistency sampling and conformal calibration, that serves as a black-box deployment gate with exact, finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. Self-consistency sampling reduces uncertainty exponentially; conformal calibration guarantees correctness within 1/(n+1) of the target level, regardless of the system's errors -- made transparently visible through larger answer sets for harder questions. Weaker models earn lower reliability levels (not accuracy -- see Definition 2.4): GPT-4.1 earns 94.6% on GSM8K and 96.8% on TruthfulQA, while GPT-4.1-nano earns 89.8% on GSM8K and 66.5% on MMLU. We validate across five benchmarks, five models from three families, and both synthetic and real data. Conditional coverage on solvable items exceeds 0.93 across all configurations; sequential stopping reduces API costs by around 50%.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently producing, in an online fashion, generative models of scalar, multiclass, and vector-valued outcomes that cannot be falsified on the basis of the observed data and a pre-specified collection of computational tests. Our contributions are twofold. First, we expand on connections between online high-dimensional multicalibration with respect to an RKHS and recent advances in expected variational inequality problems, enabling efficient algorithms for the former. We then apply this algorithmic machinery to the problem of outcome indistinguishability. Our procedure, Defensive Generation, is the first to efficiently produce online outcome indistinguishable generative models of non-Bernoulli outcomes that are unfalsifiable with respect to infinite classes of tests, including those that examine higher-order moments of the generated distributions. Furthermore, our method runs in near-linear time in the number of samples and achieves the optimal, vanishing T^{-1/2} rate for generation error.</description>

      <title>Generative Bayesian Computation as a Scalable Alternative to Gaussian Process Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) surrogates are the default tool for emulating expensive computer experiments, but cubic cost, stationarity assumptions, and Gaussian predictive distributions limit their reach. We propose Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQNs) as a surrogate framework that targets all three limitations. GBC learns the full conditional quantile function from input--output pairs; at test time, a single forward pass per quantile level produces draws from the predictive distribution.
  Across fourteen benchmarks we compare GBC to four GP-based methods. GBC improves CRPS by 11--26\% on piecewise jump-process benchmarks, by 14\% on a ten-dimensional Friedman function, and scales linearly to 90,000 training points where dense-covariance GPs are infeasible. A boundary-augmented variant matches or outperforms Modular Jump GPs on two-dimensional jump datasets (up to 46\% CRPS improvement). In active learning, a randomized-prior IQN ensemble achieves nearly three times lower RMSE than deep GP active learning on Rocket LGBB. Overall, GBC records a favorable point estimate in 12 of 14 comparisons. GPs retain an edge on smooth surfaces where their smoothness prior provides effective regularization.</description>

      <title>Effects of Training Data Quality on Classifier Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe extensive numerical experiments assessing and quantifying how classifier performance depends on the quality of the training data, a frequently neglected component of the analysis of classifiers.
  More specifically, in the scientific context of metagenomic assembly of short DNA reads into "contigs," we examine the effects of degrading the quality of the training data by multiple mechanisms, and for four classifiers -- Bayes classifiers, neural nets, partition models and random forests. We investigate both individual behavior and congruence among the classifiers. We find breakdown-like behavior that holds for all four classifiers, as degradation increases and they move from being mostly correct to only coincidentally correct, because they are wrong in the same way. In the process, a picture of spatial heterogeneity emerges: as the training data move farther from analysis data, classifier decisions degenerate, the boundary becomes less dense, and congruence increases.</description>

      <title>How many asymmetric communities are there in multi-layer directed networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the asymmetric numbers of communities in multi-layer directed networks is a challenging problem due to the multi-layer structures and inherent directional asymmetry, leading to possibly different numbers of sender and receiver communities. This work addresses this issue under the multi-layer stochastic co-block model, a model for multi-layer directed networks with distinct community structures in sending and receiving sides, by proposing a novel goodness-of-fit test. The test statistic relies on the deviation of the largest singular value of an aggregated normalized residual matrix from the constant 2. The test statistic exhibits a sharp dichotomy: Under the null hypothesis of correct model specification, its upper bound converges to zero with high probability; under underfitting, the test statistic itself diverges to infinity. With this property, we develop a sequential testing procedure that searches through candidate pairs of sender and receiver community numbers in a lexicographic order. The process stops at the smallest such pair where the test statistic drops below a decaying threshold. For robustness, we also propose a ratio-based variant algorithm, which detects sharp changes in the sequence of test statistics by comparing consecutive candidates. Both methods are proven to consistently determine the true numbers of sender and receiver communities under the multi-layer stochastic co-block model.</description>

      <title>Learning Complex Physical Regimes via Coverage-oriented Uncertainty Quantification: An application to the Critical Heat Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in scientific machine learning (ML) is the correct representation of physical systems governed by multi-regime behaviours. In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of RLHF under Reward Shift and Clipped KL Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.</description>

      <title>Learning Unknown Interdependencies for Decentralized Root Cause Analysis in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in networked industrial systems, such as supply chains and power networks, is notoriously difficult due to unknown and dynamically evolving interdependencies among geographically distributed clients. These clients represent heterogeneous physical processes and industrial assets equipped with sensors that generate large volumes of nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous IoT data. Classical RCA methods require partial or full knowledge of the system's dependency graph, which is rarely available in these complex networks. While federated learning (FL) offers a natural framework for decentralized settings, most existing FL methods assume homogeneous feature spaces and retrainable client models. These assumptions are not compatible with our problem setting. Different clients have different data features and often run fixed, proprietary models that cannot be modified. This paper presents a federated cross-client interdependency learning methodology for feature-partitioned, nonlinear time-series data, without requiring access to raw sensor streams or modifying proprietary client models. Each proprietary local client model is augmented with a Machine Learning (ML) model that encodes cross-client interdependencies. These ML models are coordinated via a global server that enforces representation consistency while preserving privacy through calibrated differential privacy noise. RCA is performed using model residuals and anomaly flags. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and validate our approach on extensive simulations and a real-world industrial cybersecurity dataset.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Generative Adversarial Networks via Gaussian Approximation for Tabular Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been used in many studies to synthesise mixed tabular data. Conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) have been the most popular variant but struggle to effectively navigate the risk-utility trade-off. Bayesian GAN have received less attention for tabular data, but have been explored with unstructured data such as images and text. The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN (GACTGAN), an integration of the Bayesian posterior approximation technique using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) within the CTGAN generator to synthesise tabular data, reducing computational overhead after the training phase. We demonstrate that GACTGAN yields better synthetic data compared to CTGAN, achieving better preservation of tabular structure and inferential statistics with less privacy risk. These results highlight GACTGAN as a simpler, effective implementation of Bayesian tabular synthesis.</description>

      <title>Neural solver for Wasserstein Geodesics and optimal transport dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the machine learning community has increasingly embraced the optimal transport (OT) framework for modeling distributional relationships. In this work, we introduce a sample-based neural solver for computing the Wasserstein geodesic between a source and target distribution, along with the associated velocity field. Building on the dynamical formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, we recast the constrained optimization as a minimax problem, using deep neural networks to approximate the relevant functions. This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field. The framework is flexible and readily extends to general cost functions, including the commonly used quadratic cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Coarsening Bias from Variable Discretization in Causal Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of causal effect functionals requires integration over conditional densities of continuous variables, as in mediation effects and nonparametric identification in causal graphical models. Estimating such densities and evaluating the resulting integrals can be statistically and computationally demanding. A common workaround is to discretize the variable and replace integrals with finite sums. Although convenient, discretization alters the population-level functional and can induce non-negligible approximation bias, even under correct identification. Under smoothness conditions, we show that this coarsening bias is first order in the bin width and arises at the level of the target functional, distinct from statistical estimation error. We propose a simple bias-reduced functional that evaluates the outcome regression at within-bin conditional means, eliminating the leading term and yielding a second-order approximation error. We derive plug-in and one-step estimators for the bias-reduced functional. Simulations demonstrate substantial bias reduction and near-nominal confidence interval coverage, even under coarse binning. Our results provide a simple framework for controlling the impact of variable discretization on parameter approximation and estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that applying a fixed-effect multiple linear regression (MLR) model to an overparameterized dataset is mathematically equivalent to fitting a hyper-curve parameterized by a single scalar. This reformulation shifts the focus from global coefficients to individual predictors, allowing each to be modeled as a function of a common parameter. We prove that this overparameterized linear framework can yield exact predictions even when the underlying data contains nonlinear dependencies that violate classical linear assumptions. By employing parameterization in terms of the dependent variable and a monomial basis, we validate this approach on both synthetic and experimental datasets. Our results show that the hyper-curve perspective provides a robust framework for regularizing problems with noisy predictors and offers a systematic method for identifying and removing 'improper' predictors that degrade model generalizability.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Effective LLMs with Multi-Boolean Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce the complexity of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches fall into post-training binarization, which is simple but causes severe performance loss, and training-aware methods, which depend on full-precision latent weights, adding complexity and limiting efficiency. We propose a novel framework that represents LLMs with multi-kernel Boolean parameters and, for the first time, enables direct finetuning LMMs in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for latent weights. This enhances representational capacity and dramatically reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs show our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in single-layer attention-style models, where tokens interact through a weight matrix and a nonlinear activation function. We prove that the minimax rate is $M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$, where $M$ is the sample size and $\beta$ is the H\"older smoothness of the activation function. Importantly, this rate is independent of the embedding dimension $d$, the number of tokens $N$, and the rank $r$ of the weight matrix, provided that $rd \le (M/\log M)^{\frac{1}{2\beta+1}}$. These results highlight a fundamental statistical efficiency of attention-style models, even when the weight matrix and activation are not separately identifiable, and provide a theoretical understanding of attention mechanisms and guidance on training.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating highly multimodal datasets with explicitly calculable mutual information (MI) between modalities. This enables the construction of benchmark datasets that provide a novel testbed for systematic studies of mutual information estimators and multimodal self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques. Our framework constructs realistic datasets with known MI using a flow-based generative model and a structured causal framework for generating correlated latent variables. We benchmark a suite of MI estimators on datasets with varying ground truth MI values and verify that regression performance improves as the MI increases between input modalities and the target value. Finally, we describe how our framework can be applied to contexts including multi-detector astrophysics and SSL studies in the highly multimodal regime.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Learning Rate Transfer under $\mu$P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first proof of learning rate transfer with width in a linear multi-layer perceptron (MLP) parametrized with $\mu$P, a neural network parameterization designed to ``maximize'' feature learning in the infinite-width limit. We show that under $\mu P$, the optimal learning rate converges to a \emph{non-zero constant} as width goes to infinity, providing a theoretical explanation to learning rate transfer. In contrast, we show that this property fails to hold under alternative parametrizations such as Standard Parametrization (SP) and Neural Tangent Parametrization (NTP). We provide intuitive proofs and support the theoretical findings with extensive empirical results.</description>

      <title>Private Blind Model Averaging - Distributed, Non-interactive, and Convergent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed differentially private learning techniques enable a large number of users to jointly learn a model without having to first centrally collect the training data. At the same time, neither the communication between the users nor the resulting model shall leak information about the training data. This kind of learning technique can be deployed to edge devices if it can be scaled up to a large number of users, particularly if the communication is reduced to a minimum: no interaction, i.e., each party only sends a single message. The best previously known methods are based on gradient averaging, which inherently requires many synchronization rounds. A promising non-interactive alternative to gradient averaging relies on so-called output perturbation: each user first locally finishes training and then submits its model for secure averaging without further synchronization. We analyze this paradigm, which we coin blind model averaging (BlindAvg), in the setting of convex and smooth empirical risk minimization (ERM) like a support vector machine (SVM). While the required noise scale is asymptotically the same as in the centralized setting, it is not well understood how close BlindAvg comes to centralized learning, i.e., its utility cost. We characterize and boost the privacy-utility tradeoff of BlindAvg with two contributions: First, we prove that BlindAvg converges towards the centralized setting for a sufficiently strong L2-regularization for a non-smooth SVM learner. Second, we introduce the novel differentially private convex and smooth ERM learner SoftmaxReg that has a better privacy-utility tradeoff than an SVM in a multi-class setting. We evaluate our findings on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Federated EMNIST) and provide an ablation in an artificially extreme non-IID scenario.</description>

      <title>Towards a Fairer Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent critical need to study fairness and bias in machine learning (ML) algorithms. Since there is clearly no one-size-fits-all solution to fairness, ML methods should be developed alongside bias mitigation strategies that are practical and approachable to the practitioner. Motivated by recent work on ``fair" PCA, here we consider the more challenging method of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as both a showcasing example and a method that is important in its own right for both topic modeling tasks and feature extraction for other ML tasks. We demonstrate that a modification of the objective function, by using a min-max formulation, may \textit{sometimes} be able to offer an improvement in fairness for groups in the population. We derive two methods for the objective minimization, a multiplicative update rule as well as an alternating minimization scheme, and discuss implementation practicalities. We include a suite of synthetic and real experiments that show how the method may improve fairness while also highlighting the important fact that this may sometime increase error for some individuals and fairness is not a rigid definition and method choice should strongly depend on the application at hand.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Benchmark for Electrocardiogram Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram~(ECG), a key bioelectrical time-series signal, is crucial for assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various diseases. Given its time-series format, ECG data is often incorporated into pre-training datasets for large-scale time-series model training. However, existing studies often overlook its unique characteristics and specialized downstream applications, which differ significantly from other time-series data, leading to an incomplete understanding of its properties. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of ECG signals and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which includes (1) categorizing its downstream applications into four distinct evaluation tasks, (2) identifying limitations in traditional evaluation metrics for ECG analysis, and introducing a novel metric; (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art time-series models and proposing a new architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is comprehensive and robust. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and model architecture, which establish a solid foundation for advancing research in ECG signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the generalization error for deep gradient flow methods for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>The generalized underlap coefficient with an application in clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying distributional separation across groups is fundamental in statistical learning and scientific discovery, yet most classical discrepancy measures are tailored to two-group comparisons. We generalize the underlap coefficient (UNL), a multi-group separation measure, to multivariate variables. We establish key properties of the UNL and provide an explicit connection to total variation. We further interpret the UNL as a dependence measure between a group label and variables of interest and compare it with mutual information. We propose an efficient importance sampling estimator of the UNL that can be combined with flexible density estimators. The utility of the UNL for assessing partition-covariate dependence in clustering is highlighted in detail, where it is particularly useful for evaluating whether the latent group structure can be explained by specific covariates. Finally we illustrate the application of the UNL in clustering using two real world datasets.</description>
