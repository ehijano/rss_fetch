      <title>Satellite Streak Brightness Variation with Orbit Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the apparent optical brightness of satellite streaks in ground-based observatory cameras as the orbit height is varied. This is done via simulations. Several factors are in play: the range to the satellite, satellite size and geometry, the diameter of the telescope aperture, and the angular velocity of the satellite image as it streaks across the camera's focal plane. For a large telescope aperture, a satellite in a lower orbit becomes out-of-focus in a camera focused at infinity. In the case of Rubin Observatory's LSSTCam, we find that these factors nearly cancel as a large satellite is moved from an orbit at 550 km down to 350 km.</description>

      <title>VSTPOL: making the VST a large survey telescope for optical polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the start of operations in 2011, the VLT Survey Telescope (VST) has been one of the most efficient wide-field imagers in the optical bands. However, in the next years the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will be a game-changer in this field. Hence, the timing is appropriate for specializing the VST with additions that can make it unique in well-defined scientific cases. VSTPOL is a project that aims to provide the addition of wide-field polarimetric capabilities to the VST telescope, making it the first large survey telescope for linear optical polarimetry. Actually, while there are quite a number of optical telescopes, the telescopes providing polarimetric instrumentation are just a few. The number of relatively large mirror polarimetric telescopes is small, although they would be specifically needed e.g. to support many science cases of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) that, in the southern hemisphere, is co-located with the VST. The VST telescope is equipped with a single instrument, the OmegaCAM wide-field imaging camera operating in the visible bands with a field of view of 1$^\circ\times1^\circ$. The polarimetric mode will be implemented through the insertion of a large rotatable polarizer installed on the field-corrector optics, which will be exchangeable with the non-polarimetric corrector optics. The limiting polarimetric systematic errors due to variable atmospheric conditions and instrumental polarization can be corrected down to a level of $\sim10^{-3}$ by leveraging the large amount of unpolarized stars within each field-of-view. By the user point of view, VSTPOL will be an additional mode for the VST wide-field imaging camera.</description>

      <title>Brightness Characteristics of the Qianfan Satellites and Evidence That Some Are Tumbling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean apparent magnitude of the Qianfan satellites is 5.76 +/- 0.04, while the mean of magnitudes adjusted to a distance of 1,000 km is 5.24 +/- 0.04, based on 1,161 observations. Light curves of several spacecraft display rapid periodic fluctuations which indicate that they are tumbling. Nearly all of the non-tumbling satellite observations can be modeled with diffusely reflecting, Earth-facing surfaces. The Qianfan constellation will impact astronomical research and aesthetic appreciation of the night sky unless their brightness is mitigated.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Hosting a Virtual Conference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual meetings have long been the outcast of scientific interaction. For many of us, the COVID-19 pandemic has only strengthened that sentiment as countless Zoom meetings have left us bored and exhausted. But remote conferences do not have to be negative experiences. If well designed, they have some distinct advantages over conventional in-person meetings, including universal access, longevity of content, as well as minimal costs and carbon footprint. This article details our experiences as organizers of a successful fully virtual scientific conference, the KITP program "Fundamentals of Gaseous Halos" hosted over 8 weeks in winter 2021. Herein, we provide detailed recommendations on planning and optimization of remote meetings, with application to traditional in-person events as well. We hope these suggestions will assist organizers of future virtual conferences and workshops.</description>

      <title>Mapping neutral islands during end stages of reionization with photometric intergalactic medium tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the first generation of luminous sources in our Universe emitted ionizing photons that almost completely ionized the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). The growth of ionized bubbles and the persistence of neutral islands within the IGM hold vital clues to understanding the morphology and timeline of cosmic reionization. We explore the potential of photometric IGM tomography using deep narrow-band (NB) imaging to observe the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission in background galaxies with the Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC). Based on our simulations, we find that the currently available NB filter is suitable for mapping the IGM at $z\simeq 5.7$, corresponding to the late stages of reionization. Our findings indicate that over $\sim$500 background galaxies are needed to accurately reconstruct the IGM at scales greater than 200 Mpc, achieving more than 40 per cent correlation with the true distribution. This technique can help detect final remaining neutral islands that span more than 20 Mpc lengths. Using the superpixel method built to identify physical patterns in noisy image data, we find that the neutral island size distribution can be recovered with an accuracy of $\sim$0.3 dex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these reconstructed maps are correlated with the galaxy distribution and anti-correlated with the cosmological 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the IGM. Lastly, we find that these reconstructed maps are anti-correlated with the patchy optical depth to the cosmic microwave background. As such, multiple measurements can be employed for confirmed detection of neutral islands during the end stages.</description>

      <title>Multitaper magnitude-squared coherence for time series with missing data: Understanding oscillatory processes traced by multiple observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore the hypothesis of a common source of variability in two time series, observers may estimate the magnitude-squared coherence (MSC), which is a frequency-domain view of the cross correlation. For time series that do not have uniform observing cadence, MSC can be estimated using Welch's overlapping segment averaging. However, multitaper has superior statistical properties to Welch's method in terms of the tradeoff between bias, variance, and bandwidth. The classical multitaper technique has recently been extended to accommodate time series with underlying uniform observing cadence from which some observations are missing. This situation is common for solar and geomagnetic datasets, which may have gaps due to breaks in satellite coverage, instrument downtime, or poor observing conditions. We demonstrate the scientific use of missing-data multitaper magnitude-squared coherence by detecting known solar mid-term oscillations in simultaneous, missing-data time series of solar Lyman $\alpha$ flux and geomagnetic Disturbance Storm Time index. Due to their superior statistical properties, we recommend that multitaper methods be used for all heliospheric time series with underlying uniform observing cadence.</description>

      <title>EXP: a Python/C++ package for basis function expansion methods in galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the public release of EXP, a basis function expansion C++ library and Python package for running N-body galactic simulations and dynamical discovery. EXP grew out of the need for methodology that seamlessly connects theoretical descriptions of dynamics, N-body simulations, and compact descriptions of observed data. EXP decomposes a galaxy into multiple bases for a variety of scales and geometries and is thus able to represent arbitrarily complex simulations with many components (e.g., disk, bulge, dark matter halo, satellites). pyEXP provides a full Python interface to the EXP C++ libraries. Example workflows based on previously published work are available and distributed as accompanying examples and tutorials. The examples and tutorials flatten the learning curve for adopting basis function expansion tools to generate and analyze the significance of coefficients and discover dynamical relationships using time series analysis. The current release uses a powerful, non-parametric technique for time series analysis that decomposes basis function expansion coefficients into interpretable components without assuming a specific model structure. This enables the automated discovery of dynamical signals from simulations. We provide a full online manual hosted by Read the Docs.</description>

      <title>The CHIMERAS Project: Design Framework for the Collisionless HIgh-beta Magnetized Experiment Researching Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the near-Earth solar wind to the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, collisionless, high-beta, magnetized plasmas pervade our universe. Energy and momentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of plasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the underlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated by a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of kinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or multi-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft missions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al. 2020, 2023). Meanwhile, existing laboratory devices struggle to produce the collisionless, high ion beta ($\beta_i \gtrsim 1$), magnetized plasmas across the range of scales necessary to address these problems. As envisioned in recent community planning documents (Carter et al. 2020; Milchberg and Scime 2020; Baalrud et al. 2020; Dorfman et al. 2023; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2024, it is therefore important to build a next generation laboratory facility to create a $\beta_i \gtrsim 1$, collisionless, magnetized plasma in the laboratory for the first time. A Working Group has been formed and is actively defining the necessary technical requirements to move the facility towards a construction-ready state. Recent progress includes the development of target parameters and diagnostic requirements as well as the identification of a need for source-target device geometry. As the working group is already leading to new synergies across the community, we anticipate a broad community of users funded by a variety of federal agencies (including NASA, DOE, and NSF) to make copious use of the future facility.</description>

      <title>Implementing Errors on Errors: Bayesian vs Frequentist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When combining apparently inconsistent experimental results, one often implements errors on errors. The Particle Data Group's phenomenological prescription offers a practical solution but lacks a firm theoretical foundation. To address this, D'Agostini and Cowan have proposed Bayesian and frequentist approaches, respectively, both introducing gamma-distributed auxiliary variables to model uncertainty in quoted errors. In this Letter, we show that these two formulations admit a parameter-by-parameter correspondence, and are structurally equivalent. This identification clarifies how Bayesian prior choices can be interpreted in terms of frequentist sampling assumptions, providing a unified probabilistic framework for modeling uncertainty in quoted variances.</description>

      <title>Adjusting optical cavity birefringence with wavelength tunable laser for axion searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions have attracted attention promising candidates for dark matter (DM). Although axions have been intensively searched for, they have not been observed yet. Recently, novel experiments to search for axion DM have been proposed that use optical cavities to amplify polarization rotation of laser light induced by the axion-photon interaction. One such experiment employs a ring cavity composed of four mirrors. However, its sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling $\gag$ in the low axion mass region is limited due to the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the sensitivity using zero-phase shift mirrors and a wavelength tunable laser. Moreover, the laser makes it easier to scan the high axion mass region by tuning the reflection phase difference between s- and p-polarizations. We experimentally confirmed that the phase difference generated upon reflection on a zero phase shift mirror satisfies the requirement of $8.6 \times 10^{-3}~\si{deg}$, which corresponds to the half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the p-polarization with the mirror fixed on a folded cavity and a wavelength tunable laser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SUPerconduction AXion search experiment (Supax) is a haloscope designed to probe axion-like particles (ALPs) as candidates for dark matter and solutions to the strong CP problem. ALPs are predicted to couple to photons, allowing their detection through resonant conversion in electromagnetic cavities placed within strong magnetic fields. \Supax employs a 12 T magnetic field and tunable superconducting cavities with resonance frequencies ranging from 2\,GHz to 7.2\,GHz, enabling the exploration of axion masses between 8\,$\mu$eV and 30\,$\mu$eV. The tuning mechanism, based on piezo motors and gas-pressure regulation, allows for simultaneous scanning of up to three frequencies, significantly improving search efficiency. This paper presents the technical design of the Supax experiment, preliminary R\&amp;D efforts, and results from prototype experiments. In particular, we exclude dark photons with masses around $35\,\mu$eV with a kinetic mixing parameter $\chi &gt; 5\cdot 10^{-14}$, i.e. a region of parameter space which has not been previously explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band.</description>

      <title>Modeling Foreground Spatial Variations in 21 cm Gaussian Process Component Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have been extensively utilized as nonparametric models for component separation in 21 cm data analyses. This exploits the distinct spectral behavior of the cosmological and foreground signals, which are modeled through the GP covariance kernel. Previous approaches have employed a global GP kernel along all lines of sight (LoS). In this work, we study Bayesian approaches that allow for spatial variations in foreground kernel parameters, testing them against simulated HI intensity mapping observations. We consider a no-pooling (NP) model, which treats each LoS independently by fitting for separate covariance kernels, and a hierarchical Gaussian Process (HGP) model that allows for variation in kernel parameters between different LoS, regularized through a global hyperprior. We find that accounting for spatial variations in the GP kernel parameters results in a significant improvement in cosmological signal recovery, achieving up to a 30% reduction in the standard deviation of the residual distribution and improved model predictive performance. Allowing for spatial variations in GP kernel parameters also improves the recovery of the HI power spectra and wavelet scattering transform coefficients. Whilst the NP model achieves superior recovery as measured by the residual distribution, it demands extensive computational resources, faces formidable convergence challenges, and is prone to overfitting. Conversely, the HGP model strikes a balance between the accuracy and robustness of the signal recovery. Further improvements to the HGP model will require more physically motivated modeling of foreground spatial variations.</description>

      <title>On the spatial distribution of the Large-Scale structure: An Unsupervised search for Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use machine learning methods to search for parity violations in the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe, motivated by recent claims of chirality detection using the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF), which would suggest new physics during the epoch of inflation. This work seeks to reproduce these claims using methods originating from high energy collider analyses. Our machine learning methods optimise some underlying parity odd function of the data, and use it to evaluate the parity odd fraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of these methods and then apply them to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogue. No parity violation is detected at any significance.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image pipeline for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract 1-year light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_{\rm E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models. V: A Correction to the Disequilibrium Abundance of CO$_2$ for Sonora Elf Owl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To aid the interpretation of observations of substellar atmospheres, Mukherjee et al. (2024) created the Sonora Elf Owl grid of model atmospheres, simulations that accounted for disequilibrium quench chemistry. However, Sonora Elf Owl did not accurately estimate CO$_2$ quenching because the models quenched the gas with respect to the full atmosphere equilibrium, but CO$_2$ should have instead been quenched with respect to the disequilibrium (i.e., quenched) abundance of CO. As a result, Sonora Elf Owl under-predicted the CO$_2$ abundance by several order of magnitude in some instances, an amount that JWST is sensitive to. Here, we release version two of the Sonora Elf Owl grid which has corrected CO$_2$ concentrations. Additionally, in version two we remove PH$_3$ as a spectral contributor since our spectra consistently contained too much PH$_3$ absorption. The new spectra can be found as an update to the original Zenodo postings.</description>

      <title>Pattern-recognition techniques to search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, dark-dressed primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, but current constraints suggest they cannot compose all of DM. This implies that additional DM components could coexist with PBHs, one of which could form "dark dresses" (DDs) around PBHs. DDs would cause PBH binaries to experience dynamical friction (DF), which would accelerate their inspirals with respect to those in vacuum. Ignoring DF effects in matched-filtering searches could lead to significant sensitivity loss, especially in systems with asymmetric mass-ratios of q ~ 10^{-3}. We thus show that a method designed to find time-frequency power-law tracks from inspiraling PBHs in vacuum could actually handle the presence of DDs with minimal modifications. This method, the generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), maps points in the detector's time-frequency plane to lines in the source parameter space. We show that this pattern-recognition technique can recover simulated DD signals in Gaussian noise, marking an important step forward in developing DM-aware methods beyond matched filtering.</description>
