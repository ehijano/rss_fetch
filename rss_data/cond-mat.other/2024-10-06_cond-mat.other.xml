      <title>Exchange striction induced thermal Hall effect in van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has emerged as an ideal probe for investigating topological phenomena of charge-neutral excitation. Notably, it reveals crucial aspects of spin-lattice couplings that have been difficult to access for decades. However, the exchange striction mechanism from a lattice-induced change in exchange interaction has often been ignored in thermal Hall experiments. MnPS3 can offer a platform to study exchange striction on the thermal Hall effect due to its significant spin-lattice coupling and field-induced non-collinear spin configuration. Our thermal transport data show distinct temperature and field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{xx}$) and thermal Hall effect ($\kappa_{xy}$). By using detailed theoretical calculation, we found that the inclusion of the exchange striction is essential for a better description of both $\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xy}$. Our result demonstrates the importance of the exchange striction mechanism for a complete understanding of the magnon-phonon-driven thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously formed phonon frequency combs in van der Waals solid CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge,Si)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical phonon engineering through nonlinear effects has been utilized in ultrafast control of material properties. However, nonlinear optical phonons typically exhibit rapid decay due to strong mode-mode couplings, limiting their effectiveness in temperature or frequency sensitive applications. In this study, we report the observation of long-lived nonlinear optical phonons through the spontaneous formation of phonon frequency combs in the van der Waals material CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge, Si) using high-resolution Raman scattering. Unlike conventional optical phonons, the highest $A_g$ mode in CrGeTe$_3$ splits into equidistant, sharp peaks forming a frequency comb that persists for hundreds of oscillations and survives up to 100K before decaying. These modes correspond to localized oscillations of Ge$_2$Te$_6$ clusters, isolated from Cr hexagons, behaving as independent quantum oscillators. Introducing a cubic nonlinear term to the harmonic oscillator model, we simulate the phonon time evolution and successfully replicate the observed comb structure. Similar frequency comb behavior is observed in CrSiTe$_3$, demonstrating the generalizability of this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that Raman scattering effectively probes high-frequency nonlinear phonon modes, providing new insight into generating long-lived, tunable phonon frequency combs with applications in ultrafast material control and phonon-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Single excitation migration in molecular chain with an attached molecular structure: non-adiabatic polaron model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the possibility of the stable migration of the single vibron excitation in the system consisting of biomolecule and the attached molecular structure. The model is based on the assumption of the vibron self-trapping and the formation of the non-adiabatic polaron quasiparticle. We have shown that, contrary to the prediction of the non-polaron model, the excitation appears on a large intramolecular distance from its origin with a high probability.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetry in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite acute interest in the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems, there is a lack of consensus in the mathematical formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the community. Different methodologies are used in the literature to study non-Hermitian dynamics. This ranges from consistent frameworks like biorthogonal quantum mechanics and metric approach characterized by modified inner products, to normalization by time-dependent norms inspired by open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically explore the similarities and differences among these various methods. Utilizing illustrative models with exact solutions, we demonstrate that these methods produce not only quantitatively different results but also distinct physical interpretations. For dissipative systems where non-Hermiticity arises as an approximation, we find that the normalization method in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime closely aligns with the full master equation solutions. In contrast, for quantum systems where non-Hermiticity can be engineered exactly, incorporating metric dynamics is crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, necessitating the generalization of unitary symmetry to non-Hermitian systems. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, potentially leveraging generalized symmetries for novel physical phenomena.</description>
