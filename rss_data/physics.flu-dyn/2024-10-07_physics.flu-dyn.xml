      <title>Thermovelocimetric Characterization of Liquid Metal Convection in a Rotating Slender Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating turbulent convection occurs ubiquitously in natural convective systems encompassing planetary cores, oceans, and atmospheres, as well as in many industrial applications. While the global heat and mass transfer of water-like rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection is well-documented, the characteristics of rotating convection in liquid metals remain less well understood. In this study, we characterize rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in liquid gallium (Prandtl number $Pr \approx 0.027$) within a slender cylinder (diameter-to-height aspect ratio $\Gamma = D/H = 1/2$) using novel thermovelocimetric diagnostic techniques that integrate simultaneous multi-point thermometry and ultrasonic Doppler velocity measurements. This approach experimentally reveals the formation of a stable azimuthal wavenumber $m = 2$ global-scale vortical structure at low supercriticality. We propose that enhanced wall modes facilitated by the slender cylinder geometry interact with the bulk flow to create these large-scale axialized vortices. Our findings extend results from the previous $Pr \sim 1$ studies across various cylindrical aspect ratios. In particular, we find evidence of a different scaling for wall mode precession frequency that possibly exists in liquid metal, offering new insights into the coupling effects in low-$Pr$ rotating convective turbulence.</description>

      <title>Swimmer-Types of Optimum Surface-Driven Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal microswimmer with a given geometry has a surface velocity profile that minimizes energy dissipation for a given swimming speed. An axisymmetric swimmer can be puller-, pusher-, or neutral-type depending on the sign of the stresslet strength. We numerically investigate the type of optimal surface-driven active microswimmers using a minimum dissipation theorem for optimum microswimmers. We examine the hydrodynamic resistance and stresslet strength with nonlinear dependence on various deformation modes. The results show that microswimmers with fore-and-aft symmetry exhibit neutral-type behavior, while asymmetrical geometries exhibit pusher-, puller-type or neutral-type behavior, depending on the dominant deformation mode and the nonlinear dependence of the stresslet for an optimum microswimmer on deformation mode and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Retraction of levitating drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This theoretical and numerical study focuses on the physical mechanisms driving the retraction of levitating Newtonian micrometric/millimetric/centimetric drops surrounded by air and under zero-gravity conditions. The drops present a pancake-like initial shape, gradually converging towards a spherical one under surface tension effects. Three drop retraction regimes are observed: capillary-inertial; mixed capillary-inertio-viscous; and capillary-viscous. In the first regime, the retraction is essentially driven by a competition between capillary pressure and inertial stresses, which induces a complex flow with equivalent shear, uniaxial and biaxial components. As the viscous stress becomes comparable to the capillary and the inertial stresses, the second regime emerges while shear-based deformations tend to vanish. Lastly, the third regime is dominated by a balance between capillary and viscous stresses, essentially exhibiting axial deformation. These physical features are underlined through multiphase three-dimensional numerical simulations and analysed in light of retraction dynamics, energy transfer and scaling laws. Our results are rationalised in a two-dimensional diagram linking the drop retraction time with the observed retraction regimes through a single dimensionless parameter combining capillary, inertial, viscous and geometrical effects, i.e., the retraction number.</description>

      <title>Lighthill's theory of sound generation in a non-isothermal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lighthill's theory of sound generation was developed to calculate acoustic radiation from a narrow region of turbulent flow embedded in an infinite homogeneous fluid. The theory is extended to include a simple model of non-isothermal medium that allows finding analytical solutions. The effects of one specific temperature gradient on the wave generation and propagation are studied. It is shown that that presence of the temperature gradient in the region of wave generation leads to monopole and dipole sources of acoustic emission, and that the efficiency of these two sources may be higher than Lighthill's quadrupoles. In addition, the wave propagation far from the source is different than in Lighthill's original work because of the presence of the acoustic cutoff frequency resulting from the temperature gradient.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Instabilities of Blood Flow in a Model Capillary Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of multiple blood flow configurations in a relatively simple microfluidic network under constant inlet conditions. We provide evidence of multistability and unsteady dynamics and find good agreement with a theoretical {one-dimensional advection} model for blood flow in microvascular networks{ that relies on the widely used laws for rheology and phase separation}. We discuss the ramifications for microfluidic experiments and measurements using blood and implications for in vivo microcirculation. Our findings suggest that further modeling in microvascular networks should discard the usual assumption of unique, steady-state flow solutions, with crucial consequences regarding gas, nutrient, and waste transport.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Droplet Coalescence: CNN-based Reconstruction of Flow Fields from Concentration Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-droplet coalescence and the mergers of liquid lenses are problems of great practical and theoretical interest in fluid dynamics and the statistical mechanics of multi-phase flows. During such mergers, there is an interesting and intricate interplay between the shapes of the interfaces, separating two phases, and the background flow field. In experiments, it is easier to visualize concentration fields than to obtain the flow field. We demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) encoder-decoder CNNs, 2D U-Nets, and three-dimensional (3D) U-Nets can be used to obtain flow fields from concentration fields here. To train these networks, we use concentration and flow fields, which we obtain from extensive direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of (a) the coalescence of two circular droplets in the two-component 2D Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) partial differential equations (PDEs), (b) liquid-lens mergers in the three-component 2D CHNS PDEs, and (c) spherical-droplet coalescence in the two-component 3D CHNS PDEs. We then show that, given test images of concentration fields, our trained models accurately predict the flow fields at both high and low Ohnesorge numbers $Oh$ (a dimensionless ratio of viscous stresses to the inertial and surface-tension forces). Using autoencoders and fully connected neural networks, we also investigate the mapping between the concentration and vorticity fields via low-dimensional latent variables for droplet mergers in the 2D CHNS system. We compare the accuracies of flow-field reconstruction based on the two approaches we employ. Finally, we use data from recent experiments on droplet coalescence to show how our method can be used to obtain the flow field from measurements of the concentration field.</description>

      <title>On the stability of an in-line formation of hydrodynamically interacting flapping plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of several plates in an inviscid and incompressible fluid is studied numerically using a vortex sheet model. Two to four plates are initially placed in-line, separated by a specified distance, and actuated in the vertical direction with a prescribed oscillatory heaving motion. The vertical motion induces the plates' horizontal acceleration due to their self-induced thrust and fluid drag forces. In certain parameter regimes, the plates adopt equilibrium "schooling modes," wherein they translate at a steady horizontal velocity while maintaining a constant separation distance between them. The separation distances are found to be quantized on the flapping wavelength. As either the number of plates increases or the oscillation amplitude decreases, the schooling modes destabilize via oscillations that propagate downstream from the leader and cause collisions between the plates, an instability that is similar to that observed in recent experiments on flapping wings in a water tank (Newbolt et al., 2024). A simple control mechanism is implemented, wherein each plate accelerates or decelerates according to its velocity relative to the plate directly ahead by modulating its own flapping amplitude. This mechanism is shown to successfully stabilize the schooling modes, with remarkable impact on the regularity of the vortex pattern in the wake. Several phenomena observed in the simulations are obtained by a reduced model based on linear thin-airfoil theory.</description>

      <title>Linear instability in thermally-stratified quasi-Keplerian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Keplerian flow, a special regime of Taylor-Couette co-rotating flow, is of great astrophysical interest for studying angular momentum transport in accretion disks. The well-known magnetorotational instability (MRI) successfully explains the flow instability and generation of turbulence in certain accretion disks, but fails to account for these phenomena in protoplanetary disks where magnetic effects are negligible. Given the intrinsic decrease of the temperature in these disks, we examine the effect of radial thermal stratification on 3-D global disturbances in linearised quasi-Keplerian flows under radial gravitational acceleration mimicking stellar gravity. Our results show a thermohydrodynamic linear instability for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes across a broad parameter space of the thermally-stratified quasi-Keplerian flow. Generally, decreasing Richardson or Prandtl numbers stabilises the flow, while a reduced radius ratio destabilises it. This work also provides a quantitative characterisation of the instability. At low Prandtl numbers $Pr$, we observe a scaling relation of the linear critical Taylor number $Ta_c\propto$$Pr^{-6/5}$. Extrapolating the observed scaling to high $Ta$ and low $Pr$ may suggest the relevance of the instability to accretion disks. Moreover, even slight thermal stratification, characterised by a low Richardson number, can trigger the flow instability with a small axial wavelength. These findings are qualitatively consistent with the results from a traditional local stability analysis based on short wave approximations. Our study refines the thermally-induced linearly-unstable transition route in protoplanetary disks to explain angular momentum transport in dead zones where MRI is ineffective.</description>

      <title>The interplay between topography and contact line pinning mechanisms on flat and superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wettability of a surface depends on both surface chemistry and topography. To move a three-phase contact line, a de-pinning force needs to be applied, which is of practical importance in various applications. However, a unified understanding and description of the de-pinning force on both flat and superhydrophobic surfaces is still lacking. This study aims to bridge the existing gap in our understanding of the three-phase contact line pinning on flat and microstructured superhydrophobic surfaces. The findings indicate that a general model, based on two different pinning mechanisms, can describe the pinning force on both flat and microstructured surfaces. We compare the general model against experimental data from literature, as well as our experiments on flat and microstructured surfaces coated with a liquid-like layer of grafted polymer chains. While this theoretical framework can be useful for designing micro-engineered surfaces on which the contact line behaviour is important, it also provides a potential experimental strategy to distinguish the contribution of defects from that of molecular re-orientation to contact line pinning on a given solid material.</description>

      <title>Sail dynamics during tacking maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of sail membranes during a tacking maneuver, when the sail angle of attack is reversed in order to sail upwind. In successful tacking the sail flips to the mirror-image shape, while in unsuccessful tacking the sail remains stuck in a metastable state close to the initial shape. We investigate whether the sail flips, and if so, how long it takes and the subsequent dynamics, over a parameter space that describes the sail membrane properties and the kinematics of tacking. We find that the "steady" parameters -- stretching rigidity, pretension, and final angle of attack -- mostly determine whether a membrane flips or not. Flipping is more likely with larger values of the stretching rigidity, pretension, and final angle of attack. The dynamical parameters -- membrane mass density, concavity of angle-of-attack transition kinematics, and time-length of the tacking maneuver -- mainly affect how long flipping takes. With large membrane mass the membrane can maintain the momentum from the tacking motion long enough to reach the flipped state, but it may also take longer to converge to a steady shape. Concave-down angle-of-attack profiles and small tack times are generally associated with shorter flip times but a few exceptions exist, because these kinematics can also give a larger acceleration to the fluid-sail system that persists for longer times. We also investigate slack sails and find that they are more difficult to flip.</description>

      <title>Airfoil Tonal Noise Reduction by Roughness Elements. Part II -- Direct Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a combined experimental and numerical effort we investigate airfoil tonal noise generation and reduction. The means of noise control are streak generators in form of cylindrical roughness elements. These elements are placed periodically along the span of airfoil at the mid chord streamwise position. Experiments are performed for a wide range of Reynolds number and angle of attack in a companion work (Alva et al. 2024). In the present work we concentrate on numerical investigations for a further investigation of selected cases. We have performed wall-resolved large-eddy simulations for a NACA 0012 airfoil at zero angle of attack and Mach 0.3. Two Reynolds numbers (80,000 and 100,000) have been investigated, showing acoustic results consistent with experiments at the same Reynolds but lower Mach numbers. Roughness elements attenuate tones in the acoustic field and, for the higher Reynolds number, suppress them. Through Fourier decomposition and spectral POD analysis of streamwise velocity data, dominating structures have been identified. Further, the coupling between structures generated by surface roughness and instability modes (Kelvin-Helmholtz) of shear layer has been identified through stability analysis, suggesting stabilisation mechanisms by which the sound generation by the airfoil is reduced by the roughness elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laminar separation bubbles around airfoils lead to the growth of instability waves, which enhances to acoustic scattering at the trailing-edge, forming a feedback loop that produces to tonal noise. To reduce the trailing-edge tonal noise, an array of roughness elements was used over a NACA0012 airfoil, at low angles of attack and moderate Reynolds number. Aeroacoustics and flow visualization experiments were performed for four configurations: a baseline smooth airfoil, two configurations with roughness elements on either airfoil surface (pressure side or suction side), and a fourth configuration with roughness elements at both airfoil surfaces. The roughness elements are made up of a row of spanwise periodically spaced cylinders, which were placed close to the mid-chord position. %in order to induce streaks, by the lift-up effect, that render the bubble three-dimensional, decreasing separation and stabilizing the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the separated shear layer, which is related to tonal noise. It is expected the proposed array of roughness elements stabilizes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism that is present on the separated shear layer through the induction of streak structures. The separation bubble is assessed using oil flow visualizations, and the cases with roughness elements show the generation of streaks downstream of the array cylinders, disrupting the separation bubble. Acoustic measurements results show a decrease, and in some cases the total suppression, of the tonal noise at Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.6$\times$10$^5$ to 2.5$\times$10$^5$, and angles of attack ranging from 0 to 4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the high Mach number asymptote for bubble collapse in a compressible Euler fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation is a process where bubbles form and collapse within a fluid with dynamic, spatially varying pressure. This phenomenon can concentrate energy density by 12 orders of magnitude, creating light-emitting plasma or damaging nearby surfaces. A key question in cavitation theory and experiments is: what are the upper limits of energy density achievable through this spontaneous multiscale process? Among the many physical processes at play, we focus on fluid compressibility, modeled using the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state for a homentropic Euler fluid. We examine spherical cavities corresponding to experimentally realizable sonoluminescing bubbles, whose radius changes by a factor of over 100. These bubbles reach velocities exceeding the speed of sound of the surrounding fluid. However, all-Mach hydrodynamic solvers, such as those implemented using the Basilisk software, can exhibit unphysical behavior even at early times when motion is nearly incompressible. To accurately capture high Mach number motion and resolve dynamics in the sonoluminescence regime, we introduced a uniform bubble approximation for the ideal gas inside the bubble. This leading-order approximation clarifies the significant effects of compressibility. Our results reproduce the equation-of-state-dependent asymptotic power-law region predicted by analytic calculations. This confirms our method's ability to capture high Mach number motion and suggests that the asymptotic regime could be experimentally observed. Convergence of this method is demonstrated for bubbles in both water and liquid lithium, showing that compressibility slows collapse. Additionally, an outgoing shock wave in the compressible fluid is resolved.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Turbulence Models to Represent Cloud-Edge Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering turbulence is crucial to understanding clouds. However, covering all scales involved in the turbulent mixing of clouds with their environment is computationally challenging, urging the development of simpler models to represent some of the processes involved. By using full direct numerical simulations as a reference, this study compares several statistical approaches for representing small-scale turbulent mixing. All models use a comparable Lagrangian representation of cloud microphysics, and simulate the same cases of cloud-edge mixing, covering different ambient humidities and turbulence intensities. It is demonstrated that all statistical models represent the evolution of thermodynamics successfully, but not all models capture the changes in cloud microphysics (cloud droplet number concentration, droplet mean radius, and spectral width). Implications of these results for using the presented models as subgrid-scale schemes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Numerical Solution for Nonlinear 4D Variational Data Assimilation (4D-Var) via ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) has emerged as an important methodology, widely used in numerical weather prediction, oceanographic modeling, and climate forecasting. Classical unconstrained gradient-based algorithms often struggle with local minima, making their numerical performance highly sensitive to the initial guess. In this study, we exploit the separable structure of the 4D-Var problem to propose a practical variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), referred to as the linearized multi-block ADMM with regularization. Unlike classical first-order optimization methods that primarily focus on initial conditions, our approach derives the Euler-Lagrange equation for the entire dynamical system, enabling more comprehensive and effective utilization of observational data. When the initial condition is poorly chosen, the arg min operation steers the iteration towards the observational data, thereby reducing sensitivity to the initial guess. The quadratic subproblems further simplify the solution process, while the parallel structure enhances computational efficiency, especially when utilizing modern hardware. To validate our approach, we demonstrate its superior performance using the Lorenz system, even in the presence of noisy observational data. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the linearized multi-block ADMM with regularization in solving the 4D-Var problems for the viscous Burgers' equation, across various numerical schemes, including finite difference, finite element, and spectral methods. Finally, we illustrate the recovery of dynamics under noisy observational data in a 2D turbulence scenario, particularly focusing on vorticity concentration, highlighting the robustness of our algorithm in handling complex physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion in pre-turbulent confined active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dispersion of solutes in active nematic fluids confined in narrow channels based on simulations of nematohydrodynamics. The study focuses on two pre-turbulent regimes: oscillatory flow, with net mass flux, and dancing flow, without net flux. Our findings reveal that the longitudinal dispersion of solutes, in both regimes, is determined by the second moments of the longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity field and proportional to the activity, suggesting a common mechanism for dispersion in these distinct flows. Finally, we found that the dispersion coefficient may increase up to one order of magnitude with respect to molecular diffusion in the dancing flow regime and that it is also enhanced in oscillatory flows, with potential for applications in natural biological environments and engineered devices.</description>

      <title>Provably Positivity-Preserving Constrained Transport (PPCT) Second-Order Scheme for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order positivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme ensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and pressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao, M. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the MHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic subsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these structure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a finite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem via Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that retains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and pressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the magnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that conserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system is efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since the CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and internal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the finite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus is on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several challenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with high Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high resolution.</description>

      <title>Vortex Stretching of Non-premixed, Diluted Hydrogen/Oxygen Flamelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-dimensional flamelet model considering vortex stretching with unitary Lewis number is used to simulate diluted hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flames. Non-reacting nitrogen is used as the diluent gas in the fuel stream. Unitary Lewis number provides a common thermal and mass diffusivity from which to create scalar dissipation rate. Both stable and unstable branches of flammability curves (S-curves) are calculated with three vorticity levels and plotted against multiple input and output parameters. The description of the three-dimensional flamelet structure, allowing vorticity and variable density to produce a centrifugal effect, is seen to be necessary for an accurate determination of the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ production rate when ambient inflow strain rate $(S^*)$ and vorticity $(\omega)$ are chosen as the key parameters. Maximum temperature and integrated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ production rate each nearly collapse to a single curve when plotted versus maximum scalar dissipation rate $(\chi_{max})$ but do not collapse when plotted versus the local maximum strain rate $(S^*_{local})$ or $S^*$. Additionally, $S^*_{local}$ and scalar dissipation rate $(\chi)$ depend strongly on vorticity and ambient inflow strain rate. It is argued that the controlling inputs for a flamelet embedded in a turbulent eddy are the ambient vorticity and strain rate which are thus the natural choice of parameterizing variables. These ambient quantities can be readily linked to the averaged or filtered turbulent flow by leveraging cascade theory, as opposed to local strain rate or scalar dissipation rate within the flame zone, which do not have a widely accepted, first-principles scaling connection to the turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Element Enrichment Wall-Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an enrichment wall-model within the spectral element method (SEM) framework for large-eddy simulations of wall-bounded flows. The method augments the polynomial solution in the wall-adjacent elements with an analytical law-of-the-wall enrichment function representing the mean velocity near the wall. In the solution representation, this enrichment function captures the large gradients in the boundary layer, which allows the polynomial modes to represent the turbulent fluctuations. The enriched solution is able to resolve the shear stress at the wall without any modification to the no-slip wall boundary conditions. The performance of the SEM enrichment wall-modeling approach is assessed in turbulent channel flow LES for a range of Reynolds numbers. The results show that the proposed method improves solution accuracy on under-resolved near-wall grids as compared to the traditional shear stress wall-models.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>

      <title>Random large eddy simulation for 3-dimensional incompressible viscous flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Role of Duty Cycle in Burst-Modulated Synthetic Jet Flow Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study on flow reattachment over a stalled airfoil using an array of microblowers operating as synthetic jet actuators (SJAs). The effects of burst duty cycle (DC) and blowing ratio, alongside power requirements, are examined in relation to SJA-induced vortical structures and aerodynamic performance. Results show that increasing the DC or blowing ratio can achieve the threshold momentum coefficient required for flow reattachment. While both DC and blowing ratios impact control efficacy, achieving a specific momentum coefficient generally corresponds to a consistent lift coefficient, regardless of the individual parameter values. Substantial lift improvements are observed at DCs as low as 5%, indicating that brief, high-momentum perturbations to the flow are sufficient for reattachment, resulting in significant power savings. However, analysis of the flow dynamics reveals that low-DC control strategies result in unsteady, phase-dependent flow behavior due to the induced vortices' rapid dissipation and inconsistent evolution. Higher DCs produce stronger, more persistent vortices that remain closer to the airfoil surface, leading to a more stable and effective control strategy. The study also highlights the challenge of achieving full spanwise control across the finite-span array, as even high-power strategies could not achieve a control length greater than 40% of the array's span. Additionally, a strong correlation between the lift coefficient and the suction peak pressure coefficient is observed, indicating that single-point measurements suffice for rapid assessment of control effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-range order in two dimensions where an order parameter is advected by laminar flows such as rotational, shear, and elongational flows. Under these flows, we analyze an ordered state of the $O(N)$ scalar model in the large-$N$ limit. We show that the stability of the ordered state depends on the flow pattern; shear and elongational flows stabilize the long-range order but rotational flow does not. We discuss the physical mechanism underlying our results by connecting static correlations of fluctuations and their dynamics based on the interaction representation used in quantum mechanics. We find that advective transport induces superdiffusion under shear and elongational flows, thereby stabilizing the long-range order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O (dye) floating on the water surface shows spontaneous motion and deformation generated by the surface tension gradient around the droplet. We focused on the intermittent motion with a pronounced deformation into a crescent shape observed at specific concentrations of camphor and oil red O. We quantitatively analyzed the time changes in the droplet deformation and investigated the role of the oil red O by measuring the time-dependent paraffin/water interfacial tension with the pendant drop method. The observed effect can be explained by the active role of the oil red O molecules at the paraffin/water interface. The interfacial tension decreases gradually after the interface formation, allowing for the dynamic deformation of the droplet. The combination of the decrease in interfacial tension and the reduction in driving force related to camphor outflow generates intermittent motion with dynamic deformation into a crescent shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. Though these algorithms are end-to-end, they require relatively low-depth quantum circuits and protect quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show} are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>
