      <title>Dynamical robustness of network of oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most complex systems are nonlinear, relying on emergent behavior from interacting subsystems, often characterized by oscillatory dynamics. Collective oscillatory behavior is essential for the proper functioning of many real world systems. Complex networks have proven efficient in elucidating the topological structures of both natural and artificial systems and describing diverse processes occurring within them. Recent advancements have significantly enhanced our understanding of emergent dynamics in complex networks. Among various processes, a substantial body of work explores the dynamical robustness of complex networks, their ability to withstand degradation in network constituents while maintaining collective oscillatory dynamics. Many physical and biological systems experience a decline in dynamic activities due to natural or environmental factors. The impact of such damages on network performance can be significant, and the system's robustness indicates its capability to maintain functionality despite dynamic changes, often termed aging. This review provides a comprehensive overview of notable research examining how networks sustain global oscillation despite increasing inactive dynamical units. We present contemporary research dedicated to the theoretical understanding and enhancement mechanisms of dynamical robustness in complex networks. Our focus includes various network structures and coupling functions, elucidating the persistence of networked systems. We cover system characteristics from heterogeneity in network connectivity to heterogeneity in dynamical units. Finally, we discuss challenges in this field and open areas for future studies.</description>

      <title>Three Myths in Complexity Science and How to Resolve Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From bird flocking to neural dynamics, complex systems generate fascinating structures and correlations. Often, seemingly simple dynamics lead to intricate emergent properties. Despite their visceral appeal, defining complex systems lacks universal agreement. In this paper, I will debunk three prevalent myths in complex systems and propose resolutions. This work contributes by offering a contemporary interpretation of complex systems, presenting essential definitions that benefit complexity scientists.</description>

      <title>Interaction spaces: towards a universal mathematical theory of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first steps of interaction spaces theory, a universal mathematical theory of complex systems which is able to embed cellular automata, agent based models, master equation based models, stochastic or deterministic, continuous or discrete dynamical systems, networked dynamical models, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms in a single notion. Therefore, interaction spaces represent a common mathematical language that can be used to describe several complex systems modeling frameworks. This is the first step to start a mathematical theory of complex systems. Every notion is introduced both using an intuitive description by listing lots of examples, and using a modern mathematical language.</description>

      <title>A mathematical definition of complex adaptive system as interaction space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a mathematical notion of complex adaptive system by following the original intuition of G.K. Zipf about the principle of least effort, an intuitive idea which is nowadays informally widespread in complex systems modeling. We call generalized evolution principle this mathematical notion of interaction spaces theory. Formalizing and generalizing Mandelbrot's ideas, we also prove that a large class of these systems satisfy a power law. We finally illustrate the notion of complex adaptive system with theorems describing a Von Th\"unen-like model. The latter can be easily generalized to other complex systems and describes the appearance of emergent patterns. Every notion is introduced both using an intuitive description with lots of examples, and using a modern mathematical language.</description>

      <title>Solving the prisoner's dilemma trap in Hamilton's model of temporarily formed random groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the evolution of cooperation in the strong altruism scenario, where a cooperator does not benefit from her contribution to the public goods, is a challenging problem that requires positive assortment among cooperators (i.e., cooperators must tend to associate with other cooperators) or punishment of defectors. The need for these drastic measures stems from the analysis of a group selection model of temporarily formed random groups introduced by Hamilton nearly fifty years ago to describe the fate of altruistic behavior in a population. Challenging conventional wisdom, we show analytically here that strong altruism evolves in Hamilton's original model in the case of biparental sexual reproduction. Moreover, when the cost of cooperation is small and the amplified contribution shared by group members is large, cooperation is the only stable strategy in equilibrium. Thus, our results provide a solution to the `problem of origination' of strong altruism, i.e. how cooperation can take off from an initial low frequency of cooperators. We discuss a possible reassessment of cooperation in cases of viral co-infection, as cooperation may even be favored in situations where the prisoner's dilemma applies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of economic and social disparities through competitive gift-giving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several tiers of social organization with varying economic and social disparities have been observed. However, a quantitative characterization of the types and the causal mechanisms for the transitions have hardly been explained. While anthropologists have emphasized that gift exchange, rather than market exchange, prevails in traditional societies and shapes social relations, few mathematical studies have explored its consequences for social organizations. In this study, we present a simple model of competitive gift-giving that describes how gifts bring goods to the recipient and honor to the donor, and simulate social change. Numerical simulations and an analysis of the corresponding mean-field theory demonstrate the transitions between the following four phases with different distribution shapes of wealth and social reputation: the band, without economic or social disparities; the tribe, with economic but without social disparities; the chiefdom, with both; and the kingdom, with economic disparity and weak social disparity except for an outlier, namely, the ``monarch''. The emergence of strong disparities is characterized by power law distributions and is attributed to the ``rich get richer'' process. In contrast, the absence of such a process leads to exponential distributions due to random fluctuations. The phases depend on the parameters characterizing the frequency and scale of gift interactions. Our findings provide quantitative criteria for classifying social organizations based on economic and social disparities, consistent with anthropological theory and empirical observations. Thus, we propose empirically measurable explanatory variables and characteristics for the evolution of social organizations. The constructive model, guided by social scientific theory, can provide the basic mechanistic explanation of social evolution and integrate theories of the social sciences.</description>
