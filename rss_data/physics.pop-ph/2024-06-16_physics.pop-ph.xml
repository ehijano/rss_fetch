      <title>Is it Truly Necessary for Bicycle Power Meters to Rapidly Sample Angular Velocity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bicycle Power Meters have become ubiquitous in professional and amateur cycling. These devices claim high levels of accuracy, and this accuracy is indeed essential if they are to serve their purpose as reliable training aids and indicators of improvements in fitness. Power is generally obtained via the independent estimation of torque and angular velocity. Designs vary in the way in which they estimate angular velocity. Some power meters estimate angular velocity many times a second, whereas other power meters compute an average value for each pedal stroke. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether it is necessary to rapidly sample angular velocity in order to obtain accurate power values under conditions of dynamic equilibrium. Countering previous research on the topic, this paper finds that average angular velocity alone is usually sufficient for the purposes of computing power, although there may be certain exceptional circumstances where consideration of harmonics may appreciably improve fidelity.</description>

      <title>Lichen-Mediated Self-Growing Construction Materials for Habitat Outfitting on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As its next step in space exploration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed plans to establish a permanent human presence on Mars. Habitat outfitting, i.e., the technology to provide the crew with the necessary equipment to perform mission tasks as well as a comfortable, safe, and livable habitable volume, has not been fully explored yet. This study proposes that, rather than shipping prefabricated outfitting elements to Mars, habitat outfitting can be realized by in-situ construction using cyanobacteria and fungi as building agents. A synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, can be created to produce abundant biominerals (CaCO3) and biopolymers, which will glue Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into various structures, such as floors, walls, partitions, and furniture.</description>
