      <title>On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

      <title>Local-global compatibility and the exceptional zero conjecture for GL(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the exceptional zero conjecture of Greenberg--Benois for $p$-ordinary regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A})$ which are Steinberg at $p$. In particular, we obtain the first cases of this conjecture for non-essentially-self-dual RACARs of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A})$.
  Our proof has two main parts. In Part 1, we use $p$-arithmetic cohomology to prove an exceptional zero formula using Gehrmann's automorphic $\mathcal{L}$-invariant. In Part 2 we prove the equality of automorphic and Fontaine--Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants. As one of the key ingredients for this, we establish local-global compatibility at $\ell = p$ for Galois representations attached to $p$-ordinary torsion classes for $\mathrm{GL}_n$, confirming a conjecture of Hansen in this setting. We prove this for all $n$ following the strategy in the "10-author paper," and use the $n=3$ case to deduce the desired equality of $\mathcal{L}$-invariants.</description>

      <title>Supercharacters of finite abelian groups and applications to spectra of $U$-unitary Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define super-Cayley graphs over a finite abelian group $G$. Using the theory of supercharacters on $G$, we explain how their spectra can be realized as a super-Fourier transform of a superclass characteristic function. Consequently, we show that a super-Cayley graph is determined by its spectrum once an indexing on the underlying group $G$ is fixed. This generalizes a theorem by Sander-Sander, which investigates the case where $G$ is a cyclic group. We then use our theory to define and study the concept of a $U$-unitary Cayley graph over a finite commutative ring $R$, where $U$ is a subgroup of the unit group of $R$. Furthermore, when the underlying ring is a Frobenius ring, we show that there is a natural supercharacter theory associated with $U$. By applying the general theory of super-Cayley graphs developed in the first part, we explore various spectral properties of these $U$-unitary Cayley graphs, including their rationality and connections to various arithmetical sums.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let Fq be the finite field with q elements, and K an algebraic function field over with Fq as its field of constants. Let S be a finite nonempty set of prime divisors over K, and OS be the ring of integers of K attached to S. Let w greater than 1 be an integer. In this work we shall count w coprime S integers and S integral ideals, and our proofs are a combination of analytic methods and the Riemann Roch theorem and the Weil theorem for function fields in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>A class number problem for imaginary cyclic number fields of 2-power degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, M. K. Ram proved that the class number of an imaginary cyclic quartic number field is never equal to a prime $p\equiv 3\pmod 4$. Here we greatly generalize this result to the case of the non-quadratic imaginary cyclic number fields of $2$-power degrees and not necessarily prime class numbers.</description>

      <title>A Canonical Bijection Between Finite-Decimal Real Numbers and Natural Numbers with Constant-Time Enumeration Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit bijection between finite-decimal real numbers and natural numbers ($\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$) using a systematic 4-tuple parametrization with closed-form mathematical formulas for enumeration. Our enumeration system provides complete indexing of all real numbers with terminating decimal representations through the parametrization $(\text{sign}, N_1, N_2, N_3)$. Both forward and inverse mappings execute in O(1) constant time, achieved through closed-form lexicographic positioning formulas that eliminate enumeration loops. The system uses exact decimal arithmetic throughout, ensuring perfect accuracy across all representable numbers. This bijective correspondence demonstrates that finite-decimal real numbers can be systematically enumerated and indexed with optimal constant-time computational efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study second-order modular differential equations whose solutions transform equivariantly under the modular group. In the reducible case, we construct all such solutions using an explicit ansatz involving Eisenstein series and the $J$-invariant, reducing the problem to an algebraic system. We show that the roots of this system are captured by orthogonal polynomials satisfying a Fuchsian differential equation. Their recurrence, norms, and weight function are derived, completing the classification of equivariant solutions in this setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi$ and $\pi'$ be cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{GL}(n')$ with unitary central characters. We establish a new zero-free region for all $\mathrm{GL}(1)$-twists of the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\pi\times\pi')$, generalizing Tatuzawa's refinement of Siegel's work on Dirichlet $L$-functions. A crucial component of our proof is a new standard zero-free region for any twist of $L(s,\pi\times\widetilde{\pi})$ by an idele class character $\chi$ apart from a possible single exceptional zero (necessarily real and simple) that can occur only when $\pi\otimes\chi^2=\pi$. This extends earlier work of Humphries and Thorner.</description>

      <title>The Alternative Hypothesis for Zeros of the Riemann Zeta-Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, the first-named author introduced a formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis that assumes that consecutive zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are spaced at multiples of half of the average spacing, but does not assume that the zeros are simple. In this paper, we assume the Riemann Hypothesis and a similar formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis, and for each integer $k$ we obtain constraints on the density of pairs of zeros whose normalized differences are at $k/2$ times the average spacing. These constraints, in turn, restrict the density of (possible) multiple zeros. We also formulate a stronger version of the Alternative Hypothesis and show that it implies the Essential Simplicity Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Lenstra flag universality for random matrix products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $n \times n$ random integer matrices $M_1,\ldots,M_k$, the cokernels of the partial products $\mathrm{cok}(M_1 \cdots M_i), 1 \leq i \leq k$ naturally define a random flag of abelian $p$-groups. We prove that as $n \to \infty$, this flag converges universally, for any nondegenerate entry distribution, to the Cohen-Lenstra type measure which weights each flag inversely proportional to the size of its automorphism group. As a corollary, we prove universality of certain formulas for the limiting conditional distribution of $\mathrm{cok}(M_1M_2)$ given $\mathrm{cok}(M_1),\mathrm{cok}(M_2)$ in terms of Hall-Littlewood structure constants, which were previously obtained only for Haar matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Our proofs combine the general technology of Sawin-Wood, matrix product moment computations following those of Nguyen-Van Peski, and the computation done previously for Haar $p$-adic matrices by Huang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth irreducible quasi-projective algebraic variety over a number field $K$. Suppose $X$ is equipped with a $p$-adic \'{e}tale local system compatible with an admissible graded-polarized variation of mixed Hodge structures on the complex analytification of $X_{\mathbb{C}}$. We prove that the $S$-integral points in $X$ are covered by subpolynomially many geometrically irreducible $K$-subvarieties, each lying in a fiber of the mixed period mapping arising from the variation of mixed Hodge structures. This is based on recent works by Brunebarbe-Maculan and Ellenberg-Lawrence-Venkatesh. As an application, we prove that there are subpolynomially many $S$-integral Laurent polynomials with fixed reflexive Newton polyhedron $\Delta$ and fixed non-zero principal $\Delta$-determinant. Our results answer a question asked by Ellenberg-Lawrence-Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Prosaic Abelian Varieties Bad at One Prime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that an abelian variety $A_{/{\mathbb Q}}$ of dimension $g$ is prosaic if it is semistable, with good reduction at 2 and its points of order $2$ generate a $2$-extension of ${\mathbb Q}$. We show that if $B$ is prosaic and simple, then there is an isogenous abelian variety $A$ for which End $A$ is the ring of integers $\mathfrak{o}$ in a number field $L$. The field $L$ is a totally real or CM field and all primes of $\mathfrak{o}$ over $2$ have residue degree $1$.
  For $p \equiv 1$ (mod 8), let $M_u$ be the maximal 2-primary unramified abelian extension of $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ and let $h_2 = [M_u:K]$. We construct an indecomposable group scheme $\Xi_p$ over ${\mathbb Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$ of exponent 2 with field of points $M_u$.
  Assume that $A$ is prosaic, with bad reduction at only one prime $p$. Then $p \equiv 1$ (mod 8) and $A$ is totally toroidal at $p$. We prove that if End $A={\mathbb Z}$, then there is a ${\mathbb Q}$-isogenous abelian variety $B$ such that $B[2]$ is a subquotient of $\Xi_p$. We thereby show that $2g+2 \le h_2$ and $p$ has the form $a^2+16b^2$, with $a+4b \equiv \pm 1$ (mod 8). Moreover, if $2g + 4 \le h_2$, then $p$ has the form $a^2+64b^2$, with $a \equiv \pm 1$ (mod 8).</description>

      <title>Smooth polynomials with several prescribed coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ be the polynomial ring over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $q$ elements. A polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ is called $m$-smooth (or $m$-friable) if all its irreducible factors are of degree at most $m$. In this paper, we investigate the distribution of $m$-smooth (or $m$-friable) polynomials with prescribed coefficients. Our technique is based on character sum estimates on smooth (friable) polynomials, Bourgains's argument (2015) applied for polynomials by Ha (2016) and on double character sums on smooth (friable) polynomials.</description>

      <title>Injectivity of the genus 1 Kudla-Millson lift on locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be an even indefinite lattice. We show that if $L$ splits off a hyperbolic plane and a scaled hyperbolic plane, then the Kudla-Millson lift of genus $1$ associated to $L$ is injective. Our result includes as special cases all previously known injectivity results on the whole space of elliptic cusp forms available in the literature. In particular, we also consider the Funke-Millson twist of the lift. Further, we provide geometric applications on locally symmetric spaces of orthogonal type.</description>

      <title>On the Zeros of the Miller Basis of Cusp Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the zeros of cusp forms in the Miller basis whose vanishing order at infinity is a fixed number $m$. We show that for sufficiently large weights, the finite zeros of such forms in the fundamental domain, all lie on the circular part of the boundary of the fundamental domain. We further show and quantify an effective bound for the weight, which is linear in terms of $m$.</description>

      <title>Wildly ramified unitary local models for special parahorics. The odd dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct local models for wildly ramified unitary similitude groups of odd dimension $n\geq 3$ with special parahoric level structure and signature $(n-1,1)$. We first give a lattice-theoretic description for parahoric subgroups using Bruhat-Tits theory in residue characteristic two, and apply them to define local models following the lead of Rapoport-Zink and Pappas-Rapoport. In our case, there are two conjugacy classes of special parahoric subgroups. We show that the local models are smooth for the one class and normal, Cohen-Macaulay for the other class. We also prove that they represent the v-sheaf local models of Scholze-Weinstein. Under some additional assumptions, we obtain an explicit moduli interpretation of the local models.</description>

      <title>The Hasse norm principle for some extensions of degree having square-free prime factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the structure of the obstruction group of the Hasse norm principle for a finite separable extension $K/k$ of a global field of degree $d$, where $d$ has a square-free prime factor $p$ and a $p$-Sylow subgroup of the Galois group $G$ of the Galois closure of $K/k$ is normal in $G$. Specifically, we give a partial classification of the validity of the Hasse norm principle for $K/k$ in the case where (1) $[K:k]=p\ell$ where $p$ and $\ell$ are two distinct prime numbers; or (2) $[K:k]=4p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. The result (1) gives infinitely many new existences of finite extensions of arbitrary number fields for which the Hasse norm principle fail. Furthermore, we prove that there exist infinitely many separable extensions of square-free degree for which the exponents of the obstruction groups to the Hasse norm principle are not prime powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new conditions under which a sequence of real numbers has metric Poissonian pair correlation. These conditions strengthen results of Aistleitner, El-Baz and Munsch (2021) and resolve one of their open problems under a mild growth assumption. As applications, we show that quantitatively convex and polynomial sequences have metric Poissonian pair correlation.</description>

      <title>Certain Siegel Cusp Forms with Level are Determined by their Fundamental Fourier Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that vector-valued Siegel cusp forms for $\Gamma_0^n(N)$ with certain nebentypus are determined by their fundamental Fourier coefficients with discriminants coprime to the level $N$, assuming $N$ is odd and square-free. In the case of genus $3$, we strengthen this to Fourier coefficients corresponding to maximal orders in quaternion algebras. We also prove that Jacobi forms of fundamental index with discriminant coprime to the odd level $N$ are determined by their primitive theta components.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Ax-Schanuel property of the derivatives of mixed period mappings. We also prove the jet space reformulation of this result. The proofs use the Ax-Schanuel result for principal bundles with flat connections obtained by Bl\'{a}zquez-Sanz, Casale, Freitag, and Nagloo.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that for any finite coloring of N there are lambda,rho in N such that infinitely many pairs (x,y),(u,v) in N^2 satisfy the sets {lambda x, lambda y, x y, lambda(x+y)} and {u+rho, v+rho, u v+rho, u+v} being monochromatic. Using related arguments we also give two different proofs of a special case of the Milliken--Taylor theorem.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Steklov problem on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>
