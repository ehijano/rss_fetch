      <title>Fully Kinetic Simulations of Proton-Beam-Driven Instabilities from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expanding solar wind plasma ubiquitously exhibits anisotropic non-thermal particle velocity distributions. Typically, proton Velocity Distribution Functions (VDFs) show the presence of a core and a field-aligned beam. Novel observations made by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the innermost heliosphere have revealed new complex features in the proton VDFs, namely anisotropic beams that sometimes experience perpendicular diffusion. This phenomenon gives rise to VDFs that resemble a "hammerhead". In this study, we use a 2.5D fully kinetic simulation to investigate the stability of proton VDFs with anisotropic beams observed by PSP. Our setup consists of a core and an anisotropic beam populations that drift with respect to each other. This configuration triggers a proton-beam instability from which nearly parallel fast magnetosonic modes develop. Our results demonstrate that before this instability reaches saturation, the waves resonantly interact with the beam protons, causing significant perpendicular heating at the expense of the parallel temperature. Furthermore, the proton perpendicular heating induces a hammerhead-like shape in the resulting VDF. Our results suggest that this mechanism probably contribute to producing the observed hammerhead distributions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Realistic Heating Profiles of Transition Region Hot Loops on the Sun: Evidence for Impulsive Heating and Non-equilibrium Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study examines the heating profile of hot solar transition region loops, particularly focusing on transient brightenings observed in IRIS 1400{\AA} slit-jaw images. The findings challenge the adequacy of simplistic, singular heating mechanisms, revealing that the heating is temporally impulsive and requires a spatially complex profile with multiple heating scales. A forward modeling code is utilized to generate synthetic IRIS emission spectra of these loops based on HYDRAD output, confirming that emitting ions are out of equilibrium. The modeling further indicates that density-dependent dielectronic recombination rates must be included to reproduce the observed line ratios. Collectively, this evidence substantiates that the loops are subject to impulsive heating and that the components of the transiently brightened plasma are driven far from thermal equilibrium. Heating events such as these are ubiquitous in the transition region and the analysis described above provides a robust observational diagnostic tool for characterizing the plasma.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>
