      <title>Kinetic control of ferroelectricity in ultrathin epitaxial Barium Titanate capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity is characterized by the presence of spontaneous and switchable macroscopic polarization. Scaling limits of ferroelectricity have been of both fundamental and technological importance, but the probes of ferroelectricity have often been indirect due to confounding factors such as leakage in the direct electrical measurements. Recent interest in low-voltage switching electronic devices squarely puts the focus on ultrathin limits of ferroelectricity in an electronic device form, specifically on the robustness of ferroelectric characteristics such as retention and endurance for practical applications. Here, we illustrate how manipulating the kinetic energy of the plasma plume during pulsed laser deposition can yield ultrathin ferroelectric capacitor heterostructures with high bulk and interface quality, significantly low leakage currents and a broad "growth window". These heterostructures venture into previously unexplored aspects of ferroelectric properties, showcasing ultralow switching voltages ($&lt;$0.3 V), long retention times ($&gt;$10$^{4}$s), and high endurance ($&gt;$10$^{11}$cycles) in 20 nm films of the prototypical perovskite ferroelectric, BaTiO$_{3}$. Our work demonstrates that materials engineering can push the envelope of performance for ferroelectric materials and devices at the ultrathin limit and opens a direct, reliable and scalable pathway to practical applications of ferroelectrics in ultralow voltage switches for logic and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Low Leakage Ferroelectric Heteroepitaxial Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N Films on GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite (Al,Sc)N ferroelectrics are attractive for microelectronics applications due to their chemical and epitaxial structural compatibility with wurtzite semiconductors such as GaN and (Al,Ga)N. However, the leakage current in epitaxial stacks reported to date should be reduced for reliable device operation. Following the tradition of other semiconductor heterostructures, crystalline structural quality, as measured by breadth of diffraction peaks and correlating with dislocation density, is commonly used as a proxy for leakage current, but we demonstrate here that the crystalline mosaicity that dominates the broadening of diffraction peaks in epitaxial Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N stacks does not dominate leakage current. We report here well-saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loops and orders of magnitude lower leakage current (0.07 A cm$^{-2}$) compared to values reported in literature (1 ~ 19 A cm$^{-2}$) for sputter-deposited epitaxial Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N/GaN of comparable crystalline quality to prior reports. Further, we show Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N on lattice-matched InGaN buffers with improved structural characteristics exhibits increased leakage characteristics. This demonstration and understanding can help to guide further efforts towards reliable wurtzite ferroelectric devices and prioritize approaches targeting further leakage current reduction.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Zn-Volatility for Compositional Tuning in PtZn Nanoalloy Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimetallic nanoalloys have gained extensive attention due to their tunable properties and wide range of catalytic applications. However, achieving good compositional control in nanoalloy catalysts remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that heat treatment can be used to tune the composition of Pt-Zn nanoalloy catalysts, leveraging the volatile nature of zinc to enhance their performance in propane dehydrogenation. Through identical location (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (IL-(S)TEM) using an in-situ EM gas cell, as well as other complementary techniques, we observed that the zinc content of the Pt-Zn nanoalloy particles decreased over time of the heat treatment under hydrogen. The rate of change depends on the original composition of the particles, as well as the heat treatment conditions such as temperature and flow rate. Our experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that Zn in the intermetallic phase might be more stable, providing an opportunity for precise tuning the nanoparticle compositions. This approach presents a viable strategy for developing better Pt-Zn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.</description>

      <title>High strength self-healable supercapacitor based on supramolecular polymer hydrogel with upper critical solubility temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report poly(N-acryloylglycinamide-co-vinyltriazole) p(NAGA-co-VTZ) supramolecular polymer hydrogel doped with activated polypyrrole nanotubes (acPPyNTs) as a high-strength self-healable material for supercapacitors. First, the p(NAGA-co-VTZ) hydrogel films were synthesized by photopolymerization of N-acryloylglycinamide and 1-vinyl-1,2,4-triazole without any cross-linkers. Scanning electron microscopy and mechanical tests showed that initial monomer concentration strongly affects both hydrogel microstructure and resulted mechanical properties. The hydrogels demonstrated self-healing ability through hydrogen bonding at the temperatures above upper critical solubility temperature, excellent mechanical properties (0.9 MPa), large stretchability (1300 %) and cut resistance. Next, as active material for electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) carbonized and ethanol/KOH activated polypyrrole nanotubes (acPPyNTs) were prepared. Symmetric self-healable supercapacitor employing p(NAGA-co-VTZ) hydrogel, acPPyNTs and aqueous 3M KCl solution was assembled. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements showed that the prepared device gave a specific capacitance of 282.62 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and high areal capacitance of 316.86 mF cm-2 at scan rate of 10 mV s-1. The supercapacitor operates over wide voltage window (0-1.2 V) and provides excellent cyclic performance with capacitance retention of 97 % after 10 000 cycles and 94 % after self-healing. Overall, the prepared self-healable supercapacitor appears to have considerable potential as high-performance energy storage device.</description>

      <title>Extending Radiowave Frequency Detection Range with Dressed States of Solid-State Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors using solid-state spin defects excel in the detection of radiofrequency (RF) fields, serving various purposes in communication, ranging, and sensing. For this purpose, pulsed dynamical decoupling (PDD) protocols are typically applied, which enhance sensitivity to RF signals. However, these methods are limited to frequencies of a few megahertz, which poses a challenge for sensing higher frequencies. We introduce an alternative approach based on a continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme involving dressed states of nitrogen vacancy (NV) ensemble spins driven within a microwave resonator. We compare the CDD methods to established PDD protocols and demonstrate the detection of RF signals up to $\sim$ 85 MHz, about ten times the current limit imposed by the PDD approach under identical conditions. Implementing the CDD method in a heterodyne synchronized protocol combines the high frequency detection with high spectral resolution. This advancement extends to various domains requiring detection in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ranges of the RF spectrum, including spin sensor-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy at high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Efficient and Polarization-Diversity Fiber-Chip Coupling by 2D Grating Couplers with 193-nm DUV Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) diffractive gratings offer a polarization-independent coupling solution between optical fibers and photonic integrated circuits, with advantages including placement flexibility, ease of fabrication, and tolerance to alignment errors. In this work, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a highly efficient 2D grating coupler fabricated with 193-nm deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography on the 220-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. An experimental peak coupling efficiency of -2.54 dB can be obtained using a minimum feature size of 180 nm, relying on the novel double-layer 2D grating structure. The proposed 2D waveguide grating is composed of a 70-nm shallow-etched hole array and a 160-nm-thick deposited polycrystalline silicon tooth array. The demonstrated design exhibits a 3-dB bandwidth of 23.4 nm with good positioning tolerance for optical fibers. Due to the benefits of perfectly vertical coupling configuration, the measured polarization-dependent loss in experiments is below 0.3 dB within the 3-dB working bandwidth. Our proposed double-layer 2D gratings can also be applied to other integrated optics platforms, where the grating directionality can be enhanced by optimizing the front-end-of-line process to break the vertical symmetry, thus enabling an efficient and polarization-independent coupling between optical fibers and photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Temperature-induced changes in optical properties of cubic CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$ using phonopy-FHI-aims</title>

Abstract: This research explores how temperature influences the optical characteristics of Cubic Methylammonium Tin Iodide (CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$), a material showing great promise for solar cell technology. The variations in the optical absorption coefficient, refractive index, extinction coefficient, reflectivity, and optical conductivity was examined over a range of temperatures and crystallographic orientations ([100], [010], [001]). The findings indicate that as temperature rises, there is a general decrease observed in the absorption coefficient, refractive index, extinction coefficient, and optical conductivity. Similarly, reflectivity also tends to decrease with increasing temperature. These findings suggest that Cubic CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$ exhibits consistent transparency, a stable refractive index, and relatively high reflectivity across different temperature conditions. Its low optical conductivity, typical of semiconductor materials, indicates its suitability for facilitating efficient charge separation and transport within solar cells. This research significantly adds to our comprehension of optical properties of CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$, paving the way for its potential use in solar cell applications.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Bound States in the Continuum in Coupled Helmholtz Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonant states underlie a variety of metastructures that exhibit remarkable capabilities for effective control of acoustic waves at subwavelength scales. The development of metamaterials relies on the rigorous mode engineering providing the implementation of the desired properties. At the same time, the application of metamaterials is still limited as their building blocks are frequently characterized by complicated geometry and can't be tuned easily. In this work, we consider a simple system of coupled Helmholtz resonators and study their properties associated with the tuning of coupling strength and symmetry breaking. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the excitation of quasi-bound state in the continuum in the resonators placed in a free space and in a rectangular cavity. It is also shown that tuning the intrinsic losses via introducing porous inserts can lead to spectral splitting or merging of quasi-\textit{bound states in the continuum} and occurrence of \textit{exceptional points}. The obtained results will open new opportunities for the development of simple and easy-tunable metastructures based on Helmholtz resonances.</description>

      <title>Generating multi-scale NMC particles with radial grain architectures using spatial stochastics and GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships of Li-ion battery cathodes is crucial for optimizing rate-performance and cycle-life resilience. However, correlating the morphology of cathode particles, such as in NMC811, and their inner grain architecture with electrode performance is challenging, particularly, due to the significant length-scale difference between grain and particle sizes. Experimentally, it is currently not feasible to image such a high number of particles with full granular detail to achieve representivity. A second challenge is that sufficiently high-resolution 3D imaging techniques remain expensive and are sparsely available at research institutions. To address these challenges, a stereological generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model fitting approach is presented that can generate representative 3D information from 2D data, enabling characterization of materials in 3D using cost-effective 2D data. Once calibrated, this multi-scale model is able to rapidly generate virtual cathode particles that are statistically similar to experimental data, and thus is suitable for virtual characterization and materials testing through numerical simulations. A large dataset of simulated particles with inner grain architecture has been made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Feasibility of two-line design of Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier aimed at increase of the allowed pump wave energy and hence the gain growth is analyzed and discussed. Serious restrictions follow from both the cyclic energy transfer of the pump, signal and idler waves in the coupled waveguide lines and the phase mismatch of the waves. Besides, impact of the artificial line discreteness on the phase mismatch is considered as well.</description>
