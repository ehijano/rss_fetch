      <title>Probing Conditions for Strong Clumping by the Streaming Instability: Small Dust Grains and Low Dust-to-gas Density Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability (SI) is a leading mechanism for concentrating solid particles into regions dense enough to form planetesimals. Its efficiency in clumping particles depends primarily on the dimensionless stopping time ($\tau_s$, a proxy for particle size) and dust-to-gas surface density ratio ($Z$). Previous simulations identified a critical $Z$ ($Z_{\rm{crit}}$) above which strong clumping occurs, where particle densities exceed the Hill density (thus satisfying a condition for gravitational collapse), over a wide range of $\tau_s$. These works found that for $\tau_s \leq 0.01$, $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ was above the ISM value $(\sim 0.01)$. In this work, we reexamine the clumping threshold using 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations at high resolution and with relatively large (compared to many previous simulations) domain sizes. Our main results are as follows: First, when $\tau_s = 0.01$, strong clumping occurs even at $Z \lesssim 0.01$, lower than $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ found in all previous studies. Consequently, we revise a previously published fit to the $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ curve to account for this updated $Z_{\rm{crit}}$. Second, higher resolution results in a thicker dust layer, which may result from other instabilities manifesting, such as the vertical shearing streaming instability. Third, despite this thicker layer, higher resolution can lead to strong clumping even with lower midplane dust-to-gas density ratios (which results from the thicker particle layer) so long as $Z \gtrsim Z_{\rm{crit}}$. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the SI in clumping small particles at $Z \sim 0.01$, which is a significant refinement of the conditions for planetesimal formation by the SI.</description>

      <title>CAMO-S: A meteor-tracking spectrograph at the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) mirror tracking system has been in operation since 2009 and has, to date, produced more than 20,000 two-station meteor observations at meter-level spatial and 10 ms temporal resolution. In 2020, a spectral tracking camera was added in parallel at one of the CAMO stations. To date, it has recorded the spectra of hundreds of faint meteors. Engineering testing from 2020-2023 resulted in the selection of a 150 lpmm grating and an EMCCD camera to achieve a spectral resolution of about 1 nm/pixel in the final configuration. The CAMO spectral system can resolve spectra from individual meteoroid fragments, record spectra for meteors of +2 peak magnitude to as faint as +4 in parts of the lightcurve and produce relative abundance estimates for Mg, Fe and Na. Our preliminary results also show identification of the H and K lines of CA(II). Meteors with strong iron lines were found to have unusual fragmentation behaviour, involving gross fragmentation rather than continuously shedding small particles. The spectra of individual fragments can be resolved in some cases, showing that these Fe-rich objects do not differ in composition among fragments. Our calibration procedure and hardware configuration are discussed together with preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Sealing Europa's vents by vapor deposition: An order of magnitude study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractures and vents in the ice crust of Europa, exposing the sub-surface ocean to the vacuum, might be responsible for the generation of planetary-scale water-vapor plumes. During its passage through the ice, the plume vapor is expected to partially condense on the walls, depositing until the vent is sealed. We develop a lumped-parameter model to analyze the sealing time scales. Neglecting all other possible mechanisms (water spillage, compression forces, etc.), we find shutting-off times compatible with the 7-hour plume observed in 2012 by the Hubble Space Telescope, suggesting that vapor deposition alone could have been responsible for sealing the vent. A map of sealing times vs. plume density, mass flow rate and aperture areas is given. Plume quantities from the literature are analyzed and compared to our results. For a given plume density/mass flow rate, small apertures would be sealed quickly by molecular deposition and are thus incompatible with observations.</description>

      <title>The HUSTLE Program: The UV to Near-Infrared HST WFC3/UVIS G280 Transmission Spectrum of WASP-127b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet wavelengths offer unique insights into aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. However, only a handful of exoplanets have been observed in the ultraviolet to date. Here, we present the ultraviolet-visible transmission spectrum of the inflated hot Jupiter WASP-127b. We observed one transit of WASP-127b with WFC3/UVIS G280 as part of the Hubble Ultraviolet-optical Survey of Transiting Legacy Exoplanets (HUSTLE), obtaining a transmission spectrum from 200-800 nm. Our reductions yielded a broad-band transit depth precision of 91 ppm and a median precision of 240 ppm across 59 spectral channels. Our observations are suggestive of a high-altitude cloud layer with forward modeling showing they are composed of sub-micron particles and retrievals indicating a high opacity patchy cloud. While our UVIS/G280 data only offers weak evidence for Na, adding archival HST WFC3/IR and STIS observations raises the overall Na detection significance to 4.1-sigma. Our work demonstrates the capabilities of HST WFC3/UVIS G280 observations to probe the aerosols and atmospheric composition of transiting hot Jupiters with comparable precision to HST STIS.</description>

      <title>Experimental Pathways for Detecting Double Superionicity in Planetary Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune are assumed to contain large amounts of planetary ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The properties of mixtures of such ices at the extreme pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors are not yet well understood. Ab initio computer simulations predicted that a number of ices exhibit a hydrogen superionic state and a doubly superionic state [DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-42958-0]. Since the latter state has not yet been generated with experiments, we outline here two possible pathways for reaching and detecting such a state with dynamic compression experiments. We suggest X-ray diffraction as the principal tool for detecting when the material becomes doubly superionic and the sublattice of one of the heavy nuclei melts. That would require a temperature of $\sim$3500 K and pressures greater than $\sim$200 GPa for H$_3$NO$_4$, which we use as an example material here. Such conditions can be reached with experiments that employ an initial shock that is followed by a ramp compression wave. Alternatively, one may use triple-shock compression because a single shock does not yield sufficiently high densities.</description>

      <title>Under the magnifying glass: A combined 3D model applied to cloudy warm Saturn type exoplanets around M-dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm Saturn type exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs are particularly suitable for in-depth cloud characterisation through transmission spectroscopy due to their favourable stellar to planetary radius contrast. However, modelling cloud formation consistently within the 3D atmosphere remains computationally challenging. The aim is to explore the combined atmospheric and micro-physical cloud structure, and the kinetic gas-phase chemistry for the warm Saturn HATS0-6b orbiting an M-dwarf. A combined 3D cloudy atmosphere model is constructed by iteratively executing the 3D General Circulation Model (GCM) expeRT/MITgcm and a kinetic cloud formation model, each in its full complexity. Resulting cloud particle number densities, sizes, and compositions are used to derive the local cloud opacity which is then utilised in the next GCM iteration. The disequilibrium H/C/O/N gas-phase chemistry is calculated for each iteration to assess the resulting transmission spectrum in post-processing. The cloud opacity feedback causes a temperature inversion at the sub-stellar point and at the evening terminator at gas pressures higher than 0.01 bar. Furthermore, clouds cool the atmosphere between 0.01 bar and 10 bar, and narrow the equatorial wind jet. The transmission spectrum shows muted gas-phase absorption and a cloud particle silicate feature at approximately 10 micron. The combined atmosphere-cloud model retains the full physical complexity of each component and therefore enables a detailed physical interpretation with JWST NIRSpec and MIRI LRS observational accuracy. The model shows that warm Saturn type exoplanets around M-dwarfs are ideal candidates to search for limb asymmetries in clouds and chemistry, identify cloud particle composition by observing their spectral features, and identify the cloud-induced strong thermal inversion that arises on these planets specifically.</description>

      <title>Linking the primordial composition of planet building disks to the present-day composition of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of rocky planets is strongly driven by the primordial materials in the protoplanetary disk, which can be inferred from the abundances of the host star. Understanding this compositional link is crucial for characterizing exoplanets. We aim to investigate the relationship between the compositions of low-mass planets and their host stars. We determined the primordial compositions of host stars using high-precision present-day stellar abundances and stellar evolutionary models. These primordial abundances were then input into a stoichiometric model to estimate the composition of planet-building blocks. Additionally, we employed a three-component planetary interior model (core, mantle, water in different phases) to estimate planetary compositions based only on their radius and mass. We found that although stellar abundances vary over time, relevant abundance ratios like Fe/Mg remain relatively constant during the main sequence evolution for low temperature stars. A strong correlation is found between the iron-to-silicate mass fraction of protoplanetary disks and planets, while no significant correlation was observed for water mass fractions. The Fe/Mg ratio varies significantly between planets and their stars, indicating substantial disk-driven compositional diversity, and this ratio also correlates with planetary radius. While stellar abundances, as a proxy of the composition of protoplanetary disk, provide a baseline for planetary composition, significant deviations arise due to complex disk processes, challenging the assumption of a direct, one-to-one elemental relationship between stars and their planets.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Reveals the Nested Morphology of Disk Winds from Young Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radially extended disk winds could be the key to unlocking how protoplanetary disks accrete and how planets form and migrate. A distinctive characteristic is their nested morphology of velocity and chemistry. Here we report JWST/NIRSpec spectro-imaging of four young stars with edge-on disks in the Taurus star-forming region that demonstrate the ubiquity of this structure. In each source, a fast collimated jet traced by [Fe II] is nested inside a hollow cavity within wider lower-velocity H2 and, in one case, also CO ro-vibrational (v=1-0) emission. Furthermore, in one of our sources, ALMA CO(2-1) emission, paired with our NIRSpec images, reveals the nested wind structure extends further outward. This nested wind morphology strongly supports theoretical predictions for wind-driven accretion and underscores the need for theoretical work to assess the role of winds in the formation and evolution of planetary systems</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the sub-stellar boundary, signatures of magnetic fields begin to manifest at radio wavelengths, analogous to the auroral emission of the magnetised solar system planets. This emission provides a singular avenue for measuring magnetic fields at planetary scales in extrasolar systems. So far, exoplanets have eluded detection at radio wavelengths. However, ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), their higher mass counterparts, have been detected for over two decades in the radio. Given their similar characteristics to massive exoplanets, UCDs are ideal targets to bridge our understanding of magnetic field generation from stars to planets. In this work, we develop a new tomographic technique for inverting both the viewing angle and large-scale magnetic field structure of UCDs from observations of coherent radio bursts. We apply our methodology to the nearby T8 dwarf WISE J062309.94-045624.6 (J0623) which was recently detected at radio wavelengths, and show that it is likely viewed pole-on. We also find that J0623's rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned significantly, reminiscent of Uranus and Neptune, and show that it may be undergoing a magnetic cycle with a period exceeding 6 months in duration. These findings demonstrate that our method is a robust new tool for studying magnetic fields on planetary-mass objects. With the advent of next-generation low-frequency radio facilities, the methods presented here could facilitate the characterisation of exoplanetary magnetospheres for the first time.</description>

      <title>Corotation-bounce resonance of ions in Jupiter's magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banded energy distributions of H$^{+}$, O$^{++}$, S$^{+++}$, and O$^+$ or S$^{++}$ ions between 100 eV to ~20 keV are consistently observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere mapping to M-shells between M=10-20. The bands correspond to flux enhancements at similar speeds for different ion species, providing the first evidence of simultaneous bounce-resonant acceleration of multiple ion species in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ion enhancements occur for energies at which the bounce frequencies of the trapped ions matched integer harmonics of the System-III corotation frequency. The observations highlight a previously unknown interaction between corotation and bounce motion of &lt;10 keV energy ions that is a fundamental and persistent process occurring in Jupiter's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>Using the Ca II lines in T Tauri stars to infer the abundance of refractory elements in the innermost disk regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the abundance of calcium in the innermost disk of 70 T Tauri stars in the star-forming regions of Chamaeleon I, Lupus and Orion OB1b. We use calcium as a proxy for the refractory material that reaches the inner disk. We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca II emission lines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed from the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming regions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] &lt; -0.30 relative to the solar abundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion, consistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca depletion ([Ca/H] &lt; -0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some of those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no correlation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the mass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer disks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass reservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in the outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our results of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively consistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift including partitioning of elements and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of solids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.</description>

      <title>Scaling with the Stars: The emergence of marginal stability in low Prandtl number turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve models of the structure and evolution of stellar and planetary interiors, it is important to quantify transport by strongly stratified turbulence in low Prandtl number fluids. Recent numerical studies have shown evidence for scale-separated dynamics in strongly anisotropic flows. Motivated by these results, in the first part of this report we perform a multiscale analysis of the governing equations and identify regimes of behaviour. In the second part, we apply algorithms for solving slow-fast quasilinear systems to our reduced-order systems for low Prandtl number fluids and demonstrate their approach to and maintenance of marginal stability. This is a Fellow's Report for the 2022 Program of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer School.</description>

      <title>HIP 8522: A Puzzling Young Solar Twin with the Lowest Detected Lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HIP 8522, a young solar twin with the lowest detected lithium, potentially a field blue straggler or the result of episodic early accretion. Its stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff} = 5729 \pm 7$ K, $\log g = 4.532 \pm 0.016$ dex, $\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.005 \pm 0.010$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.08 \pm 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$) and chemical composition were determined via spectroscopic equilibrium using high resolution spectra ($R = 60~000-165~000$). The age of HIP 8522 was estimated to be an upper limit of $&lt;$1 Gyr through isochrone fitting and was further confirmed using chemical clocks. Spectral synthesis of the lithium line at $\sim$6707.8 \AA\ yielded an upper lithium abundance limit of $A(\rm{Li}) &lt;$ 0.8 dex. This value is unusually low for solar twins of similar age, which typically have $A(\rm{Li})$ values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3 dex, suggesting that $\sim$2 dex of lithium is missing. We investigate various scenarios, such as planet engulfment, sub-stellar mergers, and extra mixing. However, two distinct hypotheses provide plausible explanations for the significant depletion of lithium: one suggests that HIP 8522 is a field blue straggler formed by the merger of a close binary, while the other proposes that HIP 8522 experienced early episodic accretion. The young solar twin HIP 8522 presents an exceptional opportunity to rigorously test stellar evolution models and gain crucial insights into the internal mixing mechanisms responsible for the significant destruction of lithium.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge, phase II: Comparison of algorithms in terms of characterization capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this communication, we report on the results of the second phase of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge started in 2019. This second phase focuses on the characterization of point sources (exoplanet signals) within multispectral high-contrast images from ground-based telescopes. We collected eight data sets from two high-contrast integral field spectrographs (namely Gemini-S/GPI and VLT/SPHERE-IFS) that we calibrated homogeneously, and in which we injected a handful of synthetic planetary signals (ground truth) to be characterized by the data challenge participants. The tasks of the participants consist of (1) extracting the precise astrometry of each injected planetary signals, and (2) extracting the precise spectro-photometry of each injected planetary signal. Additionally, the participants may provide the 1-sigma uncertainties on their estimation for further analyses. When available, the participants can also provide the posterior distribution used to estimate the position/spectrum and uncertainties. The data are permanently available on a Zenodo repository and the participants can submit their results through the EvalAI platform. The EvalAI submission platform opened on April 2022 and closed on the 31st of May 2024. In total, we received 4 valid submissions for the astrometry estimation and 4 valid submissions for the spectrophotometry (each submission, corresponding to one pipeline, has been submitted by a unique participant). In this communication, we present an analysis and interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>Transient Phenomena of Mercury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The similarity of Mercury to the Moon raises the question on mercurian analogues of lunar transient phenomena. However, since the mid-1960s, this topic has remained out of attention. Nevertheless, the discoveries of the 21st century and the BepiColombo mission give hope for the registration of Mercury transient phenomena. In this regard, it is shown that there are forgotten earth-based observations of anomalous phenomena on Mercury, which now fit into modern knowledge about this planet. Therefore, ALPO could contribute to this mysterious aspect of space exploration.</description>

      <title>Pursuing Truth: Improving Retrievals on Mid-Infrared Exo-Earth Spectra with Physically Motivated Water Abundance Profiles and Cloud Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds affect retrievals. In a first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure-temperature structure, and the abundances of $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, and $\mathrm{O_3}$. Further, at $R=100$, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature $\mathrm{CH_4}$ becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.</description>

      <title>No Thick Atmosphere on the Terrestrial Exoplanet Gl 486b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primary science goal for JWST is to detect and characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs (M-Earths). The existence of atmospheres on M-Earths is highly uncertain because their host stars' extended history of high XUV irradiation may act to completely remove their atmospheres. We present two JWST secondary eclipse observations of the M-Earth Gl 486b (also known as GJ 486b) between 5-12 $\mu$m. We combined these observations with a precise analysis of the host star parameters to derive a planetary dayside temperature of $T_{p}=865 \pm 14$ K. We compared this temperature to the maximum expected temperature for a zero albedo, zero heat redistribution bare rock and derived a temperature ratio of $R=\frac{T_{p,dayside}}{T_{p,max}}=0.97 \pm 0.01$. This value is consistent with an airless body with a slight non-zero albedo or a thin atmosphere with $&lt;1$% H$_{2}$O or $&lt;1$ ppm CO$_{2}$. However, it is inconsistent with an Earth- or Venus-like atmosphere, and the spectrum shows no clear emission or absorption features. Additionally, our observations are inconsistent with the water-rich atmospheric scenario allowed by previous transit observations and suggest the transmission spectrum was instead shaped by stellar contamination (Moran et al. 2023). Given the potential for atmospheric escape throughout the system's $\geq6.6$-Gyr lifetime (Diamond-Lowe et al. 2024), we conclude that the observations are likely best explained by an airless planet. This result is the most precise measurement yet of terrestrial exoplanet thermal emission with JWST, which places a strong constraint on the position of the "Cosmic Shoreline" between airless bodies and those with atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Disequilibrium Chemistry, Diabatic Thermal Structure, and Clouds in the Atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Located 10.888 pc from Earth, COCONUTS-2b is a planetary-mass companion to a young (150-800 Myr) M3 star, with a wide orbital separation (6471 au) and a low companion-to-host mass ratio ($0.021\pm0.005$). We have studied the atmospheric properties of COCONUTS-2b using newly acquired 1.0-2.5 $\mu$m spectroscopy from Gemini/Flamingos-2. The spectral type of COCONUTS-2b is refined to T$9.5 \pm 0.5$ based on comparisons with T/Y dwarf spectral templates. We have conducted an extensive forward-modeling analysis, comparing the near-infrared spectrum and mid-infrared broadband photometry with sixteen state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids developed for brown dwarfs and self-luminous exoplanets near the T/Y transition. The PH$_{3}$-free ATMO2020++, ATMO2020++, and Exo-REM models best match the specific observations of COCONUTS-2b, regardless of variations in the input spectrophotometry. This analysis suggests the presence of disequilibrium chemistry, along with a diabatic thermal structure and/or clouds, in the atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b. All models predict fainter $Y$-band fluxes than observed, highlighting uncertainties in the alkali chemistry models and opacities. We determine a bolometric luminosity of $\log{(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot})}=-6.18$ dex, with a 0.5 dex-wide range of $[-6.43,-5.93]$ dex that accounts for various assumptions of models. Using thermal evolution models, we derive an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=483^{+44}_{-53}$ K, a surface gravity of $\log{(g)}=4.19^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ dex, a radius of $R=1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, and a mass of $M=8 \pm 2$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. Various atmospheric model grids consistently indicate that COCONUTS-2b's atmosphere has sub- or near-solar metallicity and C/O. These findings provide valuable insights into COCONUTS-2b's formation history and the potential outward migration to its current wide orbit.</description>

      <title>Making Habitable Worlds: Planets Versus Megastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2016, a star KIC 8462852 caught the world's attention due to a paper by citizen scientists who noticed its seemingly unexplainable brightness variations. The forward theory was offered - KIC 8462852 is surrounded by a Dyson sphere, a megastructure made by an alien civilization to collect all energy output from their star. Finally, in 2018, its light curve showed chromaticity more characteristic of the dust (from comets or asteroids) rather than of something made from solid material, but the world was woken up to the idea of megastructures. But, in Dyson's time, only Solar System planets were known; it took more than 20 years to realize that nature has no problem making planets and does it with a flair -- the total number of planets in the Galaxy is estimated to be in billions. With such abundance of planets, there would be no need to destroy the entire planetary system to make one sphere. Instead, a civilization can expand to a system that has planet(s) in the habitable zone (HZ), or a planet can be moved into it. Alternatively, a free-floating planet (FFP) can be captured and moved into the HZ. These shifts can be performed at a constant low-thrust acceleration using high power directional lasers, resulting in a gradual spiral transfer from one orbit to another. We propose here to search for ETI by looking for high-power laser technosignatures and consider merits of such signatures. We suggest to specifically pay attention to the multiple planetary systems that have Strange Exoplanetary Architectures (SEA) - unusual planetary arrangements that cannot be explained by current planetary formation theories, because these could be the result of ETI moving planets intentionally to suit their needs.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids under Earth's upper mantle conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the crucial biomolecules could be abiotically synthesized from geofluids in the deep interior of Earth and other planets and these formed biomolecules could potentially contribute to the early stage of the emergency of life.</description>
