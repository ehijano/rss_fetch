      <title>Energetics-based model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a mathematical model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet, which is floating at a liquid surface and is driven by the surface tension gradient originating from the surface concentration field of the chemicals that are emitted from the droplet. We define the free energy of the system by including the surface and line energies. From the calculation of the functional of the free energy, we obtain a mathematical model for the diffusiophoretic motion with deformation. By only considering the deformation of the second mode, we explicitly derived the time-evolution equations for the translational motion and the elliptic deformation. We found three stable states: an immobile circular droplet, an immobile elliptically deformed droplet, and a moving droplet with the elliptic deformation in which the minor axis meets the motion direction, and discussed the transition between these three stable states.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear periodic orbit solutions and their bifurcation structure at the origin of soliton hopping in coupled microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microresonator frequency combs, essential for future integrated optical systems, rely on dissipative Kerr solitons generated in a single microresonator to achieve coherent frequency comb generation. Recent advances in the nanofabrication of low-loss integrated nonlinear microresonators have paved the way for the exploration of coupled-resonator systems. These systems provide significant technological advantages, including higher conversion efficiency and the generation of dual dispersive waves. Beyond their practical benefits, coupled-resonator systems also reveal novel emergent nonlinear phenomena, such as soliton hopping, a dynamic process in which solitons periodically transfer between coupled resonators. In this study, we employ a dynamical system approach and the corresponding well-established numerical techniques, extensively developed within the context of hydrodynamics and transitional turbulence, to investigate the bifurcation structure of periodic orbit solutions of the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations that underlie soliton hopping in photonic dimers and trimers. Our main finding uncovers a fundamental difference in the origin of the hopping process in dimers and trimers. We demonstrate that in dimers, hopping emerges from a branch of stable soliton solutions, whereas in trimers, it originates from an unstable branch. This distinction leads to a significant difference in pump power requirements. We relate the bifurcation structure of the periodic orbits including their stability to the observed dynamics in simulated laser scans mimicking typical experimental investigations. Subcritical Hopf bifurcations of unstable equilibrium branches specifically explain observed hysteresis, the coexistence of multiple attractors at the same parameter values, and the importance of choosing a specific path in parameter space to reliably achieve a desired dynamical regime.</description>

      <title>Collision-Free Bearing-Driven Formation Tracking for Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of tracking formations driven by bearings for heterogeneous Euler-Lagrange systems with parametric uncertainty in the presence of multiple moving leaders. To estimate the leaders' velocities and accelerations, we first design a distributed observer for the leader system, utilizing a bearing-based localization condition in place of the conventional connectivity assumption. This observer, coupled with an adaptive mechanism, enables the synthesis of a novel distributed control law that guides the formation towards the target formation, without requiring prior knowledge of the system parameters. Furthermore, we establish a sufficient condition, dependent on the initial formation configuration, that ensures collision avoidance throughout the formation evolution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>
