      <title>Gate-tunable Bose-Fermi mixture in a strongly correlated moir\'e bilayer electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gases consisting of species with distinct quantum statistics, such as Bose-Fermi mixtures, can behave in a fundamentally different way than their unmixed constituents. This makes them an essential platform for studying emergent quantum many-body phenomena such as mediated interactions and unconventional pairing. Here, we realize an equilibrium Bose-Fermi mixture in a bilayer electron system implemented in a WS$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ moir\'e heterobilayer with strong Coulomb coupling to a nearby moir\'e-free WSe$_{2}$ monolayer. Absent the fermionic component, the underlying bosonic phase manifests as a dipolar excitonic insulator. By injecting excess charges into it, we show that the bosonic phase forms a stable mixture with added electrons but abruptly collapses upon hole doping. We develop a microscopic model to explain the unusual asymmetric stability with respect to electron and hole doping. By studying the Bose-Fermi mixture via monitoring excitonic resonances from both layers, we demonstrate gate-tunability over a wide range in the boson/fermion density phase space, in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations. Our results further the understanding of phases stabilized in moir\'e bilayer electron systems and demonstrate their potential for exploring the exotic properties of equilibrium Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>RIXS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer spin chain by employing a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. Utilizing the Krylov-space correction-vector method in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we calculate both the direct and indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra for the trimer spin chain. To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a theoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are then utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the single-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that the single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy levels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations. Furthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS process, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the various two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our calculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized (spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin chain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay of these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength. The computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of experimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current capabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas with symmetric dual-gate screening: exchange-correlation functional and other ground-state properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) homogeneous electron gas (HEG) is a fundamental model in quantum many-body physics. It is important to theoretical and computational studies, where exchange-correlation energies computed in it serve as the foundation for density-functional calculations. It is also of direct relevance to a variety of experimental settings, especially with the rapid recent growth in 2D materials and moir\'e systems. In these experiments, metallic gates are often present, which screen the Coulomb interaction between electrons. The effect of the screening can qualitatively change the behavior of the 2D HEG, and requires accurate many-body computations to capture. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations in the 2D HEG subjected to symmetric dual-gate screening. We systematically compute the correlation energy across a range of densities and gate separations for both spin unpolarized and fully polarized systems. A global fit is obtained for the correlation energy, using these data and imposing various limiting behaviors obtained from perturbation analysis. The new functional will allow density-functional calculations to be performed for a variety of realistic experimental setups which can accurately account for the presence of gates. We also investigate how the gate screening affects the bulk modulus, pair correlation function, and the structure factor of the 2D HEG, which can potentially be probed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of effective pairing interactions in a doped band insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pairing state in a doped band insulator under a periodic driving field. We employ a correlated fermionic model on a honeycomb lattice, in which a pairing glue is obtainable via repulsive interactions, and derive an effective model under circularly polarized light. We demonstrate that the effective pairing interaction for doped fermions obtained by the second-order perturbation theory is tunable by the frequency and amplitude of the driving field. We find the optimal frequency range to enhance the pairing interaction and show that the modified effective system can strengthen the two-body bound state. Our study suggests that external driving light can reinforce superconducting pair states in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Effect Accompanying Quantum Hall Effect: Landau Levels Cause Orbital Polarized Edge Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect emerges when two-dimensional samples are subjected to strong magnetic fields at low temperatures: Topologically protected edge states cause a quantized Hall conductivity in multiples of $e^2/h$. Here we show that the quantum Hall effect is accompanied by an orbital Hall effect. Our quantum mechanical calculations fit well the semiclassical interpretation in terms of "skipping orbits". The chiral edge states of a quantum Hall system are orbital polarized akin to a hypothetical orbital version of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic systems. The orbital Hall resistivity scales quadratically with the magnetic field making it the dominant effect at high fields.</description>

      <title>Induced quantum magnetism on a triangular lattice of non-Kramers ions in PrMgAl11O19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic properties of the quantum triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) PrMgAl11O19 through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Strong magnetic anisotropy indicates the realization of an Ising-like magnetism in PrMgAl11O19 single crystal while no long-range magnetic ordering is realized down to 0.4 K. The splitting of the low-lying quasi-doublet into two singlets suggested by experimental data, is consistent with an effective pseudospin-1/2 scenario. The observed gapless excitations in zero field are attributed to induced quantum magnetism, they would be induced by magnetic interactions of an energy scale comparable with the splitting between the two singlets. Based on these results, we modeled the magnetic ground state of PrMgAl11O19 by a quantum Ising magnet with an intrinsic transverse field rather than a quantum spin liquid (QSL). In addition, our data show a non-monotonous response of the low-temperature specific heat to the external fields revealing a complex interplay between intrinsic and external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Site-selective correlations in interacting "flat-band" quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model lattices such as the kagome and Lieb lattices have been widely investigated to elucidate the properties of interacting flat-band systems. While a quasicrystal does not have proper bands, the non-interacting density of states of several of them displays the typical signature of a flat band pinned at the Fermi level: a delta-function zero-energy peak. Here, we employ quantum Monte Carlo simulations to determine the effect of onsite repulsion on these quasicrystals. While global properties such as the antiferromagnetic structure factor and the specific heat behave similarly as in the case of periodic lattices undergoing a Mott transition, the behavior of the local density of states depends on the coordination number of the site. In particular, sites with the smallest coordination number, which give the dominant spectral-weight contribution to the zero-energy peak, are the ones most strongly impacted by the interaction. Besides establishing site-selective correlations in quasicrystals, our work also points to the importance of the real-space structure of flat bands in interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $n$-circuits are series-parallel networks composed of exactly $n$ unit resistors. This paper is focused on evaluating the mean resistance of all $n$-circuits, $M_n$, establishing that it lies between $1$ and $4.3954$ for all $n$. We ultimately conjecture that $M_n$ converges to $1.25$ as $n$ grows, based on computational analysis and other intuitive arguments. Although the number of $n$-circuits has been explored quite thoroughly, this paper also provides complete proofs of some important results.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Universality of the Many-Body Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the spectral form factor (SFF) of the resulting circuit ensemble can be computed exactly without numerical sampling. In the case of the circular unitary ensemble (CUE) we report an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for arbitrary system sizes, and show that it grows through a sequence of exponential ramps. Using exact numerical methods, we find that the circular orthogonal and symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively) also lead to exponential growth of the SFF. This exponential growth is characteristic of non-interacting systems with random matrix statistics at the $\textit{single-particle}$ level and, upon introducing interactions, crosses over to a linear ramp consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-conserving dynamics of non-interacting fermions monitored by local charge measurements have been shown to possess in 1D space only an area-law-entangled phase, with no measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). This phenomenon was elegantly explained by an effective replica field theory given by a non-linear sigma model featuring large replica symmetries. In this work, we focus on the charge-conserving monitored dynamics of interacting fermions in 1D. Using a unifying replica Keldysh field theory, we show that more dynamical phases and transitions emerge owing to the reduction of replica symmetry when interactions are introduced. The reduced symmetry combines a discrete replica permutation symmetry and the charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT between area-law and volume-law entanglement scalings, which can be described by a separatrix in the weak-coupling renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the Kosterlitz-Thouless type ``charge-sharpening" transition between the two kinds of dynamics where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the local measurements. All the relevant phases and transitions can be understood within the same unifying field theory. Additionally, this field theory provides insight into why the charge-sharpening transition should only happen in the presence of volume-law entanglement scaling. Moreover, we show that our field theory, despite being constructed using the Keldysh formalism, is equivalent to a statistical mechanics model that describes the (replicated) time-evolution of the system's density matrix mapped to a doubled Hilbert space under the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. This equivalence is the result of the trivialization of the fermion distribution function by measurement-induced heating effects.</description>

      <title>Single-particle spectral function of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are the most prominent example of states with topological order, hosting excitations with fractionalized charge. Recent experiments in twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ and graphene-based heterostructures provide evidence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and persist even without an external magnetic field. Understanding the unique properties of these states requires the characterization of their low-energy excitations. To that end, we construct a parton theory for the energy and momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of FQAH states. We explicitly consider several experimentally observed filling fractions as well as a composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Chern band. The parton description captures qualitatively our numerical exact diagonalization results. Additionally, we discuss how the finite bandwidth of the Chern band and the non-ideal quantum geometry affect the fractionalized excitations. Our work demonstrates that the energy and momentum-resolved electronic single-particle spectral function provides a valuable tool to characterize fractionalized excitations of FQAH states in moir\'e lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes subdiffusively. The slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.</description>

      <title>Absence of "fractional ac Josephson effect" in superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of ac Josephson effect in superconducting junctions described by an arbitrary scattering matrix that may include magnetic effects. In the limit of constant in time bias voltage $V$ applied to the junction we derive a formally exact current-phase relation (CPR) that is manifestly $2\pi$-periodic in the Josephson phase $\varphi$ in full accordance with general principles. This our result unambiguously argues against the idea of the so-called "fractional ac Josephson effect" admitting $4\pi$-periodic in $\varphi$ CPR. We also demonstrate that at any non-zero $V$ quantum dynamics of Andreev bound states becomes non-Hermitian which signals their instability, thus making any 'quasi-equilibrium' description of ac Josephson effect unreliable. We specifically address the limit of highly transparent junctions with magnetic scattering where -- along with super- and excess current terms -- at small $V$ we also recover a non-trivial $2\pi$-periodic dissipative current with the amplitude $\propto |V|^{1/3}$</description>

      <title>Simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model with long-range hopping on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance and accuracy of digital quantum algorithms for the study of static and dynamic properties of the fermionic Hubbard model at half-filling with next-nearest neighbour hopping terms. We provide quantum circuits to perform ground and excited states calculations, via the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Equation of Motion (qEOM) approach respectively, as well as product formulas decompositions for time evolution. We benchmark our approach on a chain with L=6 sites and periodic boundary conditions, computing the charge and spin gaps, the spectral function and spin-spin dynamic correlations. Our results for the ground state phase diagram are in qualitative agreement with known results in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we provide concrete scalings for the number of gates needed to implement our protocols on a qubit register with all-to-all connectivities and on a heavy hexagonal coupling map.</description>

      <title>Signature of Superconductivity in Pressurized Trilayer-nickelate Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$</title>

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has drawn extensive attention. Herein, we report systematic investigations on the evolutions of structure, magnetism, and electrical resistance of Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ polycrystalline samples under various pressures. Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ exhibits density wave transitions on Ni and Pr sublattices at about 158 K and 4.3 K, respectively, and the density wave can be progressively suppressed by pressure. A structural transformation from the monoclinic $P2_1/a$ space group to the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ occurs at around 20 GPa. An apparent drop in resistance with evident magnetic field dependence is observed as pressure above 20 GPa, indicating the emergence of superconductivity in Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ polycrystalline samples. The discovery of the signature of superconductivity in Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ broadens the family of nickelate superconductors and provides a new platform for investigating the mechanisms of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases of nickelates.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions from a Schwinger-Keldysh effective action, resummed in derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. We discuss the applicability of our results to the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and global symmetry $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong $\mathcal{S}$ and weak $\mathcal{G}$ symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted Renyi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs.</description>

      <title>Exact results of one-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00890v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytical results of fundamental properties of one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model with a repulsive interaction, ranging from fractional excitations to universal thermodynamics, interaction-driven criticality, correlation functions, Contact susceptibilities and quantum cooling. Using the exact solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations of the Hubbard model, we first rigorously calculate the gapless spin and charge excitations, exhibiting exotic features of fractionalized spinons and holons. Based on the analysis on the fractional charge and spin excitations, the spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid with only the charge propagation mode is elucidated by the asymptotic of the two-point correlation functions with the help of the conformal field theory. Near quadruple critical point, we then further analytically obtain the thermodynamical properties, dimensionless ratios and scaling functions near quantum phase transitions in terms of chemical potential, magnetic field and interaction. In particular, we determine additivity rules of spin and charge susceptibilities, and derive explicit forms of thermodynamics of spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid. Finally, in order to capture deeper insight into the Mott insulator and interaction driven criticality, we further study the double occupancy and its associated Contact and Contact susceptibilities through which an adiabatic cooling scheme upon the quantum criticality is introduced.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate magnetic order: A fingerprint for electronic correlations in hole-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intertwined charge and magnetic fluctuations in high-$T_\text{c}$ copper oxide superconductors (cuprates) are hypothesized to be a consequence of their correlated electronic nature. Among other observables, this is apparent in the doping dependence of incommensurate magnetic order, known as the Yamada relation (YR). We analyze the Hubbard model to challenge the universality of YR as a function of interaction strength $U$ through Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson (SB) mean-field theory and truncated unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG). While TUFRG tends to lock in to a doping dependence of the incommensurate magnetic ordering vector obtained for the perturbative weak-coupling limit, SB not only exhibits an enhanced sensitivity upon a variation of $U$ from weak to strong coupling, but also shows good agreement with experimental data. It supports the placement of weakly hole-doped cuprates in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime.</description>

Abstract: We study the many-body ground states of three-component quantum particles in two prototypical topological lattice models under strong intercomponent and intracomponent repulsions. At band filling $\nu=3/4$ for hardcore bosons, we demonstrate the emergence of three-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect characterized by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix, through exact diagonalization study of four-fold quasidegenerate ground states with a robust spectrum gap and the combined density-matrix renormalization group calculation of fractional drag charge pumping. Further we formulate the topological characterization of FQH states of three-component Bose-Fermi mixtures at various fillings by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix. At last we discuss the possible generalization of our approach to identify non-Abelian three-component spin-singlet FQH states.</description>

      <title>Method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>

Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a novel method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

      <title>Detecting axion dynamics on the surface of magnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions, initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem, have recently gained attention in condensed matter physics, particularly in topological insulators. However, detecting axion dynamics has proven challenging, with no experimental confirmations to date. In this study, we identify the surface of magnetic topological insulators as an ideal platform for observing axion dynamics. The vanishing bulk gap at the surface allows for order $O(1)$ variations in the axion field, making the detection of axion-like phenomena more feasible. In contrast, these phenomena are strongly suppressed in the bulk due to the small magnetic exchange gap. We investigate two-photon decay as a signature of axion dynamics and calculate the branching ratio using a perturbative approach. Our findings reveal that the photon flux emitted from the surface is in-plane and orders of magnitude larger than that from the bulk, making it detectable with modern microwave technology. We also discuss potential material platforms for detecting axion two-photon decay and strategies to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>

      <title>Effect of dynamical electron correlations on the tunnelling magnetoresistance of Fe/MgO/Fe(001) junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the non-equilibrium Green's function technique to investigate the steady-state transport properties of an Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), focusing on the impact of dynamical electron correlations on the Fe $3d$ orbitals. By applying the rigid shift approximation, we extend the calculations from zero- to finite-bias in a simple and computationally efficient manner, obtaining the bias-dependent electronic structure and current-versus-voltage characteristic curve in both the parallel and antiparallel configurations. In particular, we find that dynamical electron correlation manifests as a reduction in the spin splitting of the Fe $3d_{z^2}$ state compared to DFT predictions and introduces a finite relaxation time. The impact of these effects on the transport properties, however, varies significantly between magnetic configurations. In the parallel configuration, the characteristic curves obtained with DFT and DMFT are similar, as the transport is mostly due to the coherent transmission of spin-up electrons through the MgO barrier. Conversely, in the antiparallel configuration, correlation effects become more significant, with DMFT predicting a sharp current increase due to bias-driven inelastic electron-electron scattering. As a consequence, DMFT gives a lower bias threshold for the suppression of the tunneling magnetoresistance ratio compared to DFT, matching experimental data more closely.</description>

      <title>Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of twisted bilayer cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer cuprates (TBC) as a function of electron density and layer twist angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles in TBC away from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.</description>

      <title>Detecting Multipartite Entanglement Patterns using Single Particle Green's Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol for detecting multipartite entanglement in itinerant many-body electronic systems using single particle Green's functions. To achieve this, we first establish a connection between the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and single particle Green's functions by constructing a set of witness operators built out of single electron creation and destruction operators in a doubled system. This set of witness operators is indexed by a momenta $k$. We compute the QFI for these witness operators and show that for thermal ensembles it can be expressed as an auto-convolution of the single particle spectral function. We then apply our framework to a one-dimensional fermionic system to showcase its effectiveness in detecting entanglement in itinerant electron models. We observe that the detected entanglement level is sensitive to the wave vector associated with witness operator. Our protocol will permit detecting entanglement in many-body systems using scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, two spectroscopies that measure the single particle Green's function. It offers the prospect of the experimental detection of entanglement through spectroscopies beyond the established route of measuring the dynamical spin response.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation implies symmetry-protected topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which significantly extends a previous approach in a specific noise model to arbitrary noisy models. In our constructions, it is crucial to use the QSVT-based FPAA, demonstrating for the first time the separation between any other amplitude amplification algorithms and the QSVT-based one in the application. We also show that the proposed decoders have high decoding performance and reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic ab initio methods for infinite nuclear matter with modern chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the equation of state for pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter is presented using three ab initio methods based on diagrammatic expansions: coupled-cluster theory, self-consistent Green's functions, and many-body perturbation theory. We critically evaluate these methods by employing different chiral potentials at next-to-next-to-leading-order -- all of which include both two- and three-nucleon contributions -- and by exploring various many-body truncations. Our investigation yields highly precise results for pure neutron matter and robust predictions for symmetric nuclear matter, particularly with soft interactions. Moreover, the new calculations demonstrate that the $\rm{ NNLO_{sat} }(450)$ and $\Delta \rm{NNLO_{go}}(394)$ potentials are consistent with the empirical constraints on the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, this benchmark study reveals that diagrammatic expansions with similar architectures lead to consistent many-body correlations, even when applied across different methods. This consistency underscores the robustness of the diagrammatic approach in capturing the essential physics of nucleonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice and generate the Onsager algebra, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. The chiral anomaly is matched by this non-abelian algebra, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XX model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.</description>
