      <title>On some relationships between the centers and the derived ideal in Leibniz 3-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the classic results of group theory is the so-called Schur theorem. It states that if the central factor-group $G/\zeta(G)$ of a group $G$ is finite, then its derived subgroup $[G,G]$ is also finite. This result has numerous generalizations and modifications in group theory. At the same time, similar investigations were conducted in other algebraic structures. In 2016, L.A. Kurdachenko, J. Otal and O.O. Pypka proved an analogue of Schur theorem for Leibniz algebras: if central factor-algebra $L/\zeta(L)$ of Leibniz algebra $L$ has finite dimension, then its derived ideal $[L,L]$ is also finite-dimensional. Moreover, they also proved a slightly modified analogue of Schur theorem: if the codimensions of the left $\zeta^{l}(L)$ and right $\zeta^{r}(L)$ centers of Leibniz algebra $L$ are finite, then its derived ideal $[L,L]$ is also finite-dimensional. One of the generalizations of Leibniz algebras is the so-called Leibniz $n$-algebras. Therefore, the question of proving analogs of the above results for this type of algebras naturally arises. In this article, we prove the analogues of the two mentioned theorems for Leibniz 3-algebras.</description>

      <title>On some relationships between the center and the derived subalgebra in Poisson (2-3)-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the classic results of group theory is the so-called Schur theorem. It states that if the central factor-group $G/\zeta(G)$ of a group $G$ is finite, then its derived subgroup $[G,G]$ is also finite. This result has numerous generalizations and modifications in group theory. At the same time, similar investigations were conducted in other algebraic structures, namely in modules, linear groups, topological groups, $n$-groups, associative algebras, Lie algebras, Lie $n$-algebras, Lie rings, Leibniz algebras. In 2021, L.A. Kurdachenko, O.O. Pypka and I.Ya. Subbotin proved an analogue of Schur theorem for Poisson algebras: if the center of the Poisson algebra $P$ has finite codimension, then $P$ includes an ideal $K$ of finite dimension such that $P/K$ is abelian. In this paper, we continue similar studies for another algebraic structure. An analogue of Schur theorem for Poisson (2-3)-algebras is proved.</description>

      <title>Symmetric bilinear forms, superalgebras and integer matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and investigate certain (unbalanced) superalgebra structures on $\text{End}_K(V)$, with $K$ a field of characteristic $0$ and $V$ a finite dimensional $K$-vector space (of dimension $n\geq 2$). These structures are induced by a choice of non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form $B$ on $V$ and a choice of non-zero base vector $w\in V$. After exploring the construction further, we apply our results to certain questions concerning integer matrix factorization and isometry of integral lattices.</description>

      <title>Products of commutators in matrix rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring and let $n\ge 2$. We discuss the question of whether every element in the matrix ring $M_n(R)$ is a product of (additive) commutators $[x,y]=xy-yx$, for $x,y\in M_n(R)$. An example showing that this does not always hold, even when $R$ is commutative, is provided. If, however, $R$ has Bass stable rank one, then under various additional conditions every element in $M_n(R)$ is a product of three commutators. Further, if $R$ is a division ring with infinite center, then every element in $M_n(R)$ is a product of two commutators. If $R$ is a field and $a\in M_n(R)$, then every element in $M_n(R)$ is a sum of elements of the form $[a,x][a,y]$ with $x,y\in M_n(R)$ if and only if the degree of the minimal polynomial of $a$ is greater than $2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the conditions for the Mal'cev-Neumann series ring {\Lambda} = R((G;{\sigma};{\tau})) to be left fusible and an SA-ring. Also, we show that: if G is a quasitotally ordered group and U a {\Sigma}-compatible semiprime ideal of R, then R((G;{\sigma};{\tau})) is a {\Sigma}(U((G; {\sigma}; {\tau})))-zip ring if and only if R is a {\Sigma}(U )-zip ring.</description>

Abstract: We construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(q_u-q_{u+1})$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a $W$-algebra associated with $\mathfrak{gl}(\sum_{s=1}^lq_s)$ and a nilpotent element of type $(1^{q_1-q_2},2^{q_2-q_3},\dots,(l-1)^{q_{l-1}-q_l},l^{q_l})$ by using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine Yangian to some cosets of non-rectangular $W$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the additive (semi)group of integers. We prove that for a finite semigroup $S$ the direct product $\mathbb{Z}\times S$ contains only countably many subdirect products (up to isomorphism) if and only if $S$ is regular. As a corollary we show that $\mathbb{Z}\times S$ has only countably many subsemigroups (up to isomorphism) if and only if $S$ is completely regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the rigid dualizing complex of the (generic) affine Hecke algebra $H_q$ attached to a reduced root system and deduce some structural properties as a consequence. For example, we show that the classical Hecke algebra $H_{q^\pm}$ as well as $H_q/q$ are, under a certain condition on the root system, Frobenius over their centers with Nakayama automorphism given by an explicit involution.</description>

      <title>The categories of corings and coalgebras over a ring are locally countably presentable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any commutative ring $R$, we show that the categories of $R$-coalgebras and cocommutative $R$-coalgebras are locally $\aleph_1$-presentable, while the categories of $R$-flat $R$-coalgebras are $\aleph_1$-accessible. Similarly, for any associative ring $R$, the category of $R$-corings is locally $\aleph_1$-presentable, while the category of $R$-$R$-bimodule flat $R$-corings is $\aleph_1$-accessible. The cardinality of the ring $R$ can be arbitrarily large. We also discuss $R$-corings with surjective counit and flat kernel. The proofs are straightforward applications of an abstract category-theoretic principle going back to Ulmer. For right or two-sided $R$-module flat $R$-corings, our cardinality estimate for the accessibility rank is not as good. A generalization to comonoid objects in accessible monoidal categories is also considered.</description>

Abstract: We follow on from the pioneering paper by the second author where he introduces the Knutson Index for the character ring of a finite group. We introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings. We study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks.</description>

      <title>The coproduct for the affine Yangian and the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with some of the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

Abstract: We prove several new versions of Hilbert's basis theorem for non-associative Ore extensions, non-associative skew Laurent polynomial rings, non-associative skew power series rings, and non-associative skew Laurent series rings. For non-associative skew Laurent polynomial rings, we show that both a left and a right version of Hilbert's basis theorem hold. For non-associative Ore extensions, we show that a right version holds, but give a counterexample to a left version; a difference that does not appear in the associative setting.</description>

      <title>On Noetherian algebras, Schur functors and Hemmer-Nakano dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Important connections in representation theory arise from resolving a finite-dimensional algebra by an endomorphism algebra of a generator-cogenerator with finite global dimension; for instance, Auslander's correspondence, classical Schur--Weyl duality and Soergel's Struktursatz. Here, the module category of the resolution and the module category of the algebra being resolved are linked via an exact functor known as Schur functor. In this paper, we investigate how to measure the quality of the connection between module categories of (projective) Noetherian algebras, $B$, and module categories of endomorphism algebras of generators-relative cogenerators over $B$ which are split quasi-hereditary Noetherian algebras. In particular, we are interested in finding, if it exists, the highest degree $n$ so that the endomorphism algebra of a generator-cogenerator provides an $n$-faithful cover, in the sense of Rouquier, of $B$. The degree $n$ is known as Hemmer-Nakano dimension of the standard modules. We prove that the Hemmer-Nakano dimension of standard modules with respect to a Schur functor from a split highest weight category over a field to the module category of a finite-dimensional algebra $B$ is bounded above by the number of non-isomorphic simple modules of $B$. We establish methods how to reduce computations of Hemmer-Nakano dimensions in the integral setup to computations of Hemmer-Nakano dimensions over finite-dimensional algebras. This theory allows us to derive results for Schur algebras and the BGG category O in the integral setup from the finite-dimensional case using relative dominant dimension. We exhibit several structural properties of deformations of the blocks of the BGG category O establishing an integral version of Soergel's Struktursatz. We show that deformations of the combinatorial Soergel's functor have better homological properties than the classical one.</description>

      <title>On split quasi-hereditary covers and Ringel duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop two new homological invariants called relative dominant dimension with respect to a module and relative codominant dimension with respect to a module. These are used to establish precise connections between Ringel duality, split quasi-hereditary covers and double centraliser properties.
  These homological invariants are studied over Noetherian algebras which are finitely generated and projective as a module over the ground ring and they are shown to behave nicely under change of rings techniques. It turns out that relative codominant dimension with respect to a summand of a characteristic tilting module is a useful tool to construct quasi-hereditary covers of Noetherian algebras and measure their quality. In particular, this homological invariant is used to construct split quasi-hereditary covers of quotients of Iwahori-Hecke algebras using Ringel duality of $q$-Schur algebras. Combining techniques of cover theory with relative dominant dimension theory we obtain a new proof for Ringel self-duality of the blocks of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category $\mathcal{O}$.</description>
