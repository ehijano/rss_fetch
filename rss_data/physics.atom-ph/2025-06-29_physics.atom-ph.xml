      <title>On efficiency of double ionization of a three-electron atom in moderate laser field intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study double ionization in a one-dimensional model of a three-electron atom exposed to strong short laser fields. The corresponding ab initio simulations reveal a characteristic ``knee'' in the ionization yield at lower field intensities than in comparable two-electron systems. To understand the origin of this shift, a quantitative semi-analytic model for double ionization of a three-electron atom has been created. In this model, ionization is treated as a combination of different scenarios and channels. Each channel is simulated with either Quantitative Rescattering Theory (QRS) or two-electron ab initio model. Analysis of the semi-analytical results indicates that the shifted part of the ``knee'' is dominated by a recollision-excitation channel in which the rescattering electron initially escapes the parent atom from an inner orbital. This counterintuitive phenomenon is then discussed and explained.</description>

      <title>Second-order corrections of orders $m\alpha^6$ and $m\alpha^6(m/M)$ to the spin-averaged energy in the HD$^+$ and H$_2^+$ ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic second-order corrections at orders $m\alpha^6$ and $m\alpha^6(m/M)$ in hydrogen molecular ions are calculated. Convergence of numerical results is studied, which allows estimating the relative numerical uncertainty to be less then $10^{-5}$. This accuracy is sufficient to enable future improvement of theoretical predictions beyond the 1 ppt (part-per-trillion) precision level for the ro-vibrational transition frequencies.</description>

      <title>Investigation of three-body F\"orster resonance for various spatial configurations of the three interacting Rubidium Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms captured in optical traps and laser-excited into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In Ref. [P. Cheinet et al., Quantum Electronics 50(3), 213 (2020)], we proposed and analyzed a new type of three-body F\"orster resonance ${\rm 3}\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2}$ that can be realized with Rb Rydberg atoms for an arbitrary principal quantum number $n$. Its peculiarity is that the third atom goes into a state with a total angular moment $J=1/2$, which has no Stark structure, so two-body F\"orster resonances are completely absent. In the present work, an extended theoretical study of this three-body F\"orster resonance is performed for various spatial configurations of three interacting Rb Rydberg atoms and conditions for their experimental implementation are determined. It was found that one of the resonances has a weak dependence of the resonant electric field on the distance between atoms and is therefore most suitable for performing experiments to observe coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implement three-qubit quantum gates based on them.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of a single trapped ion in a high density media: a stochastic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Langevin equation, a stochastic formulation is implemented to describe the dynamics of a trapped ion in a bath of ultracold atoms, including an excess of micromotion. The ion dynamics is described following a hybrid analytical-numerical approach in which the ion is treated as a classical impurity in a thermal bath. As a result, the ion energy's time evolution and distribution are derived from studying the sympathetic cooling process. Furthermore, the ion dynamics under different stochastic noise terms is also considered to gain information on the bath properties' role in the system's energy transfer processes. Finally, the results obtained from this formulation are contrasted with those obtained with a more traditional Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Complete insensitivity to ab initio data -- A new perspective on modeling collision-induced absorption of noble gas atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate how the accuracy of CIA spectra depends on the quality of the ab initio data used. We evaluate quantitatively the impact of different quantum chemical methods and basis sets on spectral features, finding that even the lowest-level calculations are accurate to approximately 10 % at room temperature, and better at higher temperatures. This study also reveals a previously unreported double-peak structure for the He-Ne complex, which cannot be described by simple but commonly used single-exponential models for the short-range dipole. Our analysis shows that the range of internuclear distances relevant for CIA spectra varies with temperature, with short-range interactions becoming increasingly important at high temperatures. The long-range van der Waals induced dipoles never contribute. These findings provide new insights into the temperature-dependent behavior of CIA spectra and emphasize the importance of accurate modeling of short-range interactions for reliable astronomical modeling.</description>

      <title>Atomic Dirac energy-level dynamics and redshift in the 4xU(1) gravity gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational interaction unavoidably influences atoms and their electromagnetic radiation field in strong gravitational fields. Theoretical description of such effects using the curved metric of general relativity is limited due to the classical nature of the metric and the assumption of the local inertial frame, where gravitational interaction is absent. Here we apply unified gravity extension of the Standard Model [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] to solve the Dirac equation for hydrogen-like atoms in the 4xU(1) gravity gauge field, which appears alongside all other quantum fields. We show that the gravity gauge field shifts the atomic Dirac energy levels by an amount that agrees with the experimentally observable gravitational redshift. Our result for the redshift follows directly from quantum field theory and is strictly independent of the metric-based explanation of general relativity. Furthermore, we present how gravitational potential gradient breaks the symmetry of the electric potential of the atomic nucleus, thus leading to splitting of otherwise degenerate spectral lines in strong gravitational fields. Enabling detailed spectral line analysis, our work opens novel possibilities for future investigations of quantum photonics phenomena in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in Gaussian beams using a cylindrical lens pair with tunable focal lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correcting astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams is critical for improving performance in many applications like microscopy, atomic physics, quantum information processing, and advanced manufacturing. Passive correction methods based on cylindrical lens telescopes require choosing lenses with precise focal lengths, effectively limiting the range of tunability when using standard catalog optics. Active solutions based on diffractive optical elements can achieve superior performance, but they are bulky, expensive, and suffer from finite diffraction efficiency and added complexity. Here, we introduce a simple method to convert astigmatic elliptical beams into circular Gaussian beams without astigmatism. Our method comprises three cylindrical lenses. The first lens focuses the beam along its major axis to create a plane where the intensity profile is radially symmetric. The second and third lenses are placed one behind the other in that plane at a relative angle, acting as a biaxial lens pair with tunable focal lengths. By adjusting the relative angle of the lenses, the two separate beam waists of the astigmatic beam can be overlapped, resulting in a circular Gaussian beam without astigmatism. We theoretically validate our method, numerically quantify its robustness to experimental imperfections, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to circularize the output beam of a commercial laser source. Our method corrects astigmatism and ellipticity in laser beams without requiring precise focal length matching, offering greater flexibility than other passive solutions and greater cost-effectiveness than active methods. Its simple and compact design makes it well suited for integration into both tabletop optical setups and industrial systems.</description>

Abstract: The finite operators are derived for the nonrecoil (leading order in the $(m/M)$ expansion) relativistic corrections in hydrogen-like atoms and ions at orders $m\alpha^6$ in the two- and three-body formalism beyond the adiabatic approximation. Singular operators that appear in the derivation are analysed, and various regularization methods are discussed.</description>

      <title>IKEBANA: A Neural-Network approach for the K-shell ionization by electron impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fully connected neural network was trained to model the K-shell ionization cross sections based on two input features: the atomic number and the incoming electron overvoltage. The training utilized a recent, updated compilation of experimental data, covering elements from H to U, and incident electron energies ranging from the threshold to relativistic values. The neural network demonstrated excellent predictive performance, compared with the experimental data, when available, and with full theoretical predictions. The developed model is provided in the ikebana code, which is openly available and requires only the user-selected atomic number and electron energy range as inputs.</description>

      <title>Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring in the absence of rotation. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of Berry connection on attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in gapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to pristine graphene, whose fishbone-shaped spectra oscillate at twice the pump laser frequency, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits an additional component oscillating at the pump laser frequency, induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into these interesting results, we employ a simplified model to derive an analytical expression for the spectral component stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, revealing that the intensity of the fundamental-frequency spectral component depends not only on the Berry connection but also on the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the van Hove singularities. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.</description>
