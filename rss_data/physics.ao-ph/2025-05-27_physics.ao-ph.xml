      <title>Advancing global sea ice prediction capabilities using a fully-coupled climate model with integrated machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We showcase a hybrid modeling framework which embeds machine learning (ML) inference into the GFDL SPEAR climate model, for online sea ice bias correction during a set of global fully-coupled 1-year retrospective forecasts. We compare two hybrid versions of SPEAR to understand the importance of exposing ML models to coupled ice-atmosphere-ocean feedbacks before implementation into fully-coupled simulations: Hybrid_CPL (with feedbacks) and Hybrid_IO (without feedbacks). Relative to SPEAR, Hybrid_CPL systematically reduces seasonal forecast errors in the Arctic and significantly reduces Antarctic errors for target months May-December, with &gt;2x error reduction in 4-6-month lead forecasts of Antarctic winter sea ice extent. Meanwhile, Hybrid_IO suffers from out-of-sample behavior which can trigger a chain of Southern Ocean feedbacks, leading to ice-free Antarctic summers. Our results demonstrate that ML can significantly improve numerical sea ice prediction capabilities and that exposing ML models to coupled ice-atmosphere-ocean processes is essential for generalization in fully-coupled simulations.</description>

      <title>Waves in ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean surface waves can propagate long distances through regions containing floating ice covers. The impacts ocean waves have on the ice covers are of interest in the climate change era, as the polar regions experience pressure from rising temperatures. This chapter provides a review of observations and theoretical models for ocean wave propagation through the marginal ice zone, landfast ice and ice shelves. It traces the historical evolution of the field, from seminal work in the 1970s-80s up to recent research advances. Key research questions are identified for each of the three ice covers, and commonalities between them are highlighted. The chapter concludes with perspectives and outlooks on the field of waves in ice, in the context of the dramatic changes currently occurring to the world's sea ice and ice shelves.</description>

      <title>A validated coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and spectral wind-wave model for the western north Atlantic Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind-wave and ocean current interactions affect critical coastal and oceanic processes, yet modeling these interactions presents significant challenges. The western North Atlantic Ocean provides an ideal test environment for coupled hydrodynamics and wind wave models, thanks to its energetic surface currents such as the Gulf Stream. This study evaluates a high-resolution coupled SCHISM WWM III model, utilizing NOAA's 'STOFS-3D-Atlantic' computational mesh, while incorporating three-dimensional baroclinic dynamics to account for density stratification effects. We evaluate the model's calculated water level and tidal predictions against NOAA tide gauge measurements during December 2016. The coupled model demonstrates robust skills in reproducing tidal constituents, non-tidal components, and total water level predictions along the U.S. East and Gulf of Mexico Coasts. In addition, we systematically evaluate three wave physics parameterizations (Ardhuin, Makin and Stam, and Cycle Three) in the spectral wave model to quantify their effects on the modeled wave characteristics. This validated modeling framework enhances our ability to understand and predict complex coastal and oceanic processes, offering significant applications for coastal management, maritime operations, and climate adaptation planning throughout the western North Atlantic region.</description>

      <title>Vertical Profile Corrected Satellite NH3 Retrievals Enable Accurate Agricultural Emission Characterization in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia (NH3) emissions significantly contribute to atmospheric pollution, yet discrepancies exist between bottom-up inventories and satellite-constrained top-down estimates, with the latter typically one-third higher. This study quantifies how assumptions about NH3 vertical distribution in satellite retrievals contribute to this gap. By implementing spatially and temporally resolved vertical profiles from the Community Multiscale Air Quality model to replace steep gradients in Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) retrievals, we reduced satellite-model column discrepancies from 71% to 18%. We subsequently constrained NH3 emissions across China using a hybrid inversion framework combining iterative mass balance and four-dimensional variational methods. Our posterior emissions showed agreement with the a priori inventory (7.9% lower), suggesting that discrepancies between inventory approaches were amplified by overestimation of near-surface NH3 in baseline satellite retrievals, potentially causing a 43% overestimation of growing season emissions. Evaluation against ground-based measurements confirmed improved model performance, with normalized root-mean-square error reductions of 1-27% across six months. These findings demonstrate that accurate representation of vertical profiles in satellite retrievals is critical for robust NH3 emission estimates and can reconcile the long-standing discrepancy between bottom-up and top-down approaches. Our hybrid inversion methodology, leveraging profile-corrected satellite data, reveals that China's NH3 emissions exhibit greater spatial concentration than previously recognized, reflecting agricultural intensification. This advancement enables timely and accurate characterization of rapidly changing agricultural emission patterns, critical for implementing effective nitrogen pollution control measures.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian calibration and uncertainty quantification of RANS turbulence model parameters for stratified atmospheric boundary layer flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In operational weather models, the effects of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) on the resolved flow are modeled using turbulence parameterizations. These parameterizations typically use a predetermined set of model parameters that are tuned to limited data from canonical flows. Using these fixed parameters results in deterministic predictions that neglect uncertainty in the unresolved turbulence processes. In this study, we perform a machine learning-accelerated Bayesian inversion of a single-column model of the ABL. This approach is used to calibrate and quantify uncertainty in model parameters of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models. Following verification of the uncertainty quantification methodology, we learn the parameters and their uncertainties in two different turbulence models conditioned on scale-resolving large-eddy simulation data over a range of ABL stabilities. We show how Bayesian inversion of a numerical model improves flow predictions by investigating the underlying mean momentum budgets. Further, we show that uncertainty quantification based on neutral surface layer data recovers the relationships between parameters derived from theoretical modeling, but that learning the parameters based on stable ABL data or data from outside the surface layer can lead to different relationships than neutral surface layer theory. Systematic uncertainty reduction methods reveal that (1) sampling wind speed up to the ABL height can reduce uncertainty in key model parameters by up to 84%, and (2) assimilating fluid flow quantities beyond first-order moment statistics can further reduce uncertainty in ways that wind speed assimilation alone cannot achieve. The parameters learned using Bayesian uncertainty quantification generally yield lower error than standard deterministic parameters in out-of-sample tests and provide uncertainty intervals on predictions.</description>
