      <title>Alpha decay law of excited nuclei and its role in stellar decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$ decay is one of the prominent decay modes in the nucleosynthesis of heavy and super-heavy elements synthesized at temperatures of the order of Giga Kelvin. To facilitate the investigation of the role played by the $\alpha$ decay half-lives of thermally excited nuclei in nucleosynthesis calculations, an empirical formula based on a model for the $\alpha$ decay of nuclei in their ground and excited states to daughter nuclei in their ground or excited states is presented. Constants appearing in the analytical expression for the $\alpha$ decay half-life obtained within the model are treated as adjustable parameters and fitted to experimental data on 342 $\alpha$ decays in the range of 82 $\le Z_p \le$ 94, to obtain an excitation energy-dependent decay law. Under the assumption that thermal equilibrium has been reached between nuclear states, temperature ($T$)-dependent half-lives, $t_{1/2}(T)$, for several of the experimentally studied $\alpha$ emitters with 65 $\le Z_p \le$ 94 are presented using available data on the half-lives of excited nuclei. Though the general trend is a decrease in $t_{1/2}(T)$ at elevated temperatures, exceptional cases with increased half-lives are found in the case of some isomeric states. A list of such isomers provided in this work motivates future work involving considerations of their thermal equilibration and role in shaping kilonova light curves.</description>

      <title>Phase Stability in the 3-Dimensional Open-source Code for the Chiral mean-field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore independently for the first time three chemical potentials (baryon $\mu_B$, charged $\mu_Q$, and strange $\mu_S$) in the Chiral mean-field (CMF) model. We designed and implemented \texttt{CMF++}, a new version of the CMF model rewritten in \texttt{C++} that is optimized, modular, and well-documented. \texttt{CMF++} has been integrated into the MUSES Calculation Engine as a free and open source software module. The runtime improved in more than 4 orders of magnitude across all 3 chemical potentials, when compared to the legacy code. Here we focus on the zero temperature case and study stable, as well as metastable and unstable, vacuum, hadronic, and quark phases, showing how phase boundaries vary with the different chemical potentials. Due to the significant numerical improvements in \texttt{CMF++}, we can calculate for the first time high-order susceptibilities within the CMF framework to study the properties of the quark deconfinement phase transition. We found phases of matter that include a light hadronic phase, strangeness-dominated hadronic phase, and quark deconfinement within our $\mu_B$, $\mu_S$, $\mu_Q$ phase space. The phase transitions are of first, second (quantum critical point), and third order between these phases and we even identified a tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin and its effects in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron skin is an exotic phenomena in unstable nuclei. The various effects in nuclear reactions caused by the neutron skin and also its relation with the properties of nuclear structure are reviewed in this article. Based on numerous studies with theoretical models, strong correlations have been found between the neutron skin thickness and neutron removal cross section, neutron/proton yield ratio, t/\ch{^3He} yield ratio, neutron-proton momentum difference, isoscaling parameter, photon production, reaction cross sections for neutron induced reactions, charge-changing cross sections difference of mirror nuclei, astrophysical $S$-factor, and other quantities in nuclear reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei. Moreover, the relationships between neutron skin thickness and some properties of nuclear structure, such as $\alpha$-cluster formation, $\alpha$ decay, nuclear surface, nuclear temperature, and proton radii difference of mirror nuclei, have also been investigated. It also has been shown that the neutron skin plays a crucial role in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Experimentally, an unstable nucleus with neutron skin can be generated by radioactive nuclear beam facilities, and the thickness of neutron skin could be extracted by measuring the sensitive probes, which further helps giving stringent constraints on the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter and properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Resummed spin hydrodynamics from quantum kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the equations of dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics based on quantum kinetic theory are derived. Employing the inverse-Reynolds dominance (IReD) approach, a resummation scheme based on a power counting in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers is constructed, leading to hydrodynamic equations that are accurate to second order. It is found that the spin dynamics can be characterized by eleven equations: six of them describe the evolution of the components of the spin potential, while the remaining five provide the equation of motion of a dissipative irreducible rank-two tensor. For a simple truncation, the first- and second-order transport coefficients are computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Green's functions approach for homogeneous nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous nuclear matter is investigated using the \textit{ab initio} Self-consistent Green's function (SCGF) approach with nuclear interactions based on chiral effective field theory. The employed method, which combines the state-of-the-art algebraic diagrammatic construction approximation at third order with Gorkov correlations, is capable of computing both the equation of state (EOS) and single-particle properties of nuclear matter. The EOS calculated with our approach and coupled-cluster theory are shown to agree very well. The one-nucleon spectral functions and the momentum distributions are discussed to gain insights into the dynamics of the interacting nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Baryon stopping and charge deposition in heavy-ion collisions due to gluon saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations are crucial for the phenomenological extraction and separation of various generalized parton distributions. We provide a new choice of frame and corresponding formalism to describe the azimuthal distributions, based on the separation of physics occurring at different momentum scales. We demonstrate that this new description is not only well-suited for experimental analysis, but also advantageous in separating contributions from different subprocesses to the same physical cross section.</description>

      <title>Investigations on the equation of state of neutron star matter with density-dependent relativistic mean-field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compact object with a mass of $2.50-2.67~M_\odot$ observed by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations in GW190814, as well as the recent report of a light compact object with a mass and radius of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_{\odot}$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, have posed a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. In the inner core region of the neutron star, the strangeness degrees of freedom, such as the hyperons, can be present, which is also named as a hyperonic star. In this work, the neutron star consisting of nucleons and leptons, and the hyperonic star including the hyperons will be studied in the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) model. Some popular DDRMF parameterizations will be adopted to investigate the properties of nuclear matter and the mass, radius, tidal deformability, and other properties of neutron star and hyperonic stars. We find that the maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX, DD-MEX1, DD-MEX2, DD-MEXY and DD-LZ1 sets can be around $2.5-2.6~M_\odot$ with quite stiff equations of state (EOSs) generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities. Moreover, by investigating the influence of the crust EOS and core EOS on the neutron stars, we find that the observational data from HESS J1731-347 suggest the requirement of a crust EOS with a higher $L$ parameter and a core EOS with a lower $L$ parameter, and the $M-R$ relations from the constructed EOSs can also be consistent with the observables of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451 from NICER and the GW170817 event. With the inclusion of hyperons, the hyperonic star matter becomes softer compared to the neutron star matter. But the massive hyperonic star can also be obtained with DDRMF parameter sets if the vector coupling constants are strong.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Effects of Cluster Transfer-Induced Breakups on $^{12}$C Fragmentation in Hadron Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of standard Geant4 PhysicsLists to address the fragmentation of $^{12}$C$-^{12}$C was assessed through a comparative analysis with experimental cross sections reported by Divay et al. and Dudouet et al. The standard PhysicsLists were found to be inadequate in explaining the fragmentation systematics. To address this limitation, the breakup component of fragmentation was systematically integrated into the standard PhysicsList, which successfully replicated the differential and double differential cross sections for $\alpha$ production. This breakup component was modeled using fresco CDCC-CRC calculations. This novel physics process was then incorporated into the Geant4 framework, facilitating the calculation of dose distributions in water and tissue. The application of this method demonstrated a precise reproduction of the dose deposited at the Bragg peak region, corroborating the experimental data from Liedner et al., thereby enhancing the accurate visibility of dose tailing.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic linear waves and breakdown of the momentum expansion in spin magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate spin magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by including the magnetic-flux and total angular momentum conservation laws in the hydrodynamic framework. To specify the local angular momentum conservation, we choose the totally antisymmetric spin current. The entropy-current analysis allows for ten dissipative first-order transport coefficients including anisotropic spin relaxation rates and the conversion rate between a vorticity (shear) to a symmetric stress (antisymmetric torque). By employing the linear-mode analysis, we solve the first-order spin MHD equations to determine the dispersion relations with the complete information of anisotropy retained. Our analytic solutions indicate that the small-momentum expansion is spoiled by blow up of the higher-order terms when the angle between the momentum and the magnetic field approaches the right angle. This also reveals the existence of another expansion parameter, and, in light of it, we provide solutions in an alternative series expression beyond the critical angle. We confirm that these two series expansions work well in the appropriate angle ranges as compared with numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing analysis of the BESIII Collaboration on the single-tagged $e^+e^-\to e^+e^- \eta \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction, we present a phenomenological study of the diphoton fusion to $\eta \pi^+ \pi^-$, focusing on the production mechanism of the $f_1(1285)$ resonance. Contributions from the $f_1(1285)\to a_0(980)^\pm\, \pi^\mp$ and $f_1(1285)\to \sigma/f_0(500)\, \eta$ channels are included without introducing free parameters within an effective Lagrangian approach. Assuming the destructive interference between the amplitudes, we predict the invariant mass distributions, angular distributions, and total cross sections of the $\gamma^*\gamma \to \eta\pi^+\pi^-$ process, which will be tested by the forthcoming BESIII measurements.</description>

      <title>$^{61}$Cr as a Doorway to the N = 40 Island of Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports on the measurement of the ground-state spin and nuclear magnetic dipole moment of $^{61}$Cr. The radioactive ion beam was produced at the CERN-ISOLDE facility and was probed using high-resolution resonance ionization laser spectroscopy with the CRIS apparatus. The present ground-state spin measurement $I = \frac{1}{2}$, differing from the previously adopted $I =(\frac{5}{2})$, has significant consequences on the interpretation of existing beta decay data and nuclear structure in the region. The structure and shape of $^{61}$Cr is interpreted with state-of-the-art Large-Scale Shell Model and Discrete-Non-Orthogonal Shell Model calculations. From the measured magnetic dipole moment $\mu(^{61}$Cr$)=+0.539(7)~\mu_N$ and the theoretical findings, its configuration is understood to be driven by 2 particle - 2 hole neutron excitations with an unpaired $1p_{1/2}$ neutron. This establishes the western border of the $N=40$ Island Of Inversion (IoI), characterized by 4 particle - 4 hole neutron components. We discuss the shape evolution along the Cr isotopic chain as a quantum phase transition at the entrance of the $N=40$ IoI.</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparencies with a two-step process of the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear transparency in pion-induced nuclear reactions has been investigated based on Glauber multiple scattering theory considering a two-step process within the framework of vector meson dominance (VMD). In the present context, the application of the quantum diffusion model (QDM) to the Glauber theory plays a role in explaining the dependence of the transparency on the four-momentum transfer squared $Q^2$. The short-range correlation (SRC) considered further gives the contribution to the magnitude of the transparency by a constant amount independent of the $Q^2$ variation, and the results from the QDM and SRC overestimate the experimental data. The inclusion of the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section, $\sigma_{\rho N}=3 $ mb has the effect of reducing the transparency and thus leads to a good agreement with the experimental data on the reaction $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle potentials from light-like Wilson lines in quark-gluon plasmas: a generalized relation of in-medium splitting rates to jet-quenching parameters $\hat q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful historical insight about the theory of in-medium showering in QCD backgrounds was that splitting rates can be related to a parameter $\hat q$ that characterizes the rate of transverse-momentum kicks to a high-energy particle from the medium. Another powerful insight was that $\hat q$ can be defined (with caveats) even when the medium is strongly coupled, using long, narrow Wilson loops whose two long edges are light-like Wilson lines. The medium effects for the original calculations of in-medium splitting rates can be formulated in terms of 3-body imaginary-valued `potentials' that are defined with three long, light-like Wilson lines. Corrections due to overlap of two consecutive splittings can be calculated using similarly defined 4-body potentials. I give a simple argument for how such $N$-body potentials can be determined in the appropriate limit just from knowledge of the values of $\hat q$ for different color representations. For $N &gt; 3$, the $N$-body potentials have non-trivial color structure, which will complicate calculations of overlap corrections outside of the large-$N_c$ or soft bremsstrahlung limits.</description>

Abstract: Inside a medium, showers originating from a very high-energy particle may develop via medium-induced splitting processes such as hard bremsstrahlung or pair production. During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes overlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently. Some of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium parameter known as $\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying assumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\hat q$, the leftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic large-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at comparable values of $N\alpha$. Those works did not quite make for apples-to-apples comparisons: the gluon shower work investigated energy deposition from a gluon-initiated shower, whereas the QED work investigated charge-deposition from an electron-initiated shower. As a first step to tighten up the comparison, this paper investigates energy deposition in the QED case. Along the way, we develop a framework that should be useful in the future to explore whether the very small effect of overlapping splitting in purely gluonic showers is an artifact of having ignored quarks.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>

Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called dSC phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge separation for paired Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions at finite density coupled to a complex pairing field assumed to obey scalar field theory with quartic self-repulsion. The bulk of our work develops the mathematics that elucidates the propagation of fermionic excitations in such systems as independent spin (boosts) and charge (fermion number) degrees of freedom. A necessary ingredient is the presence of broken $U(1)$ symmetry in the pairing field and decoupling of its density and phase. In the fermion sector, these elements give rise to an emergent spin-dependent gauge coupling which binds in-vacuum spin and charge into elementary fermions, while driving proliferation of unbound spin and charge for finite condensation in the pairing field. Notably, the onset of spin-charge separation is signaled by $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetry breaking and decoupling of spin components under Lorentz transformations. Our investigation concludes with two theorems that identify generic features of spin-charge separation in such systems.</description>
