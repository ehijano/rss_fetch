      <title>Towards fully predictive gyrokinetic full-f simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak \`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Loading non-Maxwellian Velocity Distributions in Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical procedures for generating non-Maxwellian velocity distributions in particle simulations are presented. First, Monte Carlo methods for an $(r,q)$ distribution that generalizes flattop and kappa distributions are discussed. Then, two rejection methods for the regularized kappa distribution are presented, followed by a comparison in the $\kappa$ space. A simple recipe is proposed for the subtracted kappa distribution. Properties and numerical recipes for the ring and shell distributions with a finite Gaussian width are discussed. The ring and shell Maxwellians are further introduced as alternatives to the ring and shell distributions. Finally, the super-Gaussian and the filled-shell distributions are presented.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Formulation of the Snowplow Model and Operating Point for Z pinch Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We write down the lagrangian for the snowplow model of the Z pinch system. Then, we develop the Euler-Lagrange equations to find out the corresponding equations of motion. Next, we set a criterion for quantitatively estimating the performance of Z pinch devices. Finally, we apply this criterion to a specific Z pinch system.</description>

      <title>Comparison of MHD and gyrokinetic simulations of linear instabilities at the q = 1 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of core instabilities in tokamak plasmas is essential to understand the underlying physical mechanisms and their impact on plasma confinement. The ideal stability of the internal kink mode and the m = 1 collisionless tearing mode are analyzed numerically both with gyrokinetic and MHD codes. We compare the different models implemented in the codes and show that the gyrokinetic equations without collisions inherently contain the ideal MHD limit. The simulation results show that the stability of the internal kink mode strongly depends on the choice of several setup parameters like the inclusion of parallel magnetic field fluctuations, the tokamak aspect ratio, the drift- or gyrokinetic treatment of the ions and the electron mass. Furthermore, we demonstrate the stabilization of the instabilities by diamagnetic effects. Our results indicate that gyrokinetic and MHD models can be reconciled in the description of the internal kink mode by careful consideration of the simulation setup and model assumptions, but instabilities like the collisionless tearing mode require a more advanced treatment beyond MHD.</description>

      <title>On three dimensional steady super-Alfv\'{e}nic magnetohydrodynamics shocks with aligned fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled motion between the hydrodynamic flow and magnetic field introduces significant complexity into the structure of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. A key factor contributing to this complexity is the presence of Alfv\'en waves, which critically influences the character of the flow and makes the problem considerably more challenging. Within the framework where the magnetic field is everywhere parallel to the flow velocity, we give an effective decomposition of the steady MHD equations in terms of the deformation tensor and the modified vorticity, where the modification in the vorticity is to record the effect of the Lorentz force on the velocity field. The existence and structural stability of the super-Alfv\'{e}nic cylindrical transonic shock solutions for the steady MHD equations are established under three-dimensional perturbations of the incoming flow and the exit total pressure (kinetic plus magnetic).</description>

      <title>Polar Filaments Capture High Latitude Solar Poloidal Field Interactions and can Foretell the Future Sunspot Cycle Amplitude before Polar Field Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analytical Model of the Dynamic Z-Pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical 1D axisymmetric model describing the evolution of the dynamic z-pinch. This model is capable of predicting the trajectories of the imploding sheath's magnetic piston and preceding shock front, along with the velocity, pressure, density, and magnetic field profiles, for any time-dependent current, spatially-varying initial density profile, and weak initial axial field. The implosion is divided into stages, with each stage described by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations derived from the ideal MHD equations. Comparison with experimental data from the COBRA pulsed-power facility is quite promising and implies this model could prove useful in designing and analyzing future pulsed-power experiments.</description>
