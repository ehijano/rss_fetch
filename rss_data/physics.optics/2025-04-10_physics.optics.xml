      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>

      <title>Wavefront shaping enables high-power multimode fiber amplifier with output control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades there have been tremendous advances in high-power fiber lasers, which have provided a powerful tool for science, engineering and defense. A major roadblock for further power scaling of single-frequency fiber laser amplifiers is stimulated Brillouin scattering. Intense efforts were devoted to mitigate this nonlinear process, but mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers which have good beam quality. Here we explore a highly multimode fiber amplifier, where stimulated Brillouin scattering is greatly suppressed due to reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and broadening of Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. To control the output beam profile, we apply spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier to focus the output beam to a diffraction-limited spot outside the fiber facet. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth which ensures high coherence. Optical wavefront shaping enables coherent control of multimode laser amplification, with potential applications in coherent beam combining, large-scale interferometry and directed energy delivery.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Circuit Modeling of a Lumped-element Loaded Metasurface under Arbitrary Incidence and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a key technology for next-generation communication, offering real-time and dynamic control over electromagnetic wave characteristics. The scattering of an RIS unit cell can be effectively modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM) of a lumped RLC-loaded metasurface. However, existing ECMs, particularly those with square patches, often fail to generalize beyond specific configurations or integrate lumped elements, limiting their practical applicability to single polarization or normal incidence. In this work, we propose a simple yet robust ECM that accurately predicts the spectral response while maintaining adaptability across varying design parameters, including polarization, arbitrary angles of incidence, and physical dimensions of lumped elements. Our approach is built incrementally, starting from a 1x1 unit cell as the fundamental structure and extending to 2x1 and 2x2 cell configurations. The 2x2 cell structure allows for multifunctionality and reconfigurability in dual independent polarizations. These capabilities facilitate the realization of vector holographic metasurfaces. Validation with full-wave simulations demonstrates strong agreement, highlighting the efficiency and robustness of our model. This work lays the foundation for simplified and effective RIS modeling and optimization in advanced communication systems.</description>

      <title>Isolator-Free Laser Operation Enabled by Chip-Scale Reflections in Zero-Process-Change SOI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isolation-free operation of photonic integrated circuits enables dense integration, reducing packaging costs and complexity. Most isolator replacements require a change in the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) foundry process and suffer from large insertion loss. Most solutions did not integrate the laser, leaving the verification incomplete, and measurements with modulated reflections have also been missing. In this work, we present, for the first time, a zero-process-change silicon photonic (SiP) circuit that, when paired with an integrated distributed-feedback laser (DFB), enhances the DFB's immunity to continuous-wave and modulated parasitic reflections from multiple reflectors. The circuit generates intentional, controlled self-injection to stabilize laser dynamics and maintain operation. The SiP circuit is complemented by an electro-optic feedback loop that dynamically adjusts the self-injection to preserve laser stability. The proposed circuit introduces an insertion loss of 1.5 dB and enables the DFB laser to tolerate back reflections as large as -7 dB and -12 dB from on-chip and off-chip reflectors, respectively. The DFB is hybrid integrated with the SiP chip using a photonic wire bond (PWB). The isolator-free operation of the integrated laser in a high-speed optical link has been demonstrated, highlighting its potential for data communication applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Light Generation in Ultraviolet-A Band on Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate nano photonics provides highly efficient nonlinear optics processes covering a broad spectrum from ultraviolet to mid-infrared, yet studies thus far have concentrated in the near-infrared regime. Here we demonstrate light generation in the Ultraviolet-A band in a periodic poled waveguide via second harmonic generation. The internal efficiency reaches 1797 $\% W^{-1}/cm^{-2}$, marking a 9.1-times improvement over the state of art, thanks to better mode overlap and poling. Our technique can find applications in atomic clocks, frequency comb generation, sensing, and visible entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced cooling via self-Kerr nonlinearity in cavity-magnomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling massive oscillators to quantum ground state is a key step for their precise control and quantum application. Recent work found that the center-of-mass motion of a levitated magnetic sphere can be cooled via magnon-cavity coupling. In this work, we demonstrate that a enhanced cooling can be realized by exploiting self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnon mode, observed in a ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere. By means of proper pump driving, the self-Kerr nonlinearity is mapped into degenerate magnon squeezing, leading to considerable enhancement of cooling via optimizing system parameters. Moreover, this Kerr nonlinear effect also brings enhanced cooling in the sideband-unresolved regime where the mechanical frequency is smaller than the cavity decay rate. These results provide new way to quantum technologies in terms of storage schemes and ultrasensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Reverberant Shear Waves for Assessing Tissue Dispersion in Optical Coherence Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity. Accurate characterization of viscoelastic properties requires estimating shear wave speed (SWS) across multiple frequencies, as dispersion induces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This study introduces a novel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance viscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave dynamics over multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and validation of MFR-OCE through simulations and experiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine cornea, and ex vivo bovine liver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS with errors below 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that MFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates, with differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion coefficients extracted from biological tissues and phantoms align with the theoretical viscoelastic power law model. The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low viscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power law fit of SWS, while the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic behavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant frequency dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings demonstrate that MFR-OCE enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue mechanics and holds the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>End-to-end design framework for compressed on-chip pixel-wise spectro-polarimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern detector manufacturing allows spectral and polarimetric filters to be directly integrated on top of separate detector pixels. This enables the creation of CubeSat-sized spectro-polarimetric instruments that are not much larger than the detector and a lens. Redundancy inherent to the observed scene, offers the opportunity for sparse sampling in the form of not scanning all filters at every location. However, when there are fewer pushbroom steps than filters, data are missing in the resulting data cube. The missing, largely redundant data can be filled in with interpolation methods, often called demosaicers. The choice of filters and their precise layout influences the performance of the instrument after the demosaicing process. In these proceedings we describe a part of a design toolbox for both the filter layout and the optimum parameters for the reconstruction to a full spectro-polarimetric data cube. The design tool is based on training a (neural) network and jointly updating the values of the filters and demosaicer. We optimized a filter layout by training on spectro-polarimetric remote observations of the Earth acquired by SPEX airborne. This optimised filter layout could reconstruct a validation scene from five overlapping snapshots (pushbroom steps), which would take 109 pushbroom steps when measuring with a classical layout and no reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Higher-order exceptional points in composite non-Hermitan systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a composite quantum system described by the tensor product of multiple systems each with a leading-order exceptional point (a non-Hermitian degeneracy at which not only eigenvalues but also eigenstates coalesce) exhibits a single leading-order exceptional point, whose order surpasses the order of any constituent exceptional point. The formation of such higher-order exceptional points does not require coupling among the subsystems. We determine explicitly the order and the spectral response strength of this exceptional point. Moreover, we observe that the energy eigenstates that do not merge are entangled. Finally, we demonstrate that general initial states disentangle during time evolution due to the presence of the higher-order exceptional point of the composite system.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics of GHz acoustic waves in chipscale phononic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phononic integrated circuits, which manipulate GHz-frequency acoustic fields in {\mu}m-scale waveguides, provide new degrees of freedom for routing and manipulation of microwaves in deeply sub-wavelength geometries with associated implications for chipscale sensing and signal processing. The combination of low propagation loss, long interaction lengths and slow speed of sound put together with the large measurement bandwidths and high frequency resolution available from modern vector network analyzers (VNA) makes it feasible to visualize the temporal dynamics of propagating acoustic fields in these devices and see the device in action. Two representative examples we discuss here are pulse circulation and ringdown in an acoustic microring resonator, and the observation of (parasitic) multipath interference effects in waveguide resonator geometries. In the absence of fast 3D acoustic field imaging modalities, such time domain reflectometry based methods provide the best alternative for mapping interface reflection and loss, which becomes increasingly critical as these devices start to scale in complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopes can record the dynamics of living cells with high spatio-temporal resolution in a single plane. However, monitoring rapid and dim fluorescence fluctuations, e.g induced by neuronal activity in the brain, remains challenging for 3D-distributed emitters due to out-of-focus fluorescence background, a restricted photon budget, and the speed limit of conventional scanning systems. Here, we introduce a Thermally Adaptive Surface strategy, capable of simultaneously recording, at camera framerate, the activity of 3D-distributed objects. This innovative microscope leverages on an array of thermally tuneable microlenses that offer low chromatic aberration and high transmission, and can be combined with patterned illumination to provide optical sectioning. We demonstrate its potential in vivo, by simultaneously monitoring fast fluorescent dynamics at different depths in the zebrafish larval brain, at a rate of 0.5 kHz and over a large field of view (360um x 360um).</description>

      <title>Self-interfering high harmonic beam arrays driven by Hermite-Gaussian beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of structured light to drive highly nonlinear processes in matter not only enables imprinting spatially-resolved properties onto short-wavelength radiation, but also opens alternative avenues for exploring the dynamics of nonlinear laser-matter interactions. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically explore the unique properties of driving high-order harmonic generation (HHG) with Hermite-Gaussian beams. HHG driven by Laguerre-Gauss modes results in harmonics that inherit the azimuthal Laguerre-Gauss modal structure, with their topological charge scaling according to orbital angular momentum conservation. In contrast, when HHG is driven by Hermite-Gauss beams, the harmonic modes do not show a direct correspondence to the driving modal profile. Our experimental measurements using HG$_{0,1}$ and HG$_{1,1}$ modes, which are in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations, show that the lobes of the Hermite-Gauss driving beams effectively produce a set of separate phase-locked harmonic beamlets which can interfere downstream. This self-interference, which can be adjusted through the relative position between the gas target and the driving beam focus, can be exploited for precision extreme-ultraviolet interferometry. We demonstrate a simple application to calibrate the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet diffraction grating. In addition, we show through simulations that the array of harmonic beamlets can be used as an illumination source for single-shot extreme-ultraviolet ptychography.</description>

      <title>Crossed Ponderomotive Lenses for Spherical Aberration Correction in Electron Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article evaluates the lens characteristics of a non-rotationally symmetric electron lens based on a ponderomotive potential (i.e., a ponderomotive lens) formed by intersecting one or more optical beams perpendicular to an electron beam. Based on geometric optics, design formulas are derived for the focal length and general spherical aberration coefficients of specifically crossed ponderomotive lenses. Numerical calculations demonstrate that a pair of these crossed ponderomotive lenses can effectively correct spherical aberration in the objective lens of an electron microscope. Unlike rotationally symmetric ponderomotive lenses, which require the optical beam to be coaxially aligned with the electron beam, the crossed ponderomotive lens avoids the need to place optical mirrors and lenses directly on the beam axis. Thus, it offers practical advantages in designing and building electron optical instruments and contributes to system miniaturization. With lens properties similar to multipole lenses, the proposed crossed ponderomotive lens is expected to facilitate diverse developments in electron optical systems incorporating ponderomotive potentials.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.</description>

Abstract: Experimental tests of gravity's fundamental nature call for mechanical systems in the quantum regime while being sensitive to gravity. Torsion pendula, historically vital in studies of classical gravity, are ideal for extending gravitational tests into the quantum realm due to their inherently high mechanical quality factor, even when mass-loaded. Here, we demonstrate laser cooling of a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator to a temperature of 10 mK (average occupancy of 6000 phonons) starting from room temperature. This is achieved by optical radiation pressure forces conditioned on a quantum-noise-limited optical measurement of the torsional mode with an imprecision 9.8 dB below its peak zero-point motion. The measurement sensitivity is the result of a novel `mirrored' optical lever that passively rejects extraneous spatial-mode noise by 60 dB. The high mechanical quality ($1.4\times 10^7$) and quantum-noise-limited measurement imprecision demonstrate the necessary ingredients for realizing the quantum ground state of torsional motion -- a pre-requisite for mechanical tests of gravity's alleged quantum nature.</description>

      <title>Chip-integrated single-mode coherent-squeezed light source using four-wave mixing in microresonators</title>

Abstract: Squeezed light constitutes a key resource for quantum optical technologies including quantum sensing, computing, communication and metrology. For many applications the generation of squeezed light typically requires at least two nonlinear optical stages involving careful phase and frequency matching to achieve the required mixing of squeezed and coherent light. In our work, we introduce an on-chip system that simplifies the generation of coherent-squeezed light, utilizing only a single squeezing stage. We achieve this by pumping a silicon nitride ($\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$) microring resonator to produce single-mode squeezed light through four-wave mixing at the same frequency as the pump mode, leveraging the inherent $\chi^{(3)}$-nonlinearity of the $\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ resonator. Our on-chip system demonstrates a squeezing of -4.7 dB with a clear perspective towards -10 dB squeezing. We also provide a theoretical model that describes the straightforward yet robust generation of single-mode squeezing at the injection locking point of the ring resonator. In fact, we show that a design with a normal dispersion can be used for robust generation of bright squeezed light without the need for careful suppression of unwanted nonlinear processes. Overall, our findings highlight an approach which drastically simplifies the generation of coherent-squeezed light in photonic integrated circuits.</description>
