      <title>The nonlinear dynamics of a cantilever beam subject to axial flow in a tapered passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cantilever beam under axial flow, confined or not, is known to develop self-sustained oscillations at sufficiently large flow velocities. In recent decades, the analysis of this archetypal system has been mostly pursued under linearized conditions, to calculate the critical boundaries separating stable from unstable behavior. However, nonlinear analysis of the self-sustained oscillations ensuing flutter instabilities are considerably rarer. Here we present a simplified one-dimensional nonlinear model describing a cantilever beam subjected to confined axial flow, for generic axial profiles of the fluid channels. In particular, we explore how the shape of the confinement walls affects the dynamics of the system. To simplify the problem, we consider symmetric channels with plane walls in either converging or diverging configurations. The beam is modeled in a modal framework, while bulk-flow equations, including singular head-loss terms, are used to model the flow-structure coupling forces. The dynamics of the system are first analyzed through linear stability analysis to assess the stabilizing/destabilizing effects of the channel walls configuration. Subsequently, we develop a systematic nonlinear analysis based on the continuation of periodic solutions. The harmonic balance method is used in conjunction with the asymptotic numerical method to calculate branches of periodic solutions. The continuation-based methods are used to investigate bifurcations with respect to both the reduced flow velocity and the channel slope parameter. From the results presented, we illustrate how continuationbased approaches and bifurcation analysis provide an efficient tool to analyze the nonlinear behavior of flow-induced vibration problems, particularly when reduced/simplified models are available.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Regulating protocols of globally coupled continuum systems: Effects on dynamics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling and understanding phenomena in coupled systems remains a significant challenge across diverse fields. This study investigates a simple globally coupled chemical system that exhibits a range of rich collective dynamics, from coherence to chimera states, controllable by a system parameter. We explore the effects of altering this control parameter using two different protocols. In protocol-I, a continuous variation of the control parameter leads to memory effects, resulting in two distinct sets of phenomena in the forward and reverse directions. In contrast, protocol-II, which includes a resetting feature, yields an entirely distinct collection of behaviors. Additionally, we capture the evolution of key elements of nonequilibrium thermodynamics associated with these dynamical states under both protocols, revealing distinct signatures for each. This work highlights the complexity and uniqueness of regulating coupled systems via control parameters compared to corresponding single systems, and it carries potential implications for the manipulation and application of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>From chimeras to extensive chaos in networks of heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Populations of coupled oscillators can exhibit a wide range of complex dynamical behavior, from complete synchronization to chimera and chaotic states. We can thus expect complex dynamics to arise in networks of such populations. Here we analyze the dynamics of networks of populations of heterogeneous mean-field coupled Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators, and show that the instability that leads to chimera states in a simple two-population model also leads to extensive chaos in large networks of coupled populations. Formally, the system consists of a complex network of oscillator populations whose mesoscopic behavior evolves according to the Ott-Antonsen equations. By considering identical parameters across populations, the system contains a manifold of homogeneous solutions where all populations behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous states provided by the master stability function formalism shows that non-trivial dynamics might emerge on a wide region of the parameter space for arbitrary network topologies. As examples, we first revisit the two-population case, and provide a complete bifurcation diagram. Then, we investigate the emergent dynamics in large ring and Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks. In both cases, transverse instabilities lead to extensive space-time chaos, i.e., irregular regimes whose complexity scales linearly with the system size. Our work provides a unified analytical framework to understand the emergent dynamics of networks of oscillator populations, from chimera states to robust high-dimensional chaos.</description>
