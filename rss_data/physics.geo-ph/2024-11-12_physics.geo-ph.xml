      <title>Dictionary Learning with Convolutional Structure for Seismic Data Denoising and Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data inevitably suffers from random noise and missing traces in field acquisition. This limits the utilization of seismic data for subsequent imaging or inversion applications. Recently, dictionary learning has gained remarkable success in seismic data denoising and interpolation. Variants of the patch-based learning technique, such as the K-SVD algorithm, have been shown to improve denoising and interpolation performance compared to the analytic transform-based methods. However, patch-based learning algorithms work on overlapping patches of data and do not take the full data into account during reconstruction. By contrast, the data patches (CSC) model treats signals globally and, therefore, has shown superior performance over patch-based methods in several image processing applications. In consequence, we test the use of CSC model for seismic data denoising and interpolation. In particular, we use the local block coordinate descent (LoBCoD) algorithm to reconstruct missing traces and clean seismic data from noisy input. The denoising and interpolation performance of the LoBCoD algorithm has been compared with that of K-SVD and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms using synthetic and field data examples. We use three quality measures to test the denoising accuracy: the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the relative L2-norm of the error (RLNE), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). We find that LoBCoD performs better than K-SVD and OMP for all test cases in improving PSNR and SSIM, and in reducing RLNE. These observations suggest a huge potential of the CSC model in seismic data denoising and interpolation applications.</description>

      <title>Pi theorem formulation of flood mapping</title>

Abstract: Rapid delineation of flash flood extents is critical to mobilize emergency resources and to manage evacuations, thereby saving lives and property. Machine learning (ML) approaches enable rapid flood delineation with reduced computational demand compared to conventional high-resolution, 2D flood models. However, existing ML approaches are limited by a lack of generalization to never-before-seen conditions. Here, we propose a framework to improve ML model generalization based on dimensionless, multi-scale features that capture the similarity of the flooding process across regions. The dimensionless features are constrained with the Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem and used with a logistic regression model for a probabilistic determination of flood risk. The features were calculated at different scales by varying accumulation thresholds for stream delineation. The modeled flood maps compared well with the results of 2D hydraulic models that are the basis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard maps. Dimensionless features outperformed dimensional features, with some of the largest gains (in the AUC) occurring when the model was trained in one region and tested in another. Dimensionless and multi-scale features in ML flood modeling have the potential to improve generalization, enabling mapping in unmapped areas and across a broader spectrum of landscapes, climates, and events.</description>

      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>
