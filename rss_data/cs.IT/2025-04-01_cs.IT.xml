      <title>Beamforming Design for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient beamforming design is proposed for continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA)-MIMO systems, whose optimal beamforming can be obtained using singular-value decomposition, CAPA-MIMO systems require solving the eigendecomposition of a Hermitian kernel operator, which is computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, an explicit closed-form expression for the achievable rate of CAPA-MIMO systems is first derived as a function of the continuous transmit beamformer. Subsequently, an iterative weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm is proposed, directly addressing the CAPA-MIMO beamforming optimization without discretization approximation. Closed-form updates for each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm are derived via the calculus of variations (CoV) method. For low-complexity implementation, an equivalent matrix-based iterative solution is introduced using Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Our numerical results demonstrate that 1) CAPA-MIMO achieves substantial performance gain over the SPDA-MIMO, 2) the proposed WMMSE algorithm enhances performance while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art Fourier-based approaches, and 3) the proposed WMMSE algorithm enables practical realization of parallel, non-interfering transmissions.</description>

      <title>Geo2ComMap: Deep Learning-Based MIMO Throughput Prediction Using Geographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate communication performance prediction is crucial for wireless applications such as network deployment and resource management. Unlike conventional systems with a single transmit and receive antenna, throughput (Tput) estimation in antenna array-based multiple-output multiple-input (MIMO) systems is computationally intensive, i.e., requiring analysis of channel matrices, rank conditions, and spatial channel quality. These calculations impose significant computational and time burdens. This paper introduces Geo2ComMap, a deep learning-based framework that leverages geographic databases to efficiently estimate multiple communication metrics across an entire area in MIMO systems using only sparse measurements. To mitigate extreme prediction errors, we propose a sparse sampling strategy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Geo2ComMap accurately predicts full-area communication metrics, achieving a median absolute error of 27.35 Mbps for Tput values ranging from 0 to 1900 Mbps.</description>

      <title>Robust Transmission Design for Active RIS-Aided Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from conventional passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), incident signals and thermal noise can be amplified at active RISs. By exploiting the amplifying capability of active RISs, noticeable performance improvement can be expected when precise channel state information (CSI) is available. Since obtaining perfect CSI related to an RIS is difficult in practice, a robust transmission design is proposed in this paper to tackle the channel uncertainty issue, which will be more severe for active RIS-aided systems. To account for the worst-case scenario, the minimum achievable rate of each user is derived under a statistical CSI error model. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum of the minimum achievable rate. Since the objective function is non-concave, the formulated problem is transformed into a tractable lower bound maximization problem, which is solved using an alternating optimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed robust design outperforms a baseline scheme that only exploits estimated CSI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasi-cyclic codes of index 2 over finite fields. We give a classification of such codes. Their duals with respect to the Euclidean, symplectic and Hermitian inner products are investigated. We describe self-orthogonal and dual-containing codes. Lower bounds for minimum distances of quasi-cyclic codes are given. A quasi-cyclic code of index 2 is generated by at most two elements. We describe conditions when such a code (or its dual) is generated by one element.</description>

      <title>Data Sourcing Random Access using Semantic Queries for Massive IoT Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently retrieving relevant data from massive Internet of Things (IoT) networks is essential for downstream tasks such as machine learning. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel data sourcing protocol that combines semantic queries and random access. The key idea is that the destination node broadcasts a semantic query describing the desired information, and the sensors that have data matching the query then respond by transmitting their observations over a shared random access channel, for example to perform joint inference at the destination. However, this approach introduces a tradeoff between maximizing the retrieval of relevant data and minimizing data loss due to collisions on the shared channel. We analyze this tradeoff under a tractable Gaussian mixture model and optimize the semantic matching threshold to maximize the number of relevant retrieved observations. The protocol and the analysis are then extended to handle a more realistic neural network-based model for complex sensing. Under both models, experimental results in classification scenarios demonstrate that the proposed protocol is superior to traditional random access, and achieves a near-optimal balance between inference accuracy and the probability of missed detection, highlighting its effectiveness for semantic query-based data sourcing in massive IoT networks.</description>

      <title>A divide-and-conquer sumcheck protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new sumcheck protocol called Fold-DCS (Fold-Divide-and-Conquer-Sumcheck) for multivariate polynomials based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. Its round complexity and soundness error are logarithmic in the number of variables, whereas they are linear in the classical sumcheck protocol. This drastic improvement in number of rounds and soundness comes at the expense of exchanging multivariate polynomials, which can be alleviated using polynomial commitment schemes. We first present Fold-DCS in the PIOP model, where the prover provides oracle access to a multivariate polynomial at each round. We then replace this oracle access in practice with a multivariate polynomial commitment scheme; we illustrate this with an adapted version of the recent commitment scheme Zeromorph [KT24], which allows us to replace most of the queries made by the verifier with a single batched evaluation check.</description>

      <title>REMAA: Reconfigurable Pixel Antenna-based Electronic Movable-Antenna Arrays for Multiuser Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable pixel antenna (RPA)-based electronic movable antennas (REMAs) for multiuser communications. First, we model each REMA as an antenna characterized by a set of predefined and discrete selectable radiation positions within the radiating region. Considering the trade-off between performance and cost, we propose two types of REMA-based arrays: the partially-connected RPA-based electronic movable-antenna array (PC-REMAA) and fully-connected REMAA (FC-REMAA). Then, we formulate a multiuser sum-rate maximization problem subject to the power constraint and hardware constraints of the PC-REMAA or FC-REMAA. To solve this problem, we propose a two-step multiuser beamforming and antenna selection scheme. In the first step, we develop a two-loop joint beamforming and antenna selection (TL-JBAS) algorithm. In the second step, we apply the coordinate descent method to further enhance the solution of the TL-JBAS algorithm. In addition, we revisit mechanical movable antennas (MMAs) to establish a benchmark for evaluating the performance of REMA-enabled multiuser communications, where MMAs can continuously adjust the positions within the transmission region. We also formulate a sum-rate maximization problem for MMA-enabled multiuser communications and propose an alternating beamforming and antenna position optimization scheme to solve it. Finally, we analyze the performance gap between REMAs and MMAs. Based on Fourier analysis, we derive the maximum power loss of REMAs compared to MMAs for any given position interval. Specifically, we show that the REMA incurs a maximum power loss of only 3.25\% compared to the MMA when the position interval is set to one-tenth of the wavelength. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization and Transfer Learning for Cellular Network Antenna Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach for large-scale cellular network optimization, using a production cellular network in London as a case study and employing Sionna ray tracing for site-specific channel propagation modeling. We optimize base station antenna tilts and half-power beamwidths, resulting in more than double the 10\%-worst user rates compared to a 3GPP baseline. In scenarios involving aerial users, we identify configurations that increase their median rates fivefold without compromising ground user performance. We further demonstrate the efficacy of model generalization through transfer learning, leveraging available data from a scenario source to predict the optimal solution for a scenario target within a similar number of iterations, without requiring a new initial dataset, and with a negligible performance loss.</description>

      <title>Tensor Generalized Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a tensor generalized approximate message passing (TeG-AMP) algorithm for low-rank tensor inference, which can be used to solve tensor completion and decomposition problems. We derive TeG-AMP algorithm as an approximation of the sum-product belief propagation algorithm in high dimensions where the central limit theorem and Taylor series approximations are applicable. As TeG-AMP is developed based on a general TR decomposition model, it can be directly applied to many low-rank tensor types. Moreover, our TeG-AMP can be simplified based on the CP decomposition model and a tensor simplified AMP is proposed for low CP-rank tensor inference problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve recovery performances since it takes full advantage of tensor structures.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs with subgraph compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the problem of reconstructing strings from their substring compositions first introduced by Acharya et al. in 2015 motivated by polymer-based advanced data storage systems utilizing mass spectrometry. Namely, we see strings as labeled path graphs, and as such try to reconstruct labeled graphs. For a given integer t, the subgraph compositions contain either vectors of labels for each connected subgraph of order t (t-multiset-compositions) or the sum of all labels of all connected subgraphs of order t (t-sum-composition). We ask whether, given a graph of which we know the structure and an oracle whom you can query for compositions, we can reconstruct the labeling of the graph. If it is possible, then the graph is reconstructable; otherwise, it is confusable, and two labeled graphs with the same compositions are called equicomposable. We prove that reconstructing through a brute-force algorithm is wildly inefficient, before giving methods for reconstructing several graph classes using as few compositions as possible. We also give negative results, finding the smallest confusable graphs and trees, as well as families with a large number of equicomposable non-isomorphic graphs. An interesting result occurs when twinning one leaf of a path: some paths are confusable, creating a twin out of a leaf sees the graph alternating between reconstructable and confusable depending on the parity of the path, and creating a false twin out of a leaf makes the graph reconstructable using only sum-compositions in all cases.</description>

      <title>Minimum Description Length of a Spectrum Variational Autoencoder: A Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained through end-to-end learning have achieved remarkable success across diverse machine learning tasks, yet they are not explicitly designed to adhere to the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which posits that the best model provides the shortest description of the data. In this paper, we argue that MDL is essential to deep learning and propose a further generalized principle: Understanding is the use of a small amount of information to represent a large amount of information. To this end, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for designing and evaluating deep Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) based on MDL. In our theory, we designed the Spectrum VAE, a specific VAE architecture whose MDL can be rigorously evaluated under given conditions. Additionally, we introduce the concept of latent dimension combination, or pattern of spectrum, and provide the first theoretical analysis of their role in achieving MDL. We claim that a Spectrum VAE understands the data distribution in the most appropriate way when the MDL is achieved. This work is entirely theoretical and lays the foundation for future research on designing deep learning systems that explicitly adhere to information-theoretic principles.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic randomness and the weak merging of computable probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize Martin-L\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness in terms of the merging of opinions, along the lines of the Blackwell-Dubins Theorem. After setting up a general framework for defining notions of merging randomness, we focus on finite horizon events, that is, on weak merging in the sense of Kalai-Lehrer. In contrast to Blackwell-Dubins and Kalai-Lehrer, we consider not only the total variational distance but also the Hellinger distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our main result is a characterization of Martin-L\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness in terms of weak merging and the summable Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main proof idea is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between $\mu$ and $\nu$, at a given stage of the learning process, is exactly the incremental growth, at that stage, of the predictable process of the Doob decomposition of the $\nu$-submartingale $L(\sigma)=-\ln \frac{\mu(\sigma)}{\nu(\sigma)}$. These characterizations of algorithmic randomness notions in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence can be viewed as global analogues of Vovk's theorem on what transpires locally with individual Martin-L\"of $\mu$- and $\nu$-random points and the Hellinger distance between $\mu,\nu$.</description>

      <title>Graphical Models and Efficient Inference Methods for Multivariate Phase Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate phase relationships are important to characterize and understand numerous physical, biological, and chemical systems, from electromagnetic waves to neural oscillations. These systems exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics and intricate interdependencies among their constituent elements. While classical models of multivariate phase relationships, such as the wave equation and Kuramoto model, give theoretical models to describe phenomena, the development of statistical tools for hypothesis testing and inference for multivariate phase relationships in complex systems remains limited. This paper introduces a novel probabilistic modeling framework to characterize multivariate phase relationships, with wave-like phenomena serving as a key example. This approach describes spatial patterns and interactions between oscillators through a pairwise exponential family distribution. Building upon the literature of graphical model inference, including methods like Ising models, graphical lasso, and interaction screening, this work bridges the gap between classical wave dynamics and modern statistical approaches. Efficient inference methods are introduced, leveraging the Chow-Liu algorithm for directed tree approximations and interaction screening for general graphical models. Simulated experiments demonstrate the utility of these methods for uncovering wave properties and sparse interaction structures, highlighting their applicability to diverse scientific domains. This framework establishes a new paradigm for statistical modeling of multivariate phase relationships, providing a powerful toolset for exploring the complexity of these systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Search for Deletion-Correcting Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding deletion-correcting codes of maximum size has been an open problem for over 70 years, even for a single deletion. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for constructing deletion-correcting codes. A code is a set of sequences satisfying certain constraints, and we construct it by greedily adding the highest-priority sequence according to a priority function. To find good priority functions, we leverage FunSearch, a large language model (LLM)-guided evolutionary search proposed by Romera et al., 2024. FunSearch iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines priority functions to construct large deletion-correcting codes. For a single deletion, our evolutionary search finds functions that construct codes which match known maximum sizes, reach the size of the largest (conjectured optimal) Varshamov-Tenengolts codes where the maximum is unknown, and independently rediscover them in equivalent form. For two deletions, we find functions that construct codes with new best-known sizes for code lengths \( n = 12, 13 \), and \( 16 \), establishing improved lower bounds. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-guided search for information theory and code design and represent the first application of such methods for constructing error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>On the Low-SNR Asymptotic Capacity of Two Types of Optical Wireless Channels under Average-Intensity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15756v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of optical wireless channels under average-intensity constraints. One is called the Gaussian optical intensity channel, where the channel output models the converted electrical current corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The other one is the Poisson optical intensity channel, where the channel output models the number of received photons corrupted by a dark current. When the average input intensity $\mathcal{E}$ is small, the capacity of the Gaussian optical intensity channel is shown to scale as $\mathcal{E}\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}}{2}}$, and the capacity of the Poisson optical intensity channel as $\mathcal{E}\log\log\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}$. This closes the existing capacity gaps in these two channels.</description>

      <title>Explicit Performance Bound of Finite Blocklength Coded MIMO: Time-Domain versus Spatiotemporal Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the sixth generation (6G), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) will be further developed to achieve TKu extreme connectivity. On the premise of ensuring the same rate and reliability, the spatial domain advantage of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has the potential to further shorten the time-domain code length and is expected to be a key enabler for the realization of TKu. Different coded MIMO schemes exhibit disparities in exploiting the spatial domain characteristics, so we consider two extreme MIMO coding schemes, namely, time-domain coding in which the codewords on multiple spatial channels are independent of each other, and spatiotemporal coding in which multiple spatial channels are jointly coded. By analyzing the statistical characteristics of information density and utilizing the normal approximation, we provide explicit performance bounds for finite blocklength coded MIMO under time-domain coding and spatiotemporal coding. It is found that, different from the phenomenon in time-domain coding where the performance declines as the blocklengths decrease, spatiotemporal coding can effectively compensate for the performance loss caused by short blocklengths by improving the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). These results indicate that spatiotemporal coding can optimally exploit the spatial dimension advantages of MIMO systems, enabling extremely low error-rate communication under stringent blocklengths constraint.</description>

      <title>Divergence Inequalities with Applications in Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data processing inequality is central to information theory and motivates the study of monotonic divergences. However, it is not clear operationally we need to consider all such divergences. We establish a simple method for Pinsker inequalities as well as general bounds in terms of $\chi^{2}$-divergences for twice-differentiable $f$-divergences. These tools imply new relations for input-dependent contraction coefficients. We use these relations to show for many $f$-divergences the rate of contraction of a time homogeneous Markov chain is characterized by the input-dependent contraction coefficient of the $\chi^{2}$-divergence. This is efficient to compute and the fastest it could converge for a class of divergences. We show similar ideas hold for mixing times. Moreover, we extend these results to the Petz $f$-divergences in quantum information theory, albeit without any guarantee of efficient computation. These tools may have applications in other settings where iterative data processing is relevant.</description>

      <title>Group Testing with General Correlation Using Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group testing, a problem with diverse applications across multiple disciplines, traditionally assumes independence across nodes' states. Recent research, however, focuses on real-world scenarios that often involve correlations among nodes, challenging the simplifying assumptions made in existing models. In this work, we consider a comprehensive model for arbitrary statistical correlation among nodes' states. To capture and leverage these correlations effectively, we model the problem by hypergraphs, inspired by [GLS22], augmented by a probability mass function on the hyper-edges.
  Using this model, we first design a novel greedy adaptive algorithm capable of conducting informative tests and dynamically updating the distribution. Performance analysis provides upper bounds on the number of tests required, which depend solely on the entropy of the underlying probability distribution and the average number of infections. We demonstrate that the algorithm recovers or improves upon all previously known results for group testing settings with correlation. Additionally, we provide families of graphs where the algorithm is order-wise optimal and give examples where the algorithm or its analysis is not tight. We then generalize the proposed framework of group testing with general correlation in two directions, namely noisy group testing and semi-non-adaptive group testing. In both settings, we provide novel theoretical bounds on the number of tests required.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Transform for Fractional Programming in Signal Processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional programming (FP) is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with the optimization of ratios. It is an invaluable tool for signal processing and machine learning, because many key metrics in these fields are fractionally structured, e.g., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in wireless communications, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) in radar sensing, the normalized cut in graph clustering, and the margin in support vector machine (SVM). This article provides a comprehensive review of both the theory and applications of a recently developed FP technique known as the quadratic transform, which can be applied to a wide variety of FP problems, including both the minimization and the maximization of the sum of functions of ratios as well as matrix-ratio problems.</description>

      <title>Age of Information in Short Packet Multi-Connectivity Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate multi-connectivity (MC) schemes in the context of status update systems with short payloads. As a performance metric, we use the age of information (AoI). Due to short payloads, transmission errors must be taken into account. In addition to the well-known schemes of packet duplication, message splitting, and multiplexing, we propose a codeword splitting scheme, where each status update is jointly encoded across multiple channels. We derive closed-form expressions of the average AoI for the different schemes and optimize their corresponding parameters, such as blocklengths, message splits, and the cyclic schedule for the multiplexing scheme. Analytical comparisons and numerical evaluations show that the codeword splitting scheme achieves the lowest average AoI when joint encoding and decoding are possible. In scenarios where joint encoding is not feasible, whether message splitting or multiplexing results in a lower average AoI depends on the specific parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal generalisation and learning transition in extensive-width shallow neural networks near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a teacher-student model of supervised learning with a fully-trained two-layer neural network whose width $k$ and input dimension $d$ are large and proportional. We provide an effective theory for approximating the Bayes-optimal generalisation error of the network for any activation function in the regime of sample size $n$ scaling quadratically with the input dimension, i.e., around the interpolation threshold where the number of trainable parameters $kd+k$ and of data $n$ are comparable. Our analysis tackles generic weight distributions. We uncover a discontinuous phase transition separating a "universal" phase from a "specialisation" phase. In the first, the generalisation error is independent of the weight distribution and decays slowly with the sampling rate $n/d^2$, with the student learning only some non-linear combinations of the teacher weights. In the latter, the error is weight distribution-dependent and decays faster due to the alignment of the student towards the teacher network. We thus unveil the existence of a highly predictive solution near interpolation, which is however potentially hard to find by practical algorithms.</description>
