      <title>From enrollment to exams: Perceived stress dynamics among first-year physics students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current dropout rate in physics studies in Germany is about 60%, with the majority of dropouts occurring in the first year. Consequently, the physics study entry phase poses a significant challenge for many students. Students' stress perception can provide more profound insights into the processes and challenges during that period. In a panel study featuring 67 measuring points involving up to 128 participants at each point, we investigated the students' stress perception with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), identified underlying sources of stress, and assessed the self-estimated workload across two different cohorts. This examination occurred mostly every week during the first, and for one cohort also in the second semester, yielding a total of 3,206 PSQ data points and 5,823 stressors. The PSQ data indicate a consistent stress trajectory across all three groups studied that is characterized by significant dynamics between measuring points, spanning from $M=20.1, SD=15.9$ to $M=63.6, SD=13.4$ on the scale from 0 to 100. The stress level rises in the first lecture weeks, followed by a stable, elevated stress level until the exams and a relaxation phase afterward during the lecture-free time and Christmas vacation. In the first half of the lecture period, students primarily indicate the weekly exercise sheets, the physics lab course, and math courses as stressors; later on, preparation for exams and the exams themselves emerge as the most important stressors. Together with the students' self-estimated workload that correlates with the PSQ score, we can depict a coherent picture of stress perception among first-year physics students. This study enhances the understanding of stress perception and its potential management.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT in Dialogic Teaching Using Electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</description>
