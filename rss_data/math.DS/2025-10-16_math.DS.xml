      <title>On infinite sumsets and sets of multiple recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer two questions of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson regarding the existence of infinite sumsets of the form $B + C$ in dense and sparse sets of integers and the relation of sumsets to sets of recurrence. We then further generalize these results, yielding new characterizations of sets of multiple measurable and topological recurrence.</description>

      <title>S-Expansiveness and Zip Shift Maps in Symbolic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of S-expansiveness for local homeomorphisms and demonstrate that a class of extended symbolic dynamics, known as zip shift maps, are S-expansive and possess the shadowing property. Furthermore, we prove that any S-expansive local homeomorphism is a factor of a zip shift map.</description>

      <title>Finite and infinite invariant measures for adic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the invariant Borel measures for adic transformations, where the alphabets have bounded size and the measure is finite on the path space of some sub-Bratteli diagram.
  We develop a nonstationary version of the Frobenius normal form for a reducible matrix, present an appropriate nonstationary notion of distinguished eigenvector, and prove a nonstationary Frobenius--Victory theorem. This parallels the approach to the stationary case developed by Bezuglyi, Kwiatkowski, Medynets and Solomyak in arXiv:0812.1088 where they classify the locally finite invariant measures. In later work, they also address the nonstationary case. We extend this in two ways. Firstly, in both the stationary and nonstationary settings, we allow for measures which are locally infinite, motivating this extension with examples. Secondly we give a complete classification, presenting a necessary and sufficient condition for a measure which is finite on some subdiagram to be infinite for the original diagram. As part of our program, we introduce a related object called an adic tower and a construction called the canonical cover of the subdiagram: if the measure is finite on the subdiagram but locally infinite on the original space it will be locally finite on the cover space, though the path spaces for the original diagram and the cover are measure-theoretically isomorphic. Our examples include two new models for the Integer Cantor Set transformation of [Fisher1992], one locally finite and one locally infinite, which lead to a new class of examples related to fractal sets of integers: nested circle rotations, where one rotation is embedded in another. The resulting tower measure inside the original rotation can have finite or infinite total mass as determined by our general criterion.</description>

      <title>Structure and input-to-state stability for composable computations in chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of molecular computation based on chemical reaction networks (CRNs), leveraging parallelism to enable coupled mass-action systems (MASs) to retain predefined computational functionality has been a research focus. MASs exhibiting this property are termed composable. This paper investigates the structural conditions under which two MASs are composable. By leveraging input-to-state stability (ISS) property, we identify a specific class of CRN architectures that guarantee composability with other networks. A concrete example demonstrates the validity of this conclusion and illustrates the application of composability in computing composite functions.</description>

      <title>Expansiveness for flows on noncompact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of topological expansive flow. We prove that this concept is invariant by topological conjugacy and reduces to expansivity in the compact case. We characterize tiopological expansive flows as rescaling expansive flows for which the singularities are isolated points of the space. Finally, we prove that the growth rate of the periodic orbits of a topological expansive flow which is dynamically isolated at infinity is controlled by an entropy-like invariant. This extends Bowen-Walters inequality for expansive flows on compact spaces.</description>

      <title>Almost sure orbits closeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the minimal distance between orbits of measure
  preserving dynamical systems. In the spirit of dynamical
  shrinking target problems we identify distance rates for which
  almost sure asymptotic closeness properties can be
  ensured. More precisely, we consider the set $E_n$ of pairs of
  points whose orbits up to time $n$ have minimal distance to
  each other less than the threshold $r_n$. We obtain bounds on
  the sequence $(r_n)_n$ to guarantee that $\limsup_{n}E_n$ and
  $\liminf_{n} E_n$ are sets of measure 0 or 1. Results for the
  measure 0 case are obtained in broad generality while the
  measure one case requires assumptions of exponential mixing for
  at least one of the systems. We also consider the analogous
  question of the minimal distance of points within a single
  orbit of one dimensional exponentially mixing dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Some invariant classes for parabolic renormalization in the multicritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parabolic renormalization associates to a holomorphic map f with a parabolic fixed point another holomorphic map with a parabolic fixed point. This procedure is essential for understanding the phenomenon of parabolic enrichment, which occurs when one perturbs f appropriately. Shishikura defined in [Shi98] (see also [LY14]) a class of maps that is stable under this parabolic renormalization operator. These maps have only one critical point in their immediate basins. We extend here this result to the more general classes of maps conjugated on their immediate basins to finite Blaschke products. For these classes, we introduce an analogue of Milnor's mapping schemes [Mil12] and describe the action of parabolic renormalization on the scheme. This shall be a starting point to the fine study of perturbation of these bigger classes of maps.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduced Modeling of Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience to model the collective activity of neurons during behavioral tasks. The high dimensionality of their parameter and activity spaces, however, often make it challenging to infer and interpret the fundamental features of their dynamics.
  In this study, we employ recent nonlinear dynamical system techniques to uncover the core dynamics of several RNNs used in contemporary neuroscience. Specifically, using a data-driven approach, we identify Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs), i.e., low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds tangent to the eigenspaces of fixed points. The internal dynamics of SSMs serve as nonlinear models that reduce the dimensionality of the full RNNs by orders of magnitude.
  Through low-dimensional, SSM-reduced models, we give mathematically precise definitions of line and ring attractors, which are intuitive concepts commonly used to explain decision-making and working memory. The new level of understanding of RNNs obtained from SSM reduction enables the interpretation of mathematically well-defined and robust structures in neuronal dynamics, leading to novel predictions about the neural computations underlying behavior.</description>

      <title>Computation of minimal periods for ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the shortest possible period for an exactly periodic solution to some given autonomous ordinary differential equation. We show that, given a pair of Lyapunov-like observable functions defined over the state space of the corresponding dynamical system and satisfying a certain pointwise inequality, we can obtain a global lower bound for such periods. We give a method valid for the case of bounding the period of only those solutions which are invariant under a symmetry transformation, as well as bounds for general periodic orbits. If the governing equations are polynomial in the state variables, we can use semidefinite programming to find such auxiliary functions computationally, and thus compute lower bounds which can be rigorously validated using rational arithmetic. We apply our method to the Lorenz and Henon-Heiles systems. For both systems we are able to give validated bounds which are sharp to several decimal places.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation of spiking oscillations from a center in resonate-and-fire neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theta rhythm is important for many cognitive functions including spatial processing, memory encoding, and memory recall. The information processing underlying these functions is thought to rely on consistent, phase-specific spiking throughout a theta oscillation that may fluctuate significantly in baseline (center of oscillations), frequency, or amplitude. Experimental evidence shows that spikes can occur at specific phases even when the baseline membrane potential varies significantly, such that the integrity of phase-locking persists across a large variability in spike threshold. The mechanism of this precise spike timing during the theta rhythm is not yet known and previous mathematical models have not reflected the large variability in threshold potential seen experimentally. Here we introduce a straightforward mathematical neural model capable of demonstrating a phase-locked spiking in the face of significant baseline membrane potential fluctuation during theta rhythm. This novel approach incorporates a degenerate grazing bifurcation of an asymptotically stable oscillation. This model suggests a potential mechanism for how biological neurons can consistently produce spikes near the peak of a variable membrane potential oscillation.</description>

Abstract: We calculate slow entropy type invariant introduced by A. Katok and J.-P. Thouvenot in [5] for higher rank smooth abelian actions for two leading cases: when the invariant measure is absolutely continuous and when it is hyperbolic. We generalize Brin-Katok local entropy Theorem to the abelian action for the above two cases. We also prove that, for abelian actions, the transversal Hausdorff dimensions are universal, i.e. dependent on the action but not on any individual element of the action.</description>

      <title>Drift estimation in stochastic flows using kernel integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10698v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timeseries generated from a dynamical source can often be modeled as sample paths of a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The timeseries thus reflects the motion of a particle which flows along the direction provided by a drift / vector field, and is simultaneously scattered by the effect of white noise. The resulting motion can only be described as a random process instead of a solution curve. Due to the non-deterministic nature of this motion, the task of determining the drift from data is quite challenging, since the data does not directly represent the directional information of the flow. This paper describes an interpretation of a drift as a conditional expectation, which makes its estimation feasible via kernel-integral methods. In addition, some techniques are proposed to overcome the challenge of dimensionality if the SDE's carry some structure enabling sparsity. The technique is shown to be convergent, consistent and permits a wide choice of kernels.</description>

      <title>Correspondences on Riemann surfaces and non-uniform hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider certain correspondences on a Riemann surface, and show that they admit a weak form of hyperbolicity: sufficiently long loops get shorter under lifting at a fixed point and closing. In terms of their algebraic encoding by bisets, this translates to contraction of fundamental group elements along sequences arising from iterated lifting.
  As an application, we show that apart from the usual Latt\`es counterexamples, for any rational map on $\mathbb P^1$ with $4$ post-critical points, there is a finite invariant collection of isotopy classes of curves into which every curve is attracted under iterated lifting. More generally, among graphs of given complexity, there exists a finite invariant collect ion of isotopy classes of graphs into which every graph is attracted. Applied to sufficiently rich graphs, the graph attr actor provides a finite set of topological normal forms for the rational map.
  We also present a strategy towards proving the same statements for maps with more than $4$ post-critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Lasota-Yorke inequality for the Frobenius-Perron Operator of a piecewise expanding $C^{1+\varepsilon}$ map of an interval. By adapting this inequality to satisfy the assumptions of the Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu ergodic theorem \cite{ionescu1950}, we demonstrate the existence of an absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) for the map. Furthermore, we prove the quasi-compactness of the Frobenius-Perron operator induced by the map. Additionally, we explore significant properties of the system, including weak mixing and exponential decay of correlations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kac's lemma determines the expected return time to a set of positive measure under iterations of an ergodic probability preserving transformations. We introduce the notion of an \emph{allocation} for a probability preserving action of a countable group. Using this notion, we formulate and prove generalization of Kac's lemma for an action of a general countable group, and another generalization that applies to probability preserving equivalence relations. As an application, we provide a short proof for the existence of countable generating partitions for any ergodic action of a countable group.</description>

      <title>Random 2D linear cocycles II: statistical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the space of two dimensional random linear cocycles over a shift in finitely many symbols, with at least one singular and one invertible matrix. We provide an explicit formula for the unique stationary measure associated to such cocycles and establish a Furstenberg-type formula characterizing the Lyapunov exponent. Using the spectral properties of the corresponding Markov operator and a parameter elimination argument, we prove that Lebesgue almost every cocycle in this space satisfies large deviations estimates and a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>On Mirzakhani's twist torus conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a conjecture of Mirzakhani about the statistical behavior of certain expanding families of ``twist tori'' in the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces, showing that they equidistribute to a certain Lebesgue-class measure along almost all sequences. We also identify a number of other expanding families of twist tori whose limiting distributions are mutually singular to Lebesgue.</description>

      <title>On the set of stable primes for postcritically infinite maps over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many interesting questions in arithmetic dynamics revolve, in one way or another, around the (local and/or global) reducibility behavior of iterates of a polynomial. We show that for very general families of integer polynomials $f$ (and, more generally, rational functions over number fields), the set of stable primes, i.e., primes modulo which all iterates of $f$ are irreducible, is a density zero set. Compared to previous results, our families cover a much wider ground, and in particular apply to $100\%$ of polynomials of any given odd degree, thus adding evidence to the conjecture that polynomials with a "large" set of stable primes are necessarily of a very specific shape, and in particular are necessarily postcritically finite.</description>

      <title>On the dimension distortion under fractionally smooth mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the extent to which certain classes of fractionally `smooth' continuous mappings between metric spaces distort various dimensions, including the Hausdorff, upper Minkowski (box-counting), and upper intermediate dimensions. Our intermediate and Minkowski dimension distortion results are new even for continuous (fractional) Sobolev and, more generally, Triebel--Lizorkin and Besov mappings between Euclidean spaces, complementing the work of Hencl-Honz\'ik (2015) and Huynh (2022). Moreover, our results also extend the aforementioned work, as well as the work of Kaufman (2000) and Fraser-Tyson (2025) to certain weighted Euclidean spaces and, more generally, to doubling metric measure spaces. As an application of our main result, we quantify the corresponding dimension distortion properties of quasisymmetric mappings for non-Ahlfors regular subsets of metric measure spaces, strengthening a result of Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams (2016).</description>

      <title>On the Jacobs-de Leeuw-Glicksberg decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any JdLG-admissible representation $\pi$ of a semigroup $S$ on a Banach space $E$, we show that the reversible part is weakly equivalent to a unitary representation on a Hilbert space that decomposes into a direct sum of finite dimensional representations, and we give an alternative characterization of the almost weakly stable part in terms of the unique invariant mean on the space of weakly almost periodic functions. In the case that $S$ is a bi-amenable measured semigroup, we characterize the almost weakly stable part using invariant means and averages along F\o lner sequences. Moreover, we give a description of the unique projection onto the reversible part whose kernel is the almost weakly stable part in terms of ultrafilters.</description>
