      <title>Biodose Tools updates for criticality accidents and interlaboratory comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Since its initial release, the aim of Biodose Tools was to offer an easy-to-use platform to perform the mathematical calculations needed in biological dosimetry. This update 3.7.1, mainly focuses on new features related to large-scale emergency responses, like criticality accidents dose estimation and laboratory networks. Material and Methods: Biodose Tools has been developed using the R programming language. The current version (3.7.1) uses the same external dependencies as version 3.6.1 (released November 2022) while integrating three new external packages to support the new functionalities. Results: Version 3.7.1 introduces different new modules: (a) a characteristic limits module that calculates decision thresholds and detection limits following ISO19238:2023 standards, and offers statistical tests to compare rates between suspected exposure cases and control data; (b) an enhanced dose estimation module which supports multiple dose assessments for dicentric and translocation assays for various exposure scenarios (acute, protracted, and highly protracted) as well as whole and partial-body exposures; (c) a criticality accidents module for multiple dose estimations using dicentrics in mixed gamma-neutron exposure scenarios (e.g., nuclear detonations); and (d) an Interlaboratory comparison module that automates the evaluation and comparison of dose estimates across laboratories. Conclusions: Biodose Tools (biodosetools.reneb.bfs.de) continues to evolve in response to the dynamic needs of the biological dosimetry community, contributing to the preparedness and consistency in emergency response and routine applications.</description>

      <title>PHD-MS: Multiscale Domain Identification for Spatial Transcriptomics via Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at a set of spatial locations in a tissue. Communities of nearby cells that express similar genes form \textit{spatial domains}. Specialized ST clustering algorithms have been developed to identify these spatial domains. These methods often identify spatial domains at a single morphological scale, and interactions across multiple scales are often overlooked. For example, large cellular communities often contain smaller substructures, and heterogeneous frontier regions often lie between homogeneous domains. Topological data analysis (TDA) is an emerging mathematical toolkit that studies the underlying features of data at various geometric scales. It is especially useful for analyzing complex biological datasets with multiscale characteristics. Using TDA, we develop Persistent Homology for Domains at Multiple Scales (PHD-MS) to locate tissue structures that persist across morphological scales. We apply PHD-MS to highlight multiscale spatial domains in several tissue types and ST technologies. We also compare PHD-MS domains against ground-truth domains in expert-annotated tissues, where PHD-MS outperforms traditional clustering approaches. PHD-MS is available as an open-source software package with an interactive graphical user interface for exploring the identified multiscale domains.</description>

      <title>TrackStudio: An Integrated Toolkit for Markerless Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.
  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (&lt;13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.</description>

      <title>A bioreactor-based architecture for in vivo model-based and sim-to-real learning control of microbial consortium composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbial consortia offer significant biotechnological advantages over monocultures for bioproduction. However, industrial deployment is hampered by the lack of scalable architectures to ensure stable coexistence between populations. Existing strategies rely on genetic modifications, which impose metabolic load, or environmental changes, which can reduce production. We present a versatile control architecture to regulate density and composition of a two-strain consortium without genetic engineering or drastic environmental changes. Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain. For both chambers we develop model-based and sim-to-real learning controllers. The control architecture is then validated in vivo on a two-strain Escherichia coli consortium, achieving precise and robust regulation of consortium density and composition, including tracking of time-varying references and recovery from perturbations.</description>

      <title>Low-fat diets and testosterone in men: Systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Higher endogenous testosterone levels are associated with reduced chronic disease risk and mortality. Since the mid-20th century, there have been significant changes in dietary patterns, and men's testosterone levels have declined in western countries. Cross-sectional studies show inconsistent associations between fat intake and testosterone in men.
  Methods: Studies eligible for inclusion were intervention studies, with minimal confounding variables, comparing the effect of low-fat vs high-fat diets on men's sex hormones. 9 databases were searched from their inception to October 2020, yielding 6 eligible studies, with a total of 206 participants. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using Cochrane's Review Manager software. Cochrane's risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment.
  Results: There were significant decreases in sex hormones on low-fat vs high-fat diets. Standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes were: total testosterone [-0.38 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.01) P = 0.04]; free testosterone [-0.37 (95% CI -0.63 to -0.11) P = 0.005]; urinary testosterone [-0.38 (CI 95% -0.66 to -0.09) P = 0.009], and dihydrotestosterone [-0.3 (CI 95% -0.56 to -0.03) P = 0.03]. There were no significant differences for luteinising hormone or sex hormone binding globulin. Subgroup analysis for total testosterone, European and American men, showed a stronger effect [-0.52 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.3) P &lt; 0.001].
  Conclusions: Low-fat diets appear to decrease testosterone levels in men, but further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this effect. Men with European ancestry may experience a greater decrease in testosterone, in response to a low-fat diet.</description>

      <title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Modeling of Single-Cell Transcriptomics: Capturing Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Hallucinations in AlphaFold3 for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with disorder in Biological Process Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction has advanced significantly with the introduction of AlphaFold3, a diffusion-based model capable of predicting complex biomolecular interactions across proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and ions. While AlphaFold3 demonstrates high accuracy in folded proteins, its performance on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which comprise 30 to 40 percent of the human proteome and play critical roles in transcription, signaling, and disease, remains less explored. This study evaluated AlphaFold3's predictions of IDPs with a focus on intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) using 72 proteins curated from the DisProt database. Predictions were generated across multiple random seeds and ensemble outputs, and residue-level pLDDT scores were compared with experimental disorder annotations. Our analysis reveals that 32 percent of residues are misaligned with DisProt, with percent representing hallucinations where AlphaFold3 incorrectly predicts order in disordered regions or vice versa. Additionally, 10 percent of residues exhibited context-driven misalignment, suggesting that AlphaFold3 implicitly incorporates stable structural assumptions. Importantly, 18 percent of residues associated with biological processes showed hallucinations, raising concerns about downstream implications in drug discovery and disease research. These findings highlight the limitations of AlphaFold3 in modeling IDRs, the need for refined hallucination metrics beyond the pLDDT, and the importance of integrating experimental disorder data to improve prediction reliability.</description>

      <title>Selective Diabetic Retinopathy Screening with Accuracy-Weighted Deep Ensembles and Entropy-Guided Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Profiles for Protein Fitness Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; &gt;2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.</description>
