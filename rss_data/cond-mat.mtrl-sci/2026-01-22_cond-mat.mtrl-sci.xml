      <title>Photoluminescence Dynamics of CdSe QD/polymer Langmuir-Blodgett Thin Films: Morphology Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films of colloidal semiconductor CdSe quantum-dots (QDs) and a styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer were prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and their photoluminescence was characterized by confocal fluorescence lifetime microscopy. In the films, the photoluminescence dynamics are strongly affected by excitation energy migration between close-packed quantum-dots and energy trapping by surface-defective QDs or small clusters of aggregated QDs. Polymer/QD films with more aggregated QD regions exhibit lower PL intensities and faster decays, which we attribute primarily to the increased ability of excitations to find trap sites among more close-packed QD regions. This was confirmed by comparing films from bilayer or co-spreading deposition, and varying the QD-to-polymer composition or the surface pressure at deposition. The more regular films, such as those obtained by bilayer deposition at high-pressure, display more surface emission intensity and decays with less accentuated curvature. Decay analysis was performed with a model that accounts for excitation energy migration and trapping in the films. In the framework of the model, the photoluminescence dynamics are related to film morphology through the density of energy traps. A lower amount of QD clustering in the films reflects on a lower density of energy traps and, thus, on more emissive QD films, as inferred here for bilayer films relatively to co-spreading films.</description>

      <title>Nanoscopy of Excitons in Atomically Thin In-Plane Heterostructures with Nanointerfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically sharp 2D in-plane heterostructures with nanoscale interfaces provide a powerful platform for tailoring optical and electrical properties at the nanoscale, enabling novel device engineering and the exploration of new physical phenomena. However, direct experimental correlation between local dielectric response and excitonic properties across such interfaces has remained elusive. Here, we probed the nanoscale complex dielectric function and the corresponding localized photoluminescence (PL) modulations in heterostructure domains of lateral monolayer MoxW1-xS2 - WxMo1-xS2, synthesized using a liquid-phase precursor-assisted approach. Near-field nano imaging across the visible-near-infrared range enables real space mapping of sharp amplitude and phase changes at the heterointerface, resolving the local complex dielectric function with nano-meter scale spatial resolution. Excitation energy-dependent nano spectroscopy reveals a reversal of dielectric contrast between Mo-rich and W-rich domains at their respective excitonic resonances, consistent with Lorentz-oscillator fits. Complementary hyperspectral nano-PL mapping resolves the evolution of excitonic emission across the lateral heterointerface, with neutral-exciton intensities varying continuously from W-rich to Mo-rich regions. Effective-medium theory modeling of the imaginary part of the effective dielectric function of the heterostructure as a function of photon energy and Mo filling fraction reproduces the observed excitonic trends, linking the PL evolution to a composition-dependent dielectric response. Together, these results provide direct nanoscale correlation between dielectric and excitonic boundaries in laterally stitched monolayer heterostructures and establish a multimodal near-field spectroscopy framework for probing excitonic phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>3D bulk-resolved $g$-wave magnetic order parameter symmetry in the metallic altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic phases of matter, such as magnetism and superconductivity, are defined and distinguished by their order parameters that quantify the spontaneous symmetry breaking underlying each phase. The simplest cases are the uniform magnetisation of ferromagnets and isotropic gap function of conventional superconductors. Unconventional superconductors often have a nodal gap function, where the gap changes sign at nodes on the Fermi surface. This concept of unconventional or nodal order parameter symmetry has recently been extended to numerous magnetic systems, including altermagnets, in which up- and down-spin species are non-degenerate around the Fermi surface. Here we demonstrate that magnetic quantum oscillation measurements can provide a direct, bulk-sensitive, 3D mapping of the order parameter in an unconventional magnet. By rotating a magnetic field through high- and low-symmetry directions of the CrSb Brillouin zone, we show that this material's altermagetic band structure leads to the loss of mirror symmetry for each spin-split Fermi sheet away from highly symmetric nodal orientations. In momentum space, the difference between up and down spins follows the profile of the $\mathcal{Y}_{4}^{-3}=zy(3x^2-y^2)$ spherical harmonic - analogous to a $g$-orbital of the hydrogen atom. While notoriously difficult to resolve in unconventional superconductors, our work demonstrates that the order parameter symmetry of unconventional magnets can be conclusively determined through quantum-oscillatory quasiparticle spectroscopy. Our results empirically establish CrSb as a prototypical $g$-wave metallic altermagnet, which in pristine form possesses low residual resistivities down to $\sim$1 $\mu \Omega$cm, opening numerous avenues for next-generation spintronic device applications</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Transfer of Thin Film BaTiO$_3$ onto Silicon for Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin film BaTiO$_3$ has one of the highest known Pockels coefficients (&gt;1200 pm/V), making it an attractive material for use in electro-optic devices. It is advantageous to integrate BaTiO$_3$ on silicon to enable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible processing. However, synthesis of high-quality BaTiO$_3$ directly on silicon remains a challenge. Here, we synthesize BaTiO$_3$ using hybrid metal-organic molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE) and demonstrate its transfer onto silicon using thermocompression bonding and chemical lift-off. Hybrid metal-organic MBE enables self-regulated synthesis of highly stoichiometric thin films at high growth rates (&gt;100nm/hr). Our transfer method results in millimeter-scale areas of atomically flat, crack-free BaTiO$_3$ making it a potentially scalable method. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our process to device fabrication through characterization of lithographically-patterned and etch-transferred sub-micron features.</description>

      <title>Nanodroplet-Confined Electroplating Enables Submicron Printing of Metals and Oxide Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14576v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of functional micro- and nano-electronic devices requires the deposition of high-quality materials of different electronic material classes, such as conductors, semiconductors and insulators. To establish ultra-high-resolution additive manufacturing as a viable addition to existing fabrication methods requires the combinatorial additive deposition of different electronic material classes. However, current techniques do not provide such a capability. Here, we demonstrate that droplet confined electroplating, an ultra-high-resolution AM technique initially developed for metals as electrohydrodynamic redox printing (EHD-RP), allows not only the direct deposition of many metals, but also of metal-oxides. Particularly, we demonstrate that applying fundamental electrochemical principles in combination with on-the-fly switching of the deposited material allows for the direct co-deposition of metals, metal-hydroxides and -oxides. Our results exemplify the feasibility of leveraging simple water-based electrochemical concepts to produce intricate and multi-material structures at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Above Room Temperature Ferroelectricity in Epitaxially Strained KTaO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14627v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain is a powerful means to engineer emergent phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that KTaO3, a cubic perovskite in bulk form, can be epitaxially strained into a highly tunable ferroelectric. KTaO3 films grown commensurate to SrTiO3 (001) substrates experience an in-plane strain of -2.1 % that transforms the cubic structure into a tetragonal polar phase with transition temperature of 475 K, consistent with our thermodynamic calculations. We show that the Curie temperature and the spontaneous electric polarization can be system- atically controlled with epitaxial strain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals cooperative polar displacements of the potassium columns with respect to the neighboring tantalum columns at room temperature. Optical second-harmonic generation results are described by a tetragonal polar point group (4mm), indicating the emergence of a global polar ground state. We observe a ferroelectric hysteresis response, using metal-insulator-metal capacitor test structures. The results demon- strate a robust intrinsic ferroelectric state in epitaxially strained KTaO3 thin films.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Activation via Dihydride Formation on a Rh1/Fe3O4(001) Single-Atom Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen activation is a key elementary step in catalytic hydrogenation. In heterogeneous catalysis, it usually proceeds through dissociative adsorption on metal nanoparticles followed by surface diffusion or spillover, whereas homogeneous catalysts activate H2 through dihydride or dihydrogen intermediates at a single metal center. Here, we show that isolated Rh adatoms supported on Fe3O4(001) activate hydrogen through formation of a stable dihydride species without atomic H spillover. Temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy collectively reveal strong (approximately 1 eV) hydrogen adsorption exclusively at isolated Rh1 sites, while isotope-exchange experiments further demonstrate that hydrogen remains localized. Density-functional theory based calculations indicate a barrierless conversion from molecular H2 to the dihydride, and random-phase approximation calculations further confirm the relative stability of the dihydride. Together, these results show that single-atom Rh sites cleave and bind H2 through a dihydride pathway analogous to homogeneous complexes, establishing a mechanistic bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

      <title>Functionalization of reduced graphite oxide sheets with a zwitterionic surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Films of a few layers in thickness of reduced graphite oxide, RGO, sheets functionalized by the zwitterionic surfactant N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate, DDPS, are obtained by using the Langmuir-Blodgett method. The quality of the RGO sheets is checked by analyzing the degrees of reduction and defect repair by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy -AFM, field-emission scanning electron microscopy -SEM, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements. A modified Hummers method is used to obtain highly oxidized graphite oxide, GO, together with a centrifugation-based method to improve the quality of GO. The GO samples are reduced by hydrazine or vitamin C. Functionalization of RGO with the zwitterionic surfactant improves the degrees of reduction and defect repair of the two reducing agents and significantly increases the electrical conductivity of paperlike films compared with those prepared from unfunctionalized RGO.</description>

      <title>Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett films of a maleic anhydride derivative: effect of subphase divalent cations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the study of the equilibrium and dynamic properties of Langmuir monolayers of poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) partial 2-buthoxy ethyl ester cumene terminated polymer and the effect of the Mg(NO3)2 addition in the water subphase on the film properties. Results show that the polymer monolayer becomes more expanded when the electrolyte concentration in the subphase increases. Dense polymer films aggregate at the interface. The aggregates are transferred onto Silicon wafers using the Langmuir-Blodgett methodology and the morphology is observed by AFM. The structure of aggregates depends on the subphase composition of the Langmuir film transferred onto the silicon wafer.</description>

      <title>Influence of Charge Density Waves on the Hall coefficient in NiTi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mean-field charge density wave theory for NiTi using density functional theory bandstructure as a starting point. We calculate the Hall coefficient as a function of temperature and compare with recent experimental results. We analyze the contributions to the Hall coefficient from different parts of the Fermi surface and find that the Hall coefficient is dominated by certain ``hot spots''. The analysis shows that these hot spots are mostly dominated by Ni d-orbitals. We demonstrate that the Hall coefficient is not well reproduced by Boltzmann transport theory within the constant relaxation time approximation without charge density waves. We consider both uniaxial and biaxial charge density waves and show that biaxial charge density waves can account well for the Hall coefficient, while uniaxial cannot. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Near-Atomic-Scale Compositional Complexity in a 2D Transition Metal Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D materials hold transformative promise for next-generation nanoelectronics. However, successfully integrating these materials from laboratory-scale discoveries into real-world devices depends on precisely controlling their properties, which are fundamentally determined by their composition. Detailed characterisation using atom probe tomography of 2D Ti0.87O2, a candidate high-$\kappa$ dielectric, reveals deviations from its commonly assumed stoichiometry. Compositional analysis and comparison with the bulk K0.8[Ti1.73Li0.27]O4 precursor evidences an oxygen deficit indicative of oxygen vacancy formation in the 2D material, as well as the retention of low concentrations of alkali metals that were presumed to be removed during synthesis. Such deviations from stoichiometry indicate a reconstruction mechanism that mitigates the effect of the characteristic, negatively charged vacancies on the titanium sublattice, thereby influencing the local electronic structure and, consequently, functional properties. These findings underscore the importance of a detailed compositional analysis in both understanding and optimizing the extraordinary functional properties of 2D materials, opening pathways to tailored functionalities in next-generation nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Ionic transport in spontaneously ion-intercalated van der Waals layered structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport under strong confinement is crucial for the design of next-generation energy, catalytic, and information-processing materials; however, repeated field-driven ion motion often degrades conventional solid electrolytes. Van der Waals layered materials offer an alternative by providing structurally resilient ion-transport channels, yet the microscopic origins of their nonequilibrium transport behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate field-driven ionic conduction in sodium-intercalated layered MnO$_2$ as a model self-intercalated van der Waals solid, using all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that explicitly capture ion-water correlations and layer morphology. We demonstrate that ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, interlayer spacing, water content, and lattice flexibility. The applied electric field induces spatial segregation of water coupled to distortions of the MnO$_2$ sheets, producing coexisting regions populated by highly hydrated and weakly hydrated ions with suppressed conductivity. Concurrently, ionic transport exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the total amount of intercalated water, with boundary domains of weakly hydrated ions displaying relatively higher mobility. In fluctuation-free layers, ion transport transitions from single-particle motion to a collective conduction regime characterized by elongated, same-charge ionic clusters that violate Nernst-Einstein behavior. Together, these findings provide a molecular-level mechanism linking confinement-induced electrostatic correlations and structural response to the emergent nonlinear transport observed experimentally in ion-intercalated MnO$_2$, and suggest general design principles for robust, water-assisted ionic conductors.</description>

      <title>Significance of the dispersion force for ferroelectric switching in ZnO and related materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite-ZnO is a wide-bandgap polar material with a ferroelectric-switching barrier that is too high to utilize, but the barrier can be reduced and switching observed in substituted materials such as Zn0.5Mg0.5O. Here, we seek to understand atomic-scale features that control concerted polarization switching in these and related systems, focusing on the planar hexagonal structures h-ZnO and Zn0.5Mg0.5O that may act as metastable intermediate phases along the switching pathway. Consensus is obtained by considering a range of pure and dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (DFT) computational approaches, as well as ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF), M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation-theory (MP2), and random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations. The perceived stability of h-ZnO is found to be strongly influenced by the dispersion correction, with the consensus being that dispersion interactions are insufficient to stabilize h-ZnO as a metastable phase in infinite crystals. In contrast, h-Zn0.5Mg0.5O is consistently predicted to be at least metastable, with some dispersion-corrected DFT approaches predicting it to be more stable than its wurtzite form; all DFT methods overestimate its stability compared to MP2 and RPA. Dispersion forces are found to be most significant for hypothetical planar hexagonal structures constrained to the lattice vectors of the wurtzite phases. In general, our results demonstrate that an accurate treatment of dispersion forces is essential when describing polarization switching and ferroelectric behavior in wurtzite-structured materials.</description>

      <title>Role of Defects in the Paramagnetism of Fe-doped Cs$_{2}$AgBiBr$_{6}$ Double Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal doping enables the introduction of spin functionality into halide double perovskites, while simultaneously modifying optical properties. Here, we combine controlled single-crystal growth, optical characterization, comprehensive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and first-principles modeling to identify the microscopic nature of Fe-related centers in Fe-doped Cs$_{2}$AgBiBr$_{6}$. Single crystals with nominal Fe$^{3+}$ concentrations up to 15% in the precursor stage were grown using a controlled-cooling method, yielding reproducible Fe incorporation up to 0.1% w.r.t. Bi, without secondary phases. Despite this low concentration, Fe doping introduces electronic states that influence optical absorption and photoluminescence. EPR measurements reveal an S = 5/2 Fe$^{3+}$-related center whose anisotropy follows the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition below 120 K. Angular-dependent EPR resolves two configurations of this nearly axial spin center, with principal axes rotated by 90$^\circ$ and aligned with the $a/b$ plane of the tetragonal lattice. Density-functional calculations attribute these centers to impurity-vacancy complexes, most likely Fe$_{\rm Bi}$-V$_{\rm Br}$, that stabilise in a basal configuration of the low-temperature phase. This approach resolves vacancy-coupled defect orientations, narrowing possible models to Fe$^{3+}$-vacancy complexes and establishing them as stable, orientation-sensitive spin probes of structural symmetry in halide double perovskites, while providing a microscopic basis for tuning their magnetic and optical responses.</description>

      <title>3D tomographic imaging of skyrmionic cocoons using HERALDO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the rich and intricate characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic textures is essential for functional materials such as magnetic multilayers, where the delicate balance of various magnetic interactions leads to complex 3D spin arrangements. Among these textures, skyrmionic cocoons-tubular 3D magnetic structures characterized by a closed magnetization surface wrapping around a core-have emerged as particularly intriguing. Stabilized by competing magnetic interactions, these textures reside within a fraction of the thickness of the magnetic material and exhibit a typical lateral size of approximately 100 nm. Here, we present a vector tomographic reconstruction of the 3D magnetization in aperiodic Pt/Co/Al chiral multilayers, where skyrmionic cocoons have been recently reported. Using soft X-ray Holography with Extended Reference by Autocorrelation Linear Differential Operator (HERALDO), we acquire tomographic projections of the magnetic configuration and reconstruct the full 3D magnetization vector field with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 nm, as determined by Fourier shell correlation (FSC). This resolution allows us to observe critical features of the cocoons, such as their vertical misalignment and their overall chirality. Our findings demonstrate that HERALDO-based vector tomography is a powerful approach for revealing the internal structure and vertical extent of these nanoscale magnetic textures, offering new experimental insights into their intrinsic behavior.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Thermal Behavior of Photopolymers for In-Space Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future long-duration space missions will require in-situ, on-demand manufacturing of tools and components. Photopolymer-based processes are attractive for this purpose due to their low energy requirements, volume efficiency, and precise control of curing. However, photopolymerization generates significant heat, which is difficult to regulate in microgravity where natural convection is absent, leading to defects such as surface blistering and deformation. In this work, we combine experimental studies and modeling to address these thermal challenges. We report results from International Space Station (ISS) experiments and a dedicated parabolic flight campaign, which confirm that suppressed convective heat transfer in microgravity exacerbates thermal buildup and defect formation. Building on these observations, we present a predictive thermal model that couples heat transfer, light absorption, and evolving material properties to simulate polymerization and temperature evolution under terrestrial and microgravity conditions. Laboratory validation demonstrates strong agreement between model predictions and measured temperature profiles. Applying the model to the ISS experiments, we show that the model accurately reproduces experimentally observed blistering in TJ-3704A, a commercial acrylate-based polymer resin, while also predicting defect-free outcomes for Norland optical adhesives. The model functions as a design tool for defect-free in-space manufacturing, enabling selection of polymer properties, exposure strategies, and environmental conditions that together inhibit excess thermal buildup, paving the way for scalable, reliable in-situ manufacturing during future missions.</description>

      <title>Bending strain induced thermal conductivity suppression in freestanding BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes provide a novel platform for elastic strain engineering, enabling the manipulation of phonon transport free from substrate clamping. In this work, we investigate the thermal transport properties of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) membranes subjected to self-formed crease induced inhomogeneous strain. By integrating spatially resolved Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) with micro-Raman spectroscopy, we observe a sharp, localized suppression of thermal conductivity (k) in high-curvature regions. Specifically, k is reduced from 4.43 to 3.62 W/(m K) in SrTiO3 and from 2.27 to 1.81 W/(m K) in BaTiO3 at the crease centers, directly correlating with the local strain distribution. First-principles calculations reveal that, unlike uniform strain, the symmetry breaking induced by strain gradients significantly broadens phonon dispersion and enhances scattering rates. These findings not only elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing phonon-strain coupling but also demonstrate the potential of inhomogeneous strain fields as a potent tool for designing dynamic solid-state thermal switches and active thermal management devices.</description>

      <title>Pristine and Doped MoS2 Monolayers as Potential HCN Gas Sensors: A DFT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been extensively investigated due to their tunable properties. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate the adsorption behavior and sensing characteristics of HCN on pristine and doped MoS2 monolayers (X-MoS2, where X = P, N, Si, Al, B, Cl). The structural, electronic, and optical characteristics of all systems are examined to study the sensing properties of various doped MoS2 monolayers. In particular, the Al-MoS2 system demonstrates the strongest adsorption characterized by chemisorption, while the remaining systems show interactions of physisorption type. Recovery time and changes in electronic and optical properties reveal that Si-MoS2 possesses an ultrafast response of the order of microseconds, while Al-MoS2 exhibits a significantly longer recovery time, making it unsuitable for reusable sensors. P-MoS2, Si-MoS2, and Al-MoS2 monolayers show pronounced changes in their properties after HCN adsorption. To explore tunability in adsorption strength and recovery behavior, systems with two and three dopant atoms are further studied for P, Si, and Al doping. The results indicate that double doping enhances adsorption strength, whereas triple symmetric doping weakens it. Based on adsorption energy, recovery time, and electronic response, 2P-MoS2 and 3Al-MoS2 are identified as promising candidates for electrochemical and chemiresistive sensing of HCN. Additionally, the observed optical response in the ultraviolet region highlights their potential in UV-range optical sensor design.</description>

      <title>Quasisymmetry Enriched Gapless Criticality at Chern Insulator Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous topological phase transitions (CTPTs), the low-energy physics is governed by gap-closing subspaces, where approximate "higher" symmetries, termed quasisymmetries, may emerge. Here, we introduce the notion of quasisymmetry enrichment of these transitions. Focusing on paradigmatic normal-to-Chern insulator transitions, we identify quasisymmetries in the gapless subspaces, which subdivide CTPTs of the same universality class according to quasisymmetry charges. Gapless criticalities with nontrivial charges exhibit regulated phenomena, including intrinsic correlations between charge and pseudospin currents and continuous generalized Hall conductivities governed by the generalized St\v{r}eda formula, both conventionally exclusive to gapped phases. These features arise as quasisymmetry forbids certain matrix elements, rendering the generalized Berry curvature integrable. By establishing quasisymmetry as a fundamental classifying ingredient, our work adds a new dimension for understanding the rich landscape of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Chiral Splitting of Magnons in Two-Dimensional Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons in antiferromagnets exhibit two chiral modes, providing an intrinsic degree of freedom for magnon-based computing architectures and spintronic devices. Electrical control of chiral splitting is crucial for applications, but remains challenging. Here, we propose the concept of extrinsic chiral splitting, involving alternating and ferrimagnet-like types, which can be induced and controlled by an electric field. A symmetry framework based on 464 collinear spin layer groups is established to classify chiral splitting characteristics and electric field responses in two-dimensional magnets. We further elucidate how the spin layer group determines the type of alternating chiral splitting and the dominant lowest-order magnetic exchange interaction. We demonstrate electric-field control over the magnitude and sign of the chiral splitting, enabling control of the spin Seebeck and Nernst effects related to thermal spin transport. This work provides a general theory for electric field manipulation of magnon chirality, paving the way for low-power magnonic logic devices.</description>

      <title>Resolving the band alignment of InAs/InAsSb mid-wave-infrared type-II superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15053v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility in Hexagonal Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal diamond (h-diamond), or Lonsdaleite, has been reported to be a wide-bandgap semiconductor with high thermal conductivity and hardness. Our $ab initio$ calculations show that h-diamond has exceptionally high carrier mobility. Along $xy$ and $z$ directions, the hole mobilities at 300 K are 5631 and 5552 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, and the room-temperature electron mobilities are 11462 and 28464 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. These values are superior to the mobility of most known semiconductors including cubic diamond (c-diamond). The small effective masses in h-diamond, comparable to those in c-diamond, cannot explain the mobility difference between the two phases. For holes, scattering induced by transverse acoustic phonons is the predominant mechanism near room temperature in c-diamond, whereas considerably suppressed in d-diamond by selection rules. The high electron mobility in h-diamond can be attributed to the wavefunction at the conduction band minimum, which is extended and distributed primarily in the lattice interstitial, leading to weak coupling with scattering potentials. The temperature dependence of h-diamond is investigated as well, which deviates from the power-law relationship due to the significantly increased occupation of optical modes at elevated temperatures. Consequently, our findings reveal h-diamond as a promising high-mobility semiconductor, and elucidate the microscopic origin in terms of the carrier-phonon scattering mechanisms beyond conventional understandings based on simple parameters such as effective mass.</description>

      <title>Biphasic Meniscus Coating for Scalable and Material Efficient Quantum Dot Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (cQDs) have emerged as a cornerstone of next-generation optoelectronics, offering unparalleled spectral tunability and solution-processability. However, the transition from laboratory-scale devices to sustainable industrial manufacturing is fundamentally hindered by spin-coating workflows, which are intrinsically wasteful and restricted to planar geometries. These limitations are particularly acute for high-performance cQDs containing regulated elements such as lead, cadmium, or mercury, where poor material utilization exacerbates both environmental burden and cost. Here we report a biphasic dip-coating strategy that redefines the material efficiency of nanocrystal film fabrication. By utilizing an immiscible underlayer to displace ~88% of the active reservoir volume, we demonstrate a deposition geometry that decouples material consumption from total precursor volume. Infrared PbS photodetectors fabricated via this approach maintain their performance against spin-coated benchmarks while reducing ink consumption by up to 20-fold. Our technoeconomic analysis reveals that this biphasic architecture achieves cost parity at film thicknesses an order of magnitude lower than conventional monophasic dip-coating. Our results establish a low-waste framework for solution-processed materials, providing a viable pathway for the resource-efficient manufacturing of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Competition between clustering and dispersion of cobalt atoms on perovskite surfaces: SrTiO3(001) and KTaO3(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite oxides are attractive for reactions in photo/electrocatalytic schemes, and extrinsic doping is a common strategy for tuning their properties. It is widely known that extrinsic dopants impact the structure and stability of perovskite surfaces, but an atomic-scale view is missing. Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/PES) are used to combine microscopic and spectroscopic evidence of cobalt adsorption, incorporation, and clustering at surfaces of two prototypical perovskites SrTiO3 and KTaO3. A number of different sub-ML coverages and temperatures of annealing were investigated.
  Several common features are observed: cobalt shows a strong preference for ionic nature (+2 and +3 charge states), and remains dispersed as single atoms to a certain extent in both perovskites. Two competing mechanisms are observed upon annealing: coalescence into clusters with a mixed metallic/ionic character, and incorporation into the surface and subsurface regions. The latter is more pronounced in SrTiO3, where a cobalt-stabilized surface reconstruction is identified, whereas for KTaO3 cobalt likely incorporates in the near-surface region.</description>

      <title>Fracture initiation in silicate glasses via a universal shear localization mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear bands lie at the root of fracture initiation in bulk metallic glasses and amorphous polymers. For silicate glasses, in contrast, studies have largely emphasized permanent volumetric strain, commonly referred to as densification. Here we systematically investigate indentation-induced fracture in two distinct families of aluminoborosilicate glasses. The results demonstrate that plastic shear flow plays a decisive role in governing fracture initiation. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations reveal a pronounced composition dependence of softening associated with plastic shear flow, closely mirroring the experimentally observed propensity for strain localization. We conclude that silicate glasses conform to a universal pattern of rupture initiation governed by localization of shear-deformation, aligning with a broad range of amorphous materials, including bulk metallic glasses and glassy polymers.</description>

      <title>A Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Criterion for Metallic Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central unresolved question in the theory of superconductivity is why only a small subset of metallic elements exhibit a superconducting state, whereas many others remain strictly normal. Neither the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) framework nor its extensions involving charge density wave (CDW) or pair density wave (PDW) order provide a predictive or material-selective criterion capable of distinguishing superconducting metals from non-superconducting ones. In particular, the persistent absence of superconductivity in simple noble metals with well-defined Fermi surfaces poses a challenge for all traditional approaches. Here we address this problem using the Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Ginzburg Landau (GL) framework introduced in our previous work. In this formulation, a coarse-grained MEL charge field $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}(\mathbf{r})$ with momentum dependent stiffness $\alpha(q)$ is coupled to the superconducting (SC) order parameter $\psi(\mathbf{r})$. We show that metallic superconductivity emerges only when the system satisfies a specific ``MEL enhancement window,'' characterized by a negative minimum of $\alpha(q)$ at either a finite modulation wave vector $q^{\ast}$ or at $q=0$, together with sufficiently strong coupling between $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}$ and $\psi$. This unified criterion naturally partitions metallic elements into three universal classes: (i) MEL-enhanced superconductors with a finite-$q^{\ast}$ charge mode, (ii) conventional BCS superconductors as the homogeneous $q^{\ast}=0$ limit of the MEL framework, and (iii) metals for which $\alpha(q)$ remains positive for all $q$, suppressing all MEL modes and preventing any superconducting instability. By applying this criterion to simple metallic elements, we identify why some metals develop superconductivity while others do not, possibly resolving a selection problem long open within the BCS paradigm.</description>

Abstract: Recent research suggests the possibility of the two-dimensional breathing-Kagome magnet Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ hosting a quantum spin liquid state, warranting further study into its magnetic properties. Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f &gt; 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism. Although the elements have relatively small atomic numbers, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable in magnitude to the anisotropic exchange. Additionally, we show that biaxial strain tunes the short-range correlations between antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic. These findings strengthen our understanding of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ and advance its applications in current condensed matter physics and materials science research, including nanoscale mechanical and spintronics applications.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy of back-gated 2D semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2D field effect transistors the gate electrostatically dopes the 2D semiconductor (2DSC) channel, tuning the Fermi level. In principle, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) can detect the Fermi level, and its dependence on gate bias as well as position, potentially directly yielding band gaps, contact barriers, spatial nonuniformities, and sub-gap densities of states in such devices. However, KPFM relies on an oscillating probe voltage which itself electrostatically dopes the 2DSC, potentially creating a nonlinear response. Here, we show that when a suitably thin hBN back-gate dielectric is used, the KPFM signal agrees well with expectations, as explained by a quasistatic charge-balance model. Corresponding experimental results show excellent consistency with the literature values of the bandgaps of monolayer and trilayer WSe2. With this approach, the widely available technique of KPFM should find improved utility and new uses in the study of 2D devices.</description>

      <title>Dosimetry for Proton Therapy Using a \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Metal-Semiconductor-Metal Detector with Low-Noise Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) employs proton radiation rather than conventional X-rays to treat cancerous tumors. This approach offers significant advantages by minimizing the radiation exposure of surrounding healthy tissue, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced side effects compared to traditional X-ray therapy. To ensure patient safety, each treatment plan must be experimentally validated before clinical implementation. However, current dosimetry devices face limitations in performing angled beam measurements and obtaining multi-depth assessments, both of which are essential for verifying IMPT treatment plans. In this study, the performance of a \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) detector with a low-noise amplifier is studied and evaluated under various proton radiation doses and energy levels delivered by a MEVION S250i proton accelerator. The detector performance is also compared with that of an ionization chamber. The \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ detector exhibits a linear response with proton dose for single-spot irradiations, and its response to varying proton energies closely matches both the ion chamber data and simulated dose distributions. These findings highlight the potential of \beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based detectors as robust dosimetry devices for IMPT applications.</description>

      <title>Transient Pauli blocking in a InN film as a mechanism for broadband ultrafast optical switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transient Pauli blocking effect offers a promising route for achieving ultrafast optical switching in semiconductors, enabling a rapid switching from an initially opaque state to a relatively transparent state upon photoexcitation. Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\mathrm{mJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Physicochemical properties of lunar regolith simulant for in situ oxygen production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permanent lunar settlements will rely on in situ oxygen production from regolith for life support and propulsion. While oxygen is abundant in lunar materials, it is chemically bound within metal oxides whose extractability depends strongly on regolith composition and processing strategy. In this study, we validate and characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants representative of the lunar highlands and south pole using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore structure analysis, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. The simulants exhibit strong mineralogical and compositional fidelity to returned Apollo and Chang'e samples, with ilmenite confirmed as the most readily reducible oxygen-bearing phase. However, despite low ilmenite abundance, bulk highland simulants display favorable reduction behavior arising from distributed Fe-bearing silicate and glassy phases, as well as surface and microstructural properties that influence gas-solid interactions. Adsorption experiments with gases (H2, CH4, and CO2) and water indicate that mineralogical heterogeneity and pore accessibility influence their uptake in simulants. These results indicate that oxygen extraction behavior in realistic lunar regolith is governed by whole-regolith response rather than ilmenite content alone, supporting the option of whole-regolith processing strategies for oxygen production in lunar in situ resource utilization architectures.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-driven quarter semimetals in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semimetals exhibit intriguing characteristics attributed to the coexistence of both electrons and holes. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals.</description>

      <title>Coupled gas and bubble dynamics at the solidification front</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and entrapment of gas bubbles during solidification significantly influence the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials, from metallic alloys to ice. While gas segregation at the solidification front is well-documented, the real-time dynamics of bubble nucleation, growth, and engulfment-and their dependence on solidification velocity-remain poorly understood. In this study, we use in situ cryo-confocal fluorescence microscopy to investigate the coupled gas-bubble dynamics at the solidification front of carbonated water, systematically varying the solidification velocity ($V = 1-20 \mu m/s$) while maintaining a constant thermal gradient ($G = 15 K/mm$). Our experiments reveal that bubble nucleation is governed by a characteristic nucleation time, which emerges from the interplay between gas diffusion ahead of the front, nucleation kinetics, and bubble growth, all competing with the advancing solidification front. These results allow us to estimate the critical gas concentration for bubbles nucleation in carbonated water. These results offer a detailed understanding of the mechanisms controlling bubble nucleation and entrapment during solidification at constant thermal gradient. They contribute to the development of strategies to control bubble formation in industrial processes where the presence of bubbles can either be detrimental or intentionally harnessed.</description>

      <title>Broken intrinsic symmetry induced magnon-magnon coupling in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets offer rich magnon energy spectra in which optical and acoustic magnon branches can hybridize. Here, we demonstrate a broken intrinsic symmetry induced coupling of acoustic and optical magnons in a synthetic ferrimagnet consisting of two dissimilar antiferromagnetically interacting ferromagnetic metals. Two distinct magnon modes hybridize at degeneracy points, as indicated by an avoided level-crossing. The avoided level-crossing gap depends on the interlayer exchange interaction between the magnetic layers, which can be controlled by adjusting the non-magnetic interlayer thickness. A large avoided level crossing gap of 3.9 GHz is revealed, exceeding the coupling strength that is typically found in other magnonic hybrid systems based on a coupling of magnons with photons or magnons with phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal, mechanical, and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is governed by their low-energy phonons, yet the impact of atomic-scale disorder on these modes remains poorly understood. Here, we report the first measurement of acoustic phonon dispersions in a quasi-freestanding monolayer semiconductor (MoS2), using helium-3 spin-echo spectroscopy. We identify a defect-driven regime change at a critical wavevector, $q_c$, marking the breakdown of continuum elastic behavior. At this length scale, the flexural mode transitions from continuum bending to defect-pinned standing waves, while the hybridized Rayleigh wave becomes vibrationally disordered in its dispersion and linewidth. We observe multiple defect-induced Van Hove singularities deep within the Brillouin zone and strongly suppressed acoustic group velocities, providing direct experimental evidence that four-phonon processes drive thermal transport in mono- and few-layer MoS2. These results offer a microscopic explanation for the anomalously low thermal conductivity widely observed in transition-metal dichalcogenides and demonstrate how atomic-scale disorder dictates energy flow in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before assessing the suitability of a semiconductor for specific applications, the first question to ask is whether it possesses a direct or indirect band gap. This distinction is fundamental, as the operation of devices such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and photodetectors is closely tied to the band-gap nature. Semiconductors that exhibit a band-gap crossover, from indirect to direct or vice versa, offer enhanced versatility for optoelectronic applications. Prominent examples include transition metal dichalcogenides and the subject of this study, PbI2. The nature of the band gap, and its crossover, can only be directly determined in reciprocal space by tracking the valence-band maximum and conduction-band minimum. Here, we directly visualize the thickness-dependent crossover of PbI2 from an indirect to a direct band gap using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our measurements reveal a shift of the valence-band maximum toward the Brillouin-zone center as the film thickness exceeds a monolayer. Supported by density functional theory calculations, our results show that this crossover is driven by interlayer interactions and the hybridization of iodine pz orbitals. These findings demonstrate the tunable electronic structure of PbI2 and its potential for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>First-principle investigation of the electronic structure and optical properties of graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic and optical properties of lateral heterostructures made of alternated armchair ribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. It is known that the gapwidth of these heterostructures can be classified into three families depending on the width of the graphene part. Here, by employing ab initio methods (standard and time-dependent density functional theory and GW), we demonstrate that such classification still holds for other electronic states close to the gap. We show that they display trends substantially different from those known for the gapwidth and originate family-specific features in the screening properties and optical absorption spectra (peak energy and intensity). In addition, our use of a tight binding model originally introduced for isolated nanoribbons allows us to discuss some crucial heterostructure's properties in view of those of its isolated building blocks, including charge redistribution at the edges, gap hierarchy inversion, and specific optical selection rules. By bridging the electronic structure to optical absorption spectra in a comprehensive set of systems, this study sets the stage for more refined investigations on the absorption properties of graphene/boron nitride lateral heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium (Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} studies of influence of periodic-direction electric fields on spin lifetime and spin diffusion length and the validation of an \textit{ab initio} matrix-drift-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we developed an \textit{ab initio} approach of spin lifetime (\tau_{s}) and spin diffusion length (l_{s}) in solids [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046705 (2025)], based on a density-matrix master equation with quantum treatment of electron scattering processes. In this work, we extend the method to include the drift term due to an electric field along a periodic direction, implemented using a Wannier-representation-based covariant derivative. We employ this approach to investigate the electric-field effect on \tau_{s} and l_{s} of monolayer WSe_{2}, bulk GaAs, bulk GaN, and graphene-h-BN heterostructure. We find that an electric field reduces \tau_{s} of GaAs, due to the induced D'yakonov-Perel'-type spin relaxation. In GaN and graphene-h-BN, \tau_{s} is significantly affected, partly because the electric field generates an effective magnetic field corresponding to the k-derivative of Rashba spin-orbit (magnetic) field. Our results show that l_{s} can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by a moderate downstream or upstream field respectively. While the standard drift-diffusion model performs well for WSe_{2}, it can introduce large errors of the electric-field-induced changes of l_{s} in GaAs, GaN and graphene-h-BN. Our proposed \textit{ab initio} matrix-drift-diffusion model improves results for GaAs and GaN, but still fails for graphene-h-BN. Thus, to accurately capture the influence of electric fields on l_{s} in realistic materials, it is necessary to go beyond the drift-diffusion model and adopt a microscopic \textit{ab initio} methodology. Moreover, in graphene-h-BN, we find that the field-induced changes of \tau_{s} and l_{s} are not only governed by the drift term in the master equation, but are also significantly affected by the electric-field modification of the equilibrium density matrix away from Fermi-Dirac distribution function.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</description>

      <title>Significant surface-mediated reduction of radiation damage in tungsten revealed by advanced ion channeling analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tungsten is a leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrochemical systems are important for a sustainable and defossilized energy system of the future. While accurate and precise, the corresponding electrochemical measurements, in which many reactions may occur simultaneously, often do not contain enough information to understand the underlying mechanism and processes. This information, however, is crucial towards rational materials and devices as well as process development and for inventing new concepts. We introduce explicitly the concept of "X-ray Coulomb Counting" in which X-ray methods are used to quantify on an absolute scale how much charge is transferred into which reactions during the electrochemical measurements. This allows to interpret the electrochemical measurements in detail and obtain the desired phenomenological and mechanistic understanding. We show a few recent examples from the Li-ion battery literature in which the concept of X-ray Coulomb Counting was employed to obtain foundational understanding.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic structures, which play a central role in determining their physical properties, are known for only very limited compounds. Traditional theoretical approaches to predicting magnetic structures predominantly rely on first-principles calculations. A key challenge of these methods is their requirement for initial magnetic configurations as inputs, which theoretically possess infinite possibilities. In this work, we introduce a strategy based on irreducible representation basis vectors that effectively narrows down the vast space of potential magnetic configurations to a finite set, typically comprising around 20 candidates per material. Despite this significant reduction, the compact input sets generated by our method already encompass the experimental magnetic structures for 253 out of 302 benchmark materials (83.8%) from the MAGNDATA database. These materials have propagation vectors q=0 and unit cells containing up to 40 atoms, all within the Landau framework. Subsequent first-principles calculations correctly identify the magnetic structure in 198 of these cases. We further apply our highly efficient method to 8,422 stoichiometric transition-metal compounds with fewer than 30 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, and establish a magnetic structure database containing 2,906 magnetic materials. To demonstrate its utility, we use this database for the systematic exploration of magnetic topological phases and altermagnets, identifying 1,070 and 392 candidate materials, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Nanoribbons for High-Performance Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.</description>

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real and imaginary parts define the quantum metric and Berry curvature, encodes the intrinsic geometry of quantum states. While electronic QGT has been directly observed and linked to various phenomena like electron-phonon coupling, its bosonic analogue remains both theoretically and experimentally unexplored. We demonstrate that the dynamical structure factor directly encodes the full QGT throughout the Brillouin zone, establishing it as a sensitive probe of both quantum metric and Berry curvature. Applying this framework, we uncover clear geometric signatures in a twofold quadruple Weyl phonon in BaPtGe and the node-line magnon in Gd. Our results establish a general, direct route to measuring quantum geometry in bosonic systems, a crucial step toward elucidating its impact on condensed matter phenomena.</description>

      <title>Resolving Overlapping EBSD Patterns by Experiment -- Simulation Residuals Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.</description>

      <title>Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical model for wire rolling is developed, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations, assuming a rigid, perfectly plastic material and exploiting the thinness of the wire (in thickness and width) relative to the roller size. Results are compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using 100mm diameter rolls, demonstrating accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. Since the model requires only seconds to compute, the model's valid range is explored for varying roll diameter, wire diameter, and reduction ratio, and their effects on the resulting lateral spread characterized. The model can serve as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models. Matlab code to evaluate the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.</description>

      <title>Language-Native Materials Processing Design by Lightly Structured Text Database and Reasoning Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials synthesis procedures are predominantly documented as narrative text in protocols and lab notebooks, rendering them inaccessible to conventional structured data optimization. This language-native nature poses a critical challenge for complex, multistage processes--such as the preparation of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS)--where outcomes depend on path-dependent choices in exfoliation and functionalization. Here, we recast synthesis planning as a text reasoning task enabled by a lightly structured text database, which preserves the conditional logic and causal contexts essential for expert-like decision-making. Building on a heterogeneous schema that indexes both narrative excerpts and computable entities (e.g., reaction conditions), our system implements a hybrid retrieval engine to combine semantic context with precise parameter filtering. On top of this, the framework operates in two modes, i.e. retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which grounds recommendations in retrieved evidence modules, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which uses iteratively refined text guides distilled from multi-source narrative data. Instead of suggesting single "optimal" settings, the system produces interpretable guidance aligned with expert reasoning patterns--hypotheses, parameter ranges, and citation-backed standard operating procedures--that support iterative planning and failure diagnosis. We validated this framework on the targeted exfoliation of BNNS, a process highly sensitive to multivariate constraints. The system successfully identified optimal combinations of grinding aids, milling configurations, and separation strategies from a wide range of literature-reported methods, which were experimentally verified to yield high-quality nanosheets, illustrating the potential of language-native reasoning to streamline critical operations in materials processing.</description>
