      <title>Connections between hyperlinearity, stability and character rigidity for higher rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be an irreducible lattice in a semisimple Lie group of real rank at least $2$. Suppose that $\Gamma$ has property (T;FD), that is, its finite dimensional representations have a uniform spectral gap. We show that if $\Gamma$ is (flexibly) Hilbert--Schmidt stable then: $(a)$ infinite central extensions $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of $\Gamma$ are not hyperlinear, and $(b)$ every character of $\Gamma$ is either finite-dimensional or induced from the center (character rigidity). As a consequence, a positive answer to the following question would yield an explicit example of a non-hyperlinear group: If two representations of the modular group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ almost agree on a specific congruence subgroup $H$ under a commensuration, must they be close to representations that genuinely agree on $H$?</description>

      <title>Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Along Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the equivalence between exponential decay of the relative entropy along a quantum Markov semigroup and the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for general von Neumann algebras. We also extend an intertwining criterion for the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality to GNS-symmetric quantum Markov semigroups on infinite-dimensional von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Real Non-Commutative Convexity I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convex sets, the real case of the recent and profound complex theory developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their profound memoir. Later results will be discussed in a future paper. We develop some of the infrastructure of real nc convexity, giving many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated nc convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>

      <title>The Graded Classification Conjecture holds for graphs with disjoint cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Graded Classification Conjecture (GCC) states that the pointed $K_0^{\operatorname{gr}}$-group is a complete invariant of the Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs when these algebras are considered with their natural grading by $\mathbb Z.$ The conjecture has previously been shown to hold in some special cases. The main result of the paper shows that the GCC holds for a significantly more general class of graphs included in the class of graphs with disjoint cycles. In particular, our result holds for finite graphs with disjoint cycles. We show the main result also for graph $C^*$-algebras. As a consequence, the graded version of the Isomorphism Conjecture holds for the class of graphs we consider.
  Besides showing the conjecture for the class of graphs we consider, we realize the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-group isomorphism by a specific graded $*$-isomorphism. In particular, we introduce a series of graph operations which preserve the graded $*$-isomorphism class of their algebras. After performing these operations on a graph, we obtain well-behaved ``representative'' graphs, which we call canonical forms. We define an equivalence $\approx$ on graphs such that $E\approx F$ holds when there are isomorphic canonical forms of $E$ and $F$ and we show that the condition $E\approx F$ is equivalent to the existence of an isomorphism $f$ of the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-groups of the algebras of $E$ and $F$ in the appropriate category. As $E\approx F$ can be realized by a finite series of specific graph operations, any such isomorphism $f$ can be realized by an explicit graded $*$-algebra isomorphism. Thus, we describe the graded ($*$-)isomorphism classes of the algebras of graphs we consider. Besides the ties to symbolic dynamics and Williams' Problem, such a description is relevant for the active program of classification of graph $C^*$-algebras.</description>
