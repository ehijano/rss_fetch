      <title>Time-resolved pairing gap spectroscopy in a quantum simulator of fermionic superfluidity inside an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an ensemble of laser-cooled strontium atoms in a high-finesse cavity to cleanly emulate the technique of rf spectroscopy employed in studies of BEC-BCS physics in fermionic superfluids of degenerate cold gases. Here, we leverage the multilevel internal structure of the atoms to study the physics of Cooper pair breaking in this system. In doing so, we observe and distinguish the properties of two distinct many-body gaps, the BCS pairing gap and the spectral gap, using nondestructive readout techniques. The latter is found to depend on the populations of the internal atomic states, reflecting the chemical potential dependence predicted in fermionic superfluids. This work opens the path for more fully exploiting the rich internal structure of atoms in cavity QED emulators to study both analogous systems and also more exotic states yet to be realized.</description>

      <title>Shape-induced Bose-Einstein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in flat-bottomed optical box traps have enabled the realization of homogeneous Bose gases, allowing for the exploration of Bose-Einstein condensation in more complex confinement geometries. Here we propose a shape-induced Bose-Einstein condensation at fixed size, temperature, and density. We investigate the impact of quantum shape effects on a non-interacting Bose gas confined within nested square domains, where the shape parameter is defined and controlled by the rotation angle between the inner and outer squares. The size-invariant shape transformation significantly affects the condensate fraction and specific heat of the system. Our work opens new avenues for controlling quantum systems through geometric manipulation, providing insights into the thermodynamic properties of Bose gases under shape-induced quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Stable 3D vortex solitons of high topological charge in a Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable vortex solitons (VSs) are objects of great interest for fundamental studies and various applications, including particle trapping, microscopy, data encoding, and matter-wave gyroscopes. However, three-dimensional (3D) VSs with high topological charges, supported by self-attractive nonlinearities, are unstable against fragmentation, which eventually leads to internal blowup (supercritical collapse) of the fragments. Here, we propose a scheme for realizing stable 3D VSs with topological charges up to $5$ and $6$ in the two components of a binary, Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We show that, if the SOC strength exceeds a critical value, the rotational symmetry of the VSs in the transverse plane gets broken, resulting in separation of the two components. Nevertheless, the VSs with the broken symmetry remain stable. The VS stability domains are identified in the system's parameter space. Moreover, application of torque to the stable VSs sets them in the state of robust gyroscopic precession.</description>

      <title>Third quantization with Hartree approximation for open-system bosonic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third quantization (3rd Q) for bosons provides the exact steady-state solution of the Lindblad equation with quadratic Hamiltonians. By decomposing the interaction of the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree approximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the open-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady state. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite Fock space of bosons while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the system size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM, including the uniform chain, interaction induced diode effect, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations with capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of the steady-state value. Thus, the manageable 3rd Q with Hartree approximation allows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum transport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing topological entanglement on large scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically ordered quantum matter exhibits intriguing long-range patterns of entanglement, which reveal themselves in subsystem entropies. However, measuring such entropies, which can be used to certify topological order, on large partitions is challenging and becomes practically unfeasible for large systems. We propose a protocol based on local adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian which extracts the universal features of long-range topological entanglement from measurements on small subsystems of finite size, trading an exponential number of measurements against a polynomial-time evolution. Our protocol is general and readily applicable to various quantum simulation architectures. We apply our method to various string-net models representing both abelian and non-abelian topologically ordered phases, and illustrate its application to neutral atom tweezer arrays with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and elementary excitations of strongly interacting droplets with non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-dimensional bosonic gas with strong contact repulsion and attractive non-local interactions may form a quantum droplet with a flat-top density profile. We focus on a system in the Tonks-Girardeau limit of infinitely strong contact repulsion. We show that the main system features are the same for a broad class of non-local interaction potentials. Then, we focus on a limiting case, the one of slowly varying density profiles, to find approximate formulas for the surface and bulk energies of a droplet. We further characterise the system by numerically finding the excitation spectrum. It consists of two families: phononic-like excitations inside droplets and scattering modes. Analysis within the linearised regime is supplemented with the full, nonlinear dynamics of small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz</title>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two $\delta$-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio $3\!:\!1$ in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is \emph{Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz} (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a $\delta$-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock interferometry using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>
