      <title>Identifying ballistic modes via Poincar\'e sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring chaotic systems via Poincar\'e sections has proven essential in dynamical systems, yet measuring their characteristics poses challenges to identify the various dynamical regimes considered. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses image processing to distinguish chaotic and regular regions of area-preserving dynamics, and then classify the transport regime. We characterize different transport regimes in the standard map with the proposed method based on image reconstruction techniques, identifying the superdiffusion much faster than the usual mean square displacement method. The procedure is also applied to a two-wave, time-dependent Hamiltonian to investigate superdiffusion in function of two parameters.</description>

      <title>Twisting vortex lines regularize Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid flows are intrinsically characterized via the topology and dynamics of underlying vortex lines. Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity.</description>

      <title>How we simulate DNA origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA origami consists of a long scaffold strand and short staple strands that self-assemble into a target 2D or 3D shape. It is a widely used construct in nucleic acid nanotechnology, offering a cost-effective way to design and create diverse nanoscale shapes. With promising applications in areas such as nanofabrication, diagnostics, and therapeutics, DNA origami has become a key tool in the bionanotechnology field. Simulations of these structures can offer insight into their shape and function, thus speeding up and simplifying the design process. However, simulating these structures, often comprising thousands of base pairs, poses challenges due to their large size. OxDNA, a coarse-grained model specifically designed for DNA nanotechnology, offers powerful simulation capabilities. Its associated ecosystem of visualization and analysis tools can complement experimental work with in silico characterization. This tutorial provides a general approach to simulating DNA origami structures using the oxDNA ecosystem, tailored for experimentalists looking to integrate computational analysis into their design workflow.</description>

      <title>Local Exchange-Correlation Potentials by Density Inversion in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.</description>

      <title>Relativistic beam loading, recoil-reduction, and residual-wake acceleration with a covariant retarded-potential integrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algorithm is demonstrated that performs first-principles tracking of relativistic charged-particles. A covariant approach is used which relies on retarded vector potentials for trajectory integration instead of performing electromagnetic field calculations. When accounting for retardation effects, the peak vector potential and corresponding Lorentz force in the direction of travel increase asymptotically for high-$\beta$ particles. This produces a very strong field distribution at small angles from the particle's direction of travel, which can result in considerable change in momentum when approaching a conducting surface or another charged particle. We quantify the former effect for protons and electrons at various energies and aperture sizes, where substantial power deposition can be avoided by ensuring that particles do not pass within roughly 10 microns of the aperture surface.
  We also simulate breaking a test particle's line of sight with a conductor or other charged body. After this instant, the test particle continues to accelerate due to residual fields, but no longer produces an opposing force on any charged or conducting object; thus any recoil on the enclosing structure is effectively reduced.
  Resulting acceleration dynamics are characterized using protons and electrons at various energies; with, for example, a 1% energy gain for an 85 MeV electron traversing its reflected wake while approaching a pinhole aperture. We then integrate a micro-scale dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) device into our simulations: compared with a solitary 2 mm DLA, we find a factor of two increase in energy gain when combining the DLA with a series of conducting-surface choppers.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional spin transport in altermagnetic $Z^3$ nodal net metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In three dimensions, quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport has traditionally been associated with systems featuring a Q1D chain structure. Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond this understanding to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in certain three-dimensional (3D) altermagnetic (AM) metals with a topological nodal net in momentum space but lacking Q1D chain structure in real space, including the existing compounds $\beta$-Fe$_2$(PO$_4$)O, Co$_2$(PO$_4$)O, and LiTi$_2$O$_4$. These materials exhibit an AM ground state and feature an ideal crossed $Z^3$ Weyl nodal line in each spin channel around Fermi level, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the entire Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AM $Z^3$ nodal net. Surprisingly, the electronic conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ in the up-spin channel, while $\sigma_{yy}$ dominates transport in the down-spin channel. This suggests a distinctive Q1D transport signature in each spin channel, and the principal moving directions for the two spin channels are orthogonal, resulting in Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon cannot be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials. In particular, the Q1D spin transport gradually disappears as the Fermi energy moves away from the nodal net, further confirming its topological origin. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in altermagnets but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>An improved penalty-based excited-state variational Monte Carlo approach with deep-learning ansatzes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce several improvements to the penalty-based variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm for computing electronic excited states of Entwistle $\textit{et al.}$ [M. T. Entwistle $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Commun. $\textbf{14}$, 274 (2023)], and demonstrate that the accuracy of the updated method is competitive with other available excited-state VMC approaches. A theoretical comparison of the computational aspects of these algorithms is presented, where several benefits of the penalty-based method are identified. Our main contributions include an automatic mechanism for tuning the scale of the penalty terms, an updated form of the overlap penalty with proven convergence properties, and a new term that penalizes the spin of the wave function, enabling the selective computation of states with a given spin. With these improvements, along with the use of the latest self-attention-based ansatz, the penalty-based method achieves a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol for the vertical excitation energies of a set of 26 atoms and molecules, without relying on variance matching schemes. Considering excited states along the dissociation of the carbon dimer, the accuracy of the penalty-based method is on par with that of natural-excited-state (NES) VMC, while also providing results for larger sections of the potential energy surface. Additionally, the accuracy of the original penalty-based method is improved for a conical intersection of ethylene, with the predicted angle of the intersection agreeing well with both NES-VMC and multi-reference configuration interaction.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Computing virtual dark-field X-ray microscopy images of complex discrete dislocation structures from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>
