      <title>DrugPilot: LLM-based Parameterized Reasoning Agent for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of AI4Science, large-scale language models (LLMs) show great potential to parse complex scientific semantics, integrate cross-disciplinary knowledge, and assist critical task research. However, in the field of drug discovery, despite the optimization through professional data pre-training, context window expansion, and internet search, the existing LLMs are still facing challenges such as massive multi-modal and heterogeneous data processing, domain knowledge dynamic updating delay, and insufficient confidence in predicting the results of complex computational tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the DrugPilot, an LLM-based agent with parameterized reasoning for drug discovery. DrugPilot addresses key limitations of traditional end-to-end LLM prediction approaches through its parametric inference architecture. This agent system supports major phases of the drug discovery pipeline, facilitating automated planning and execution of multi-stage research tasks. To address the critical challenge of multi-modal drug data analysis (incorporating both public datasets and user-submitted data), we developed an interactive parameterized memory pool. This innovative component standardizes real-world drug data into parametric representations, simultaneously enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in multi-turn dialogue while mitigating the information loss inherent in text-based data transmission. Additionally, we created a drug instruct dataset across 8 essential drug discovery tasks for model fine-tuning and evaluation. Based on the Berkeley function calling evaluation framework, DrugPilot demonstrated the most advanced tool calling capabilities on our drug discovery tool instruction dataset, outperforming existing agents (e.g., ReAct, LoT). Specifically, it achieves task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% on simple, multiple, and multi-turn tasks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, \textit{i.e.}, the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a simple model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Our results underscore the necessity of sufficient heterogeneity in the mutational effects selected by evolution for the emergence of functional bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that the model agrees with experimental findings, at least in small enough combinatorial mutational spaces.</description>

      <title>Hotspot-Driven Peptide Design via Multi-Fragment Autoregressive Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt valid geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic tasks for peptide drug development are still lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce PepHAR, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring correct peptide structures. By combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables de novo peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of PepHAR in computational peptide binder design. Source code will be available at https://github.com/Ced3-han/PepHAR.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning for de novo Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning a pre-trained generative model has demonstrated good performance in generating promising drug molecules. The fine-tuning task is often formulated as a reinforcement learning problem, where previous methods efficiently learn to optimize a reward function to generate potential drug molecules. Nevertheless, in the absence of an adaptive update mechanism for the reward function, the optimization process can become stuck in local optima. The efficacy of the optimal molecule in a local optimization may not translate to usefulness in the subsequent drug optimization process or as a potential standalone clinical candidate. Therefore, it is important to generate a diverse set of promising molecules. Prior work has modified the reward function by penalizing structurally similar molecules, primarily focusing on finding molecules with higher rewards. To date, no study has comprehensively examined how different adaptive update mechanisms for the reward function influence the diversity of generated molecules. In this work, we investigate a wide range of intrinsic motivation methods and strategies to penalize the extrinsic reward, and how they affect the diversity of the set of generated molecules. Our experiments reveal that combining structure- and prediction-based methods generally yields better results in terms of diversity.</description>

      <title>Predicting Heteropolymer Phase Separation Using Two-Chain Contact Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in polymer solutions often correlates with single-chain and two-chain properties, such as the single-chain radius of gyration, Rg, and the pairwise second virial coefficient, B22. However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can fail to distinguish phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase separation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture how often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity. Whereas B22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps preserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these metrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer model and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple statistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with high accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on Rg and B22 alone. Our results thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to uncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical interactions in dilute solution.</description>
