      <title>Plane stress finite element modelling of arbitrary compressible hyperelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the large deformation of hyperelastic solids under plane stress conditions for arbitrary compressible and nearly incompressible material models is challenging. This is in contrast to the case of full incompressibility where the out-of-plane deformation can be entirely characterised by the in-plane components. A rigorous general procedure for the incorporation of the plane stress condition for the compressible case (including the nearly incompressible case) is provided here, accompanied by a robust and open source finite element code. An isochoric/volumetric decomposition is adopted for nearly incompressible materials yielding a robust single-field finite element formulation. The nonlinear equation for the out-of-plane component of the deformation gradient is solved using a Newton-Raphson procedure nested at the quadrature point level. The model's performance and accuracy are made clear via a series of simulations of benchmark problems. Additional challenging numerical examples of composites reinforced with particles and fibres further demonstrate the capability of this general computational framework.</description>

      <title>An optimal parallel-in-time preconditioner for parabolic optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel diagonalization-based preconditioner for the all-at-once linear system arising from the optimal control problem of parabolic equations. The proposed preconditioner is constructed based on an $\epsilon$-circulant modification to the rotated block diagonal (RBD) preconditioning technique, which can be efficiently diagonalized by fast Fourier transforms in a parallel-in-time fashion. \textcolor{black}{To our knowledge, this marks the first application of the $\epsilon$-circulant modification to RBD preconditioning. Before our work, the studies of PinT preconditioning techniques for the optimal control problem are mainly focused on $\epsilon$-circulant modification to Schur complement based preconditioners, which involves multiplication of forward and backward evolutionary processes and thus square the condition number. Compared with those Schur complement based preconditioning techniques in the literature, the advantage of the proposed $\epsilon$-circulant modified RBD preconditioning is that it does not involve the multiplication of forward and backward evolutionary processes. When the generalized minimal residual method is deployed on the preconditioned system, we prove that when choosing $\epsilon=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\tau})$ with $\tau$ being the temporal step-size , the convergence rate of the preconditioned GMRES solver is independent of the matrix size and the regularization parameter. Such restriction on $\epsilon$ is more relax than the assumptions on $\epsilon$ from other works related to $\epsilon$-circulant based preconditioning techniques for the optimal control problem. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solvers.</description>

      <title>Mapped Hermite Functions and their applications to two-dimensional weakly singular Fredholm-Hammerstein integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fredholm-Hammerstein integral equations (FHIEs) with weakly singular kernels exhibit multi-point singularity at the endpoints or boundaries. The dense discretized matrices result in high computational complexity when employing numerical methods. To address this, we propose a novel class of mapped Hermite functions, which are constructed by applying a mapping to Hermite polynomials.We establish fundamental approximation theory for the orthogonal functions. We propose MHFs-spectral collocation method and MHFs-smoothing transformation method to solve the two-point weakly singular FHIEs, respectively. Error analysis and numerical results demonstrate that our methods, based on the new orthogonal functions, are particularly effective for handling problems with weak singularities at two endpoints, yielding exponential convergence rate. We position this work as the first to directly study the mapped spectral method for multi-point singularity problems, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>The Reconstruction of the Space-Dependent Thermal Conductivity from Sparse Temperature Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for reconstructing the thermal conductivity coefficient in 1D and 2D heat equations using moving sensors that dynamically traverse the domain to record sparse and noisy temperature measurements. We significantly reduce the computational cost associated with forward PDE evaluations by employing automatic differentiation, enabling a more efficient and scalable reconstruction process. This allows the inverse problem to be solved with fewer sensors and observations. Specifically, we demonstrate the successful reconstruction of thermal conductivity on the 1D circle and 2D torus, using one and four moving sensors, respectively, with their positions recorded over time. Our method incorporates sampling algorithms to compute confidence intervals for the reconstructed conductivity, improving robustness against measurement noise. Extensive numerical simulations of heat dynamics validate the efficacy of our approach, confirming both the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed thermal conductivity. Additionally, the method is thoroughly tested using large datasets from machine learning, allowing us to evaluate its performance across various scenarios and ensure its reliability. This approach provides a cost-effective and flexible solution for conductivity reconstruction from sparse measurements, making it a robust tool for solving inverse problems in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Coupling deal.II and FROSch: A Sustainable and Accessible (O)RAS Preconditioner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) and optimized restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) preconditioners from the Trilinos package FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) are employed to solve model problems implemented using deal.II (differential equations analysis library). Therefore, a Tpetra-based interface for coupling deal.II and FROSch is implemented. While RAS preconditioners have been available before, ORAS preconditioners have been newly added to FROSch. The FROSch-deal.II interface works for both Lagrange-based and N\'ed\'elec finite elements. Here, as model problems, nonstationary, nonlinear, variational-monolithic fluid-structure interaction and the indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell's equations are considered. Several numerical experiments in two and three spatial dimensions confirm the performance of the preconditioners as well as the FROSch-deal.II interface. In conclusion, the overall software interface is straightforward and easy to use while giving satisfactory solver performances for challenging PDE systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarise three applications of the obstacle problem to membrane contact, elastoplastic torsion and cavitation modelling, and show how the resulting models can be solved using mixed finite elements. It is challenging to construct fixed computational meshes for any inequality-constrained problem because the coincidence set has an unknown shape. Consequently, we demonstrate how $h$-adaptivity can be used to resolve the unknown coincidence set. We demonstrate some practical challenges that must be overcome in the application of the adaptive method.</description>

      <title>Learned RESESOP for solving inverse problems with inexact forward operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving inverse problems, one has to deal with numerous potential sources of model inexactnesses, like object motion, calibration errors, or simplified data models. Regularized Sequential Subspace Optimization (ReSeSOp) allows to compensate for such inaccuracies within the reconstruction step by employing consecutive projections onto suitably defined subspaces. However, this approach relies on a priori estimates for the model inexactness levels which are typically unknown. In dynamic imaging applications, where inaccuracies arise from the unpredictable dynamics of the object, these estimates are particularly challenging to determine in advance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a learned version of ReSeSOp which allows to approximate inexactness levels on the fly. The proposed framework generalizes established unrolled iterative reconstruction schemes to inexact forward operators and is particularly tailored to the structure of dynamic problems. We also present a comprehensive mathematical analysis regarding the effect of dependencies within the forward problem, clarifying when and why dividing the overall problem into subproblems is essential. The proposed method is evaluated on various examples from dynamic imaging, including datasets from a rheological CT experiment, brain MRI, and real-time cardiac MRI. The respective results emphasize improvements in reconstruction quality while ensuring adequate data consistency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study approximation of the embedding $\ell_p^m \hookrightarrow \ell_q^m$, $1 \leq p &lt; q \leq \infty$, based on randomized algorithms that use up to $n$ arbitrary linear functionals as information on a problem instance where $n \ll m$. By analysing adaptive methods we show upper bounds for which the information-based complexity $n$ exhibits only a $(\log\log m)$-dependence. In the case $q &lt; \infty$ we use a multi-sensitivity approach in order to reach optimal polynomial order in $n$ for the Monte Carlo error. We also improve on non-adaptive methods for $q &lt; \infty$ by denoising known algorithms for uniform approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of symplectic resonance based schemes for Schr\"odinger's equation in dimension one, building on the work in [1] wherein resonance based numerical schemes were developed in the context of dispersive PDE driven by time dependent, or space-time dependent, coloured noise. We work primarily with a cubic nonlinearity, advancing the approach introduced in [15] for deriving symplectic schemes in the deterministic setting. As an example of such a scheme we derive the resonance based midpoint rule for the Stochastic NLS and analyse its convergence properties.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for Deep Learning-based Uncertainty Propagation in SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF using existing methods. The main contribution is the analysis of the approximation error: we develop a theory to construct an arbitrary tight error bound with PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with existing training methods. Finally, we explain that this error-bound theory generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Several numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>An eikonal model with re-excitability for fast simulations in cardiac electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision cardiology based on cardiac digital twins requires accurate simulations of cardiac arrhythmias. However, detailed models, such as the monodomain model, are computationally costly and have limited applicability in practice. Thus, it desirable to have fast models that can still represent the main physiological features presented during cardiac arrhythmias. The eikonal model is an approximation of the monodomain model that is widely used to describe the arrival times of the electrical wave. However, the standard eikonal model does not generalize to the complex re-entrant dynamics that characterize the cardiac arrhythmias. In this work, we propose an eikonal model that includes the tissue re-excitability, which allows to describe re-entries. The re-excitability properties are inferred from the monodomain model. Our eikonal model also handles the tissue anisotropy and heterogeneity. We compare the eikonal model to the monodomain model in various numerical experiments in the atria and the ventricles. The eikonal model is qualitatively accurate in the simulation of re-entries and can be potentially ran in real-time, opening the door to its clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>A physics-aware data-driven surrogate approach for fast atmospheric radiative transfer inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) was selected in 2019 as the ninth Earth Explorer mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). Its primary objective is to collect interferometric measurements in the Far-InfraRed (FIR) spectral range, which accounts for 50\% of Earth's outgoing longwave radiation emitted into space, and will be observed from space for the first time. Accurate measurements of the FIR at the top of the atmosphere are crucial for improving climate models. Current instruments are insufficient, necessitating the development of advanced computational techniques. To ensure the quality of the mission data, an End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was developed to simulate the measurement process and evaluate the effects of instrument characteristics and environmental factors. The core challenge of the mission is solving the retrieval problem, which involves estimating atmospheric properties from the radiance spectra observed by the satellite. This problem is ill-posed and regularization techniques are necessary. In this work, we present a novel and fast data-driven approach to approximate the inverse mapping. In the first phase, we generate an initial approximation of the inverse mapping using only simulated FORUM data. In the second phase, we improve this approximation by introducing climatological data as a priori information and using a neural network to estimate the optimal regularization parameters. While our approach does not match the precision of full-physics retrieval methods, its key advantage is the ability to deliver results almost instantaneously, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide more accurate a priori estimates for full-physics methods, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the retrieved atmospheric profiles.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Expansion Phase Field Crystal (APFC) Modeling based Efficient Dislocation Simulations using Fourier Pseudospectral Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline defects play a critical role in determining the properties of crystalline solids, underscoring the need for accurate computational methods to study them. Lattice deformation in dislocation simulations, which involves changes in atomic positions, can be described either microscopically by specific atomic configurations or macroscopically by continuum elasticity, each with inherent limitations. The complex amplitude expansion of the phase field crystal (APFC) model provides a mesoscopic approach that bridges these scales. In this paper, we introduce a Fourier pseudospectral method for efficiently solving the APFC model in the context of crystalline defect simulations. This study marks the first application of the Fourier pseudospectral method to the APFC model. The method fully exploits the system's periodicity and facilitates the implementation of periodic boundary conditions, thanks to its high accuracy and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments conducted on two-dimensional triangular lattices and three-dimensional body-centered cubic lattices for edge dislocation geometry optimization have produced strain field images that align well with by continuum elasticity predictions. The findings demonstrate the potential of the APFC model to accurately capture the complex strain fields associated with dislocations at the mesoscopic scales, a key step toward modeling more intricate crystalline defect structures and dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an implementable, neural network-based structure preserving probabilistic numerical approximation for a generalized obstacle problem describing the value of a zero-sum differential game of optimal stopping with asymmetric information. The target solution depends on three variables: the time, the spatial (or state) variable, and a variable from a standard $(I-1)$-simplex which represents the probabilities with which the $I$ possible configurations of the game are played. The proposed numerical approximation preserves the convexity of the continuous solution as well as the lower and upper obstacle bounds. We show convergence of the fully-discrete scheme to the unique viscosity solution of the continuous problem and present a range of numerical studies to demonstrate its applicability.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric and Positivity Preserving Formulation of a Spectral Method for Vlasov-Poisson Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the anti-symmetric properties of a spectral discretization for the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations. The discretization is based on a spectral expansion in velocity with the symmetrically weighted Hermite basis functions, central finite differencing in space, and an implicit Runge Kutta integrator in time. The proposed discretization preserves the anti-symmetric structure of the advection operator in the Vlasov equation, resulting in a stable numerical method. We apply such discretization to two formulations: the canonical Vlasov-Poisson equations and their continuously transformed square-root representation. The latter preserves the positivity of the particle distribution function. We derive analytically the conservation properties of both formulations, including particle number, momentum, and energy, which are verified numerically on the following benchmark problems: manufactured solution, linear and nonlinear Landau damping, two-stream instability, bump-on-tail instability, and ion-acoustic wave.</description>

      <title>How to split a tera-polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a new algorithm to compute all the roots of two families of polynomials that are of interest for the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$ : the roots of those polynomials are respectively the parameters $c\in\mathcal{M}$ associated with periodic critical dynamics for $f_c(z)=z^2+c$ (hyperbolic centers) or with pre-periodic dynamics (Misiurewicz-Thurston parameters). The algorithm is based on the computation of discrete level lines that provide excellent starting points for the Newton method. In practice, we observe that these polynomials can be split in linear time of the degree. This article is paired with a code library [Mandel] that implements this algorithm. Using this library and about 723 000 core-hours on the HPC center Rom\'eo (Reims), we have successfully found all hyperbolic centers of period $\leq 41$ and all Misiurewicz-Thurston parameters whose period and pre-period sum to $\leq 35$. Concretely, this task involves splitting a tera-polynomial, i.e. a polynomial of degree $\sim10^{12}$, which is orders of magnitude ahead of the previous state of the art. It also involves dealing with the certifiability of our numerical results, which is an issue that we address in detail, both mathematically and along the production chain. The certified database is available to the scientific community. For the smaller periods that can be represented using only hardware arithmetic (floating points FP80), the implementation of our algorithm can split the corresponding polynomials of degree $\sim10^{9}$ in less than one day-core. We complement these benchmarks with a statistical analysis of the separation of the roots, which confirms that no other polynomial in these families can be split without using higher precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the convergence of Newton's method for nonlinear elliptic PDEs using Fourier neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that Newton's method can have trouble converging if the initial guess is too far from the solution. Such a problem particularly occurs when this method is used to solve nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) discretized via finite differences. This work focuses on accelerating Newton's method convergence in this context. We seek to construct a mapping from the parameters of the nonlinear PDE to an approximation of its discrete solution, independently of the mesh resolution. This approximation is then used as an initial guess for Newton's method. To achieve these objectives, we elect to use a Fourier neural operator (FNO). The loss function is the sum of a data term (i.e., the comparison between known solutions and outputs of the FNO) and a physical term (i.e., the residual of the PDE discretization). Numerical results, in one and two dimensions, show that the proposed initial guess accelerates the convergence of Newton's method by a large margin compared to a naive initial guess, especially for highly nonlinear and anisotropic problems, with larger gains on coarse grids.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Differential Equations Using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations have a wide range of applications in modeling multiple physical, biological, or social phenomena. Therefore, we need to approximate the solutions of these equations in computationally feasible terms. Nowadays, among the most popular numerical methods for solving partial differential equations in engineering, we encounter the finite difference and finite element methods. An alternative numerical method that has recently gained popularity for numerically solving partial differential equations is the use of artificial neural networks.
  Artificial neural networks, or neural networks for short, are mathematical structures with universal approximation properties. In addition, thanks to the extraordinary computational development of the last decade, neural networks have become accessible and powerful numerical methods for engineers and researchers. For example, imaging and language processing are applications of neural networks today that show sublime performance inconceivable years ago.
  This dissertation contributes to the numerical solution of partial differential equations using neural networks with the following two-fold objective: investigate the behavior of neural networks as approximators of solutions of partial differential equations and propose neural-network-based methods for frameworks that are hardly addressable via traditional numerical methods.
  As novel neural-network-based proposals, we first present a method inspired by the finite element method when applying mesh refinements to solve parametric problems. Secondly, we propose a general residual minimization scheme based on a generalized version of the Ritz method. Finally, we develop a memory-based strategy to overcome a usual numerical integration limitation when using neural networks to solve partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: The limited angle Radon transform is notoriously difficult to invert due to its ill-posedness. In this work, we give a mathematical explanation that data-driven approaches can stably reconstruct more information compared to traditional methods like filtered backprojection. In addition, we use experiments based on the U-Net neural network to validate our theory.</description>

      <title>Estimation of uncertainties in the density driven flow in fractured porous media using MLMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Multi Level Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainties in a Henry-like salt water intrusion problem with a fracture. The flow is induced by the variation of the density of the fluid phase, which depends on the mass fraction of salt. We assume that the fracture has a known fixed location but an uncertain aperture. Other input uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields and the recharge. In our setting, porosity and permeability vary spatially and recharge is time-dependent. For each realisation of these uncertain parameters, the evolution of the mass fraction and pressure fields is modelled by a system of non-linear and time-dependent PDEs with a jump of the solution at the fracture. The uncertainties propagate into the distribution of the salt concentration, which is an important characteristic of the quality of water resources. We show that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is able to reduce the overall computational cost compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by balancing discretisation and statistical errors. Multiple scenarios are evaluated at different spatial and temporal mesh levels. The deterministic solver ug4 is run in parallel to calculate all stochastic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Vortex-capturing multiscale spaces for the Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers minimizers of the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional in particular multiscale spaces that are based on finite elements. The spaces are constructed by localized orthogonal decomposition techniques and their usage for solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation was first suggested in [D\"orich, Henning, SINUM 2024]. In this work we further explore their approximation properties and give an analytical explanation for why vortex structures of energy minimizers can be captured more accurately in these spaces. We quantify the necessary mesh resolution in terms of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$ and a stabilization parameter $\beta \ge 0$ that is used in the construction of the multiscale spaces. Furthermore, we analyze how $\kappa$ affects the necessary locality of the multiscale basis functions and we prove that the choice $\beta=0$ yields typically the highest accuracy. Our findings are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

      <description>arXiv:2407.02242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical training algorithm for standard feed-forward neural networks that adaptively extends the network architecture as soon as the optimization reaches a stationary point. By solving small (low-dimensional) optimization problems, the extended network provably escapes any local minimum or stationary point. Under some assumptions on the approximability of the data with stable neural networks, we show that the algorithm achieves an optimal convergence rate s in the sense that loss is bounded by the number of parameters to the -s. As a byproduct, we obtain computable indicators which judge the optimality of the training state of a given network and derive a new notion of generalization error.</description>

      <title>Learning a robust shape parameter for RBF approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial basis functions (RBFs) play an important role in function interpolation, in particular in an arbitrary set of interpolation nodes. The accuracy of the interpolation depends on a parameter called the shape parameter. There are many approaches in literature on how to appropriately choose it as to increase the accuracy of interpolation while avoiding instability issues. However, finding the optimal shape parameter value in general remains a challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach to determine the shape parameter in RBFs. First, we construct an optimisation problem to obtain a shape parameter that leads to an interpolation matrix with bounded condition number, then, we introduce a data-driven method that controls the condition of the interpolation matrix to avoid numerically unstable interpolations, while keeping a very good accuracy. In addition, a fall-back procedure is proposed to enforce a strict upper bound on the condition number, as well as a learning strategy to improve the performance of the data-driven method by learning from previously run simulations. We present numerical test cases to assess the performance of the proposed methods in interpolation tasks and in a RBF based finite difference (RBF-FD) method, in one and two-space dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We present some aspects of the theory of finite element exterior calculus as applied to partial differential equations on manifolds, especially manifolds endowed with an approximate metric called a Regge metric. Our treatment is intrinsic, avoiding wherever possible the use of preferred coordinates or a preferred embedding into an ambient space, which presents some challenges but also conceptual and possibly computational advantages. As an application, we analyze and implement a method for computing an approximate Levi-Civita connection form for a disc whose metric is itself approximate.</description>

Abstract: The deep operator networks (DeepONet), a class of neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces, have recently been developed as surrogate models for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work we propose a derivative-enhanced deep operator network (DE-DeepONet), which leverages derivative information to enhance the solution prediction accuracy and provides a more accurate approximation of solution-to-parameter derivatives, especially when training data are limited. DE-DeepONet explicitly incorporates linear dimension reduction of high dimensional parameter input into DeepONet to reduce training cost and adds derivative loss in the loss function to reduce the number of required parameter-solution pairs. We further demonstrate that the use of derivative loss can be extended to enhance other neural operators, such as the Fourier neural operator (FNO). Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning problems arise in many key areas of scientific computing where Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to model physical systems. In such scenarios, the operators map between Banach or Hilbert spaces. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning operators between Banach spaces, in contrast to the vast majority of past works considering only Hilbert spaces. We focus on learning holomorphic operators - an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures - specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth - under standard $\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the practical performance on challenging problems including the parametric diffusion, Navier-Stokes-Brinkman and Boussinesq PDEs.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are optimally adaptive to unknown low dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has emerged as a mainstream generative model in generative AI. While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.</description>

Abstract: Global minimization is a fundamental challenge in optimization, especially in machine learning, where finding the global minimum of a function directly impacts model performance and convergence. This article introduces a novel optimization method that we called Super Gradient Descent, designed specifically for one-dimensional functions, guaranteeing convergence to the global minimum for any k-Lipschitz function defined on a closed interval [a, b]. Our approach addresses the limitations of traditional optimization algorithms, which often get trapped in local minima. In particular, we introduce the concept of global gradient which offers a robust solution for precise and well-guided global optimization. By focusing on the global minimization problem, this work bridges a critical gap in optimization theory, offering new insights and practical advancements in different optimization problems in particular Machine Learning problems like line search.</description>

Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the phase field. In the presence of non-normality, the spectral analysis of such a matrix when (unknown or uncertain or time-dependent) constitutive parameters vary is generically not decisive to evaluate the material stability. We thus need to look at the pseudospectrum, that is, the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in an {\epsilon}-neighborhood of the matrix of interest. As a case study, we look at quasicrystals and evaluate through spectra and pseudospectra the influence of a microstructural self-action on the material stability. This approach allows us to reliably determine thresholds where stable-unstable transitions in the material behavior occur.</description>
