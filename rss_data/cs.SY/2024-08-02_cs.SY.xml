      <title>LSTM-Based Net Load Forecasting for Wind and Solar Power-Equipped Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising integration of variable renewable energy sources (RES), like solar and wind power, introduces considerable uncertainty in grid operations and energy management. Effective forecasting models are essential for grid operators to anticipate the net load - the difference between consumer electrical demand and renewable power generation. This paper proposes a deep learning (DL) model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for net load forecasting in renewable-based microgrids, considering both solar and wind power. The model's architecture is detailed, and its performance is evaluated using a residential microgrid test case based on a typical meteorological year (TMY) dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LSTM-based DL model in predicting the net load, showcasing its potential for enhancing energy management in renewable-based microgrids.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled In-context Learning for Wireless Network Optimization: A Case Study of Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) has recently been considered a promising technique for many fields. This work explores LLM-based wireless network optimization via in-context learning. To showcase the potential of LLM technologies, we consider the base station (BS) power control as a case study, a fundamental but crucial technique that is widely investigated in wireless networks. Different from existing machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed in-context learning algorithm relies on LLM's inference capabilities. It avoids the complexity of tedious model training and hyper-parameter fine-tuning, which is a well-known bottleneck of many ML algorithms. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first describes the target task via formatted natural language, and then designs the in-context learning framework and demonstration examples. After that, it considers two cases, namely discrete-state and continuous-state problems, and proposes state-based and ranking-based methods to select appropriate examples for these two cases, respectively. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve comparable performance as conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques without dedicated model training or fine-tuning. Such an efficient and low-complexity approach has great potential for future wireless network optimization.</description>

      <title>Joint Vehicle Connection and Beamforming Optimization in Digital Twin Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to harness digital twin (DT) technology in the realm of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in the sixth-generation (6G) Internet-of-everything (IoE) applications. We consider moving targets in a vehicular network and use DT to track and predict the motion of the vehicles. After predicting the location of the vehicle at the next time slot, the DT designs the assignment and beamforming for each vehicle. The real time sensing information is then utilized to update and refine the DT, enabling further processing and decision-making. This model incorporates a dynamic Kalman gain, which is updated at each time slot based on the received echo signals. The state representation encompasses both vehicle motion information and the error matrix, with the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) employed to assess sensing accuracy. We consider a network with two roadside units (RSUs), and the vehicles need to be allocated to one of them. To optimize the overall transmission rate while maintaining an acceptable sensing accuracy, an optimization problem is formulated. Since it is generally hard to solve the original problem, Lagrange multipliers and fractional programming are employed to simplify this optimization problem. To solve the simplified problem, this paper introduces both greedy and heuristic algorithms through optimizing both vehicle assignments and predictive beamforming. The optimized results are then transferred back to the real space for ISAC applications. Recognizing the computational complexity of the greedy and heuristic algorithms, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed for efficient beamforming design within the DT. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DT-based ISAC network.</description>

      <title>A Novel Edge Laplacian-based Approach for Adaptive Formation Control of Uncertain Multi-agent Systems with Unified Relative Error Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For most existing prescribed performance formation control methods, performance requirements are not directly imposed on the relative states between agents but on the consensus error, which lacks a clear physical interpretation of their solution. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive prescribed performance formation control strategy, capable of guaranteeing prescribed performance on the relative errors, for uncertain high-order multi-agent systems under a class of directed graphs. Due to the consideration of performance constraints for relative errors, a coupled nonlinear interaction term that contains global graphic information among agents is involved in the error dynamics, leading to a fully distributed control design more difficult and challenging. Here by proposing a series of nonlinear mappings and utilizing the edge Laplacian along with Lyapunov stability theory, the presented formation control scheme exhibits the following appealing features when compared to existing results: 1) different performance requirements can be guaranteed in a unified way by solely tuning the design parameters a priori, without the need for control redesign and stability reanalysis under the proposed fixed control protocol, making the design more user-friendly and the implementation less demanding; 2) the complex and burdensome verification process for the initial constraint, often encountered in existing prescribed performance controls, is completely obviated if the performance requirements are global; and 3) nonlinear interaction is completely decoupled and the asymptotic stability of the formation manifold is ensured via using the adaptive parameter estimate technique. Finally, simulations of various performance behaviors are performed to show the efficiency of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>MAARS: Multi-Rate Attack-Aware Randomized Scheduling for Securing Real-time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) consist of numerous control units interconnected by communication networks. Each control unit executes multiple safety-critical and non-critical tasks in real-time. Most of the safety-critical tasks are executed with a fixed sampling period to ensure deterministic timing behaviour that helps in its safety and performance analysis. However, adversaries can exploit this deterministic behaviour of safety-critical tasks to launch inference-based-based attacks on them. This paper aims to prevent and minimize the possibility of such timing inference or schedule-based attacks to compromise the control units. This is done by switching between strategically chosen execution rates of the safety-critical control tasks such that their performance remains unhampered. Thereafter, we present a novel schedule vulnerability analysis methodology to switch between valid schedules generated for these multiple periodicities of the control tasks in run time. Utilizing these strategies, we introduce a novel Multi-Rate Attack-Aware Randomized Scheduling (MAARS) framework for preemptive fixed-priority schedulers that minimize the success rate of timing-inference-based attacks on safety-critical real-time systems. To our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a schedule randomization method with attack awareness that preserves both the control and scheduling aspects. The efficacy of the framework in terms of attack prevention is finally evaluated on several automotive benchmarks in a Hardware-in-loop (HiL) environment.</description>

      <title>Task-oriented and Semantics-aware Communications for Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon the advent of the emerging metaverse and its related applications in Augmented Reality (AR), the current bit-oriented network struggles to support real-time changes for the vast amount of associated information, creating a significant bottleneck in its development. To address the above problem, we present a novel task-oriented and semantics-aware communication framework for augmented reality (TSAR) to enhance communication efficiency and effectiveness significantly. We first present an analysis of the traditional wireless AR point cloud communication framework, followed by a detailed summary of our proposed semantic information extraction within the end-to-end communication. Then, we detail the components of the TSAR framework, incorporating semantics extraction with deep learning, task-oriented base knowledge selection, and avatar pose recovery. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that our proposed TSAR framework considerably outperforms traditional point cloud communication framework, reducing wireless AR application transmission latency by 95.6% and improving communication effectiveness in geometry and color aspects by up to 82.4% and 20.4%, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Batch Update Using Multiplicative Noise Modelling for Extended Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the tracking of multiple extended targets demands for sophisticated algorithms to handle the high complexity inherent to the task, it also requires low runtime for online execution in real-world scenarios. In this work, we derive a batch update for the recently introduced elliptical-target tracker called MEM-EKF*. The MEM-EKF* is based on the same likelihood as the well-established random matrix approach but is derived from the multiplicative error model (MEM) and uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to update the target state sequentially, i.e., measurement-by-measurement. Our batch variant updates the target state in a single step based on straightforward sums over all measurements and the MEM-specific pseudo-measurements. This drastically reduces the scaling constant for typical implementations and indeed we find a speedup of roughly 100x in our numerical experiments. At the same time, the estimation error which we measure using the Gaussian Wasserstein distance stays significantly below that of the random matrix approach in coordinated turn scenarios while being comparable otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of inverter-based resources into the power grid, there has been a notable reduction in system inertia, potentially compromising frequency stability. To assess the suitability of existing area inertia estimation techniques for real-world power systems, this paper presents a rigorous comparative analysis of system identification, measurement reconstruction, and electromechanical oscillation-based area inertia estimation methodologies, specifically applied to the large-scale and multi-area WECC 240-bus power system. Comprehensive results show that the system identification-based approach exhibits superior robustness and accuracy relative to its counterparts.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based multi-step predictors for data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems through the velocity form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose kernel-based approaches for the construction of a single-step and multi-step predictor of the velocity form of nonlinear (NL) systems, which describes the time-difference dynamics of the corresponding NL system and admits a highly structured representation. The predictors in turn allow to formulate completely data-driven representations of the velocity form. The kernel-based formulation that we derive, inherently respects the structured quasi-linear and specific time-dependent relationship of the velocity form. This results in an efficient multi-step predictor for the velocity form and hence for nonlinear systems. Moreover, by using the velocity form, our methods open the door for data-driven behavioral analysis and control of nonlinear systems with global stability and performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of supporting next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC) within integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. We incorporate channel evaluation and retransmission mechanisms for real-time reliability enhancement. Using stochastic network calculus (SNC), we establish a theoretical framework to derive upper bounds for the peak age of information violation probability (PAVP) via characterized sensing and communication moment generation functions (MGFs). By optimizing these bounds, we develop power allocation schemes that significantly reduce the statistical PAVP of sensory packets in such networks. Simulations validate our theoretical derivations and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this brief, we discuss the implementation of a third order semi-implicit differentiator as a complement of the recent work by the author that proposes an interconnected semi-implicit Euler double differentiators algorithm through Taylor expansion refinement. The proposed algorithm is dual to the interconnected approach since it offers alternative flexibility to be tuned and to be implemented in real-time processes. In particular, an application to a numerical integration scheme is presented as the Taylor refinement can be of interest to improve the global convergence. Numerical results are presented to support the rightness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Counterclockwise Dissipativity, Potential Games and Evolutionary Nash Equilibrium Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use system-theoretic passivity methods to study evolutionary Nash equilibria learning in large populations of agents engaged in strategic, non-cooperative interactions. The agents follow learning rules (rules for short) that capture their strategic preferences and a payoff mechanism ascribes payoffs to the available strategies. The population's aggregate strategic profile is the state of an associated evolutionary dynamical system. Evolutionary Nash equilibrium learning refers to the convergence of this state to the Nash equilibria set of the payoff mechanism. Most approaches consider memoryless payoff mechanisms, such as potential games. Recently, methods using $\delta$-passivity and equilibrium independent passivity (EIP) have introduced dynamic payoff mechanisms. However, $\delta$-passivity does not hold when agents follow rules exhibiting ``imitation" behavior, such as in replicator dynamics. Conversely, EIP applies to the replicator dynamics but not to $\delta$-passive rules. We address this gap using counterclockwise dissipativity (CCW). First, we prove that continuous memoryless payoff mechanisms are CCW if and only if they are potential games. Subsequently, under (possibly dynamic) CCW payoff mechanisms, we establish evolutionary Nash equilibrium learning for any rule within a convex cone spanned by imitation rules and continuous $\delta$-passive rules.</description>

      <title>Blackout Mitigation via Physics-guided RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the sequential design of remedial control actions in response to system anomalies for the ultimate objective of preventing blackouts. A physics-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework is designed to identify effective sequences of real-time remedial look-ahead decisions accounting for the long-term impact on the system's stability. The paper considers a space of control actions that involve both discrete-valued transmission line-switching decisions (line reconnections and removals) and continuous-valued generator adjustments. To identify an effective blackout mitigation policy, a physics-guided approach is designed that uses power-flow sensitivity factors associated with the power transmission network to guide the RL exploration during agent training. Comprehensive empirical evaluations using the open-source Grid2Op platform demonstrate the notable advantages of incorporating physical signals into RL decisions, establishing the gains of the proposed physics-guided approach compared to its black box counterparts. One important observation is that strategically~\emph{removing} transmission lines, in conjunction with multiple real-time generator adjustments, often renders effective long-term decisions that are likely to prevent or delay blackouts.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Fast Geometric Learning of MIMO Signal Detection over Grassmannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10453v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain or statistical distribution shifts are a key staple of the wireless communication channel, because of the dynamics of the environment. Deep learning (DL) models for detecting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals in dynamic communication require large training samples (in the order of hundreds of thousands to millions) and online retraining to adapt to domain shift. Some dynamic networks, such as vehicular networks, cannot tolerate the waiting time associated with gathering a large number of training samples or online fine-tuning which incurs significant end-to-end delay. In this paper, a novel classification technique based on the concept of geodesic flow kernel (GFK) is proposed for MIMO signal detection. In particular, received MIMO signals are first represented as points on Grassmannian manifolds by formulating basis of subspaces spanned by the rows vectors of the received signal. Then, the domain shift is modeled using a geodesic flow kernel integrating the subspaces that lie on the geodesic to characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties of the received signals. The kernel derives low-dimensional representations of the received signals over the Grassman manifolds that are invariant to domain shift and is used in a geometric support vector machine (G-SVM) algorithm for MIMO signal detection in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method achieves promising performance against the existing baselines like OAMPnet and MMNet with only 1,200 training samples and without online retraining.</description>

      <title>TERIME: An improved RIME algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation for robust parameter extraction of photovoltaic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter extraction of photovoltaic (PV) models is crucial for the planning, optimization, and control of PV systems. Although some methods using meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to determine these parameters, the robustness of solutions obtained by these methods faces great challenges when the complexity of the PV model increases. The unstable results will affect the reliable operation and maintenance strategies of PV systems. In response to this challenge, an improved RIME algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation is proposed for robust and accurate parameter identification for various PV models. Specifically, the differential evolution mutation operator is integrated in the exploration phase to enhance the population diversity. Meanwhile, a new exploitation strategy incorporating randomization and neighborhood strategies simultaneously is developed to maintain the balance of exploitation width and depth. The improved RIME algorithm is applied to estimate the optimal parameters of the single-diode model (SDM), double-diode model (DDM), and triple-diode model (TDM) combined with the Lambert-W function for three PV cell and module types including RTC France, Photo Watt-PWP 201 and S75. According to the statistical analysis in 100 runs, the TEIMRE achieves more accurate and robust parameter estimations than other techniques to various PV models in varying environmental conditions. All of our source codes are publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TERIME.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Functional Insufficiencies and Triggering Conditions to Improve the SOTIF of an MPC-based Trajectory Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated and autonomous driving has made a significant technological leap over the past decade. In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Reinforcement Learning of Koopman Models for Economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01674v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Economic) nonlinear model predictive control ((e)NMPC) requires dynamic models that are sufficiently accurate and computationally tractable. Data-driven surrogate models for mechanistic models can reduce the computational burden of (e)NMPC; however, such models are typically trained by system identification for maximum prediction accuracy on simulation samples and perform suboptimally in (e)NMPC. We present a method for end-to-end reinforcement learning of Koopman surrogate models for optimal performance as part of (e)NMPC. We apply our method to two applications derived from an established nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor model. The controller performance is compared to that of (e)NMPCs utilizing models trained using system identification, and model-free neural network controllers trained using reinforcement learning. We show that the end-to-end trained models outperform those trained using system identification in (e)NMPC, and that, in contrast to the neural network controllers, the (e)NMPC controllers can react to changes in the control setting without retraining.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Setup for Testing Low-Frequency Disturbances of Power Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency disturbances of power quality are one of the most common disturbances in the power grid. These disturbances are most often the result of the impact of power electronic and energy-saving devices, the number of which is increasing significantly in the power grid. Due to the simultaneous operation of various types of loads in the power grid, various types of simultaneous disturbances of power quality occur, such as voltage fluctuations and distortions. Therefore, there is a need to analyze this type of simultaneous interaction. For this purpose, a special and complementary laboratory setup has been prepared, which allows for the examination of actual states occurring in modern power networks. Selected research results are presented for this laboratory setup, which determine its basic properties. Possible applications and possibilities of the laboratory setup are presented from the point of view of current challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing control policies for stabilization tasks with provable guarantees is a long-standing problem in nonlinear control. A crucial performance metric is the size of the resulting region of attraction, which essentially serves as a robustness "margin" of the closed-loop system against uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a new method to train a stabilizing neural network controller along with its corresponding Lyapunov certificate, aiming to maximize the resulting region of attraction while respecting the actuation constraints. Crucial to our approach is the use of Zubov's Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which precisely characterizes the true region of attraction of a given control policy. Our framework follows an actor-critic pattern where we alternate between improving the control policy (actor) and learning a Zubov function (critic). Finally, we compute the largest certifiable region of attraction by invoking an SMT solver after the training procedure. Our numerical experiments on several design problems show consistent and significant improvements in the size of the resulting region of attraction.</description>

      <title>Proper Implicit Discretization of Arbitrary-Order Robust Exact Differentiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the implicit Euler discretization of Levant's arbitrary order robust exact differentiator in presence of sampled measurements. Existing implicit discretizations of that differentiator are shown to exhibit either unbounded bias errors or, surprisingly, discretization chattering despite the use of the implicit discretization. A new, proper implicit discretization that exhibits neither of these two detrimental effects is proposed by computing the differentiator's outputs as appropriately designed linear combinations of its state variables. A numerical differentiator implementation is discussed and closed-form stability conditions for arbitrary differentiation orders are given. The influence of bounded measurement noise and numerical approximation errors is formally analyzed. Numerical simulations confirm the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</description>

      <title>A real/fast-time simulator for impact assessment of spoofing &amp; jamming attacks on GNSS receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In aviation, the impact of threats is becoming increasingly significant, particularly for global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Two relevant GNSS threats are represented by jamming and spoofing. In order to evaluate the technological solutions to counter GNSS attacks, such attacks should be assessed by means of a proper GNSS threat simulator. This work shows the implementation and the testing results of a GNSS security impact simulator which injects the desired threat scenarios as a deviations on the GNSS actual measurements. The proposed simulator can be integrated in both real- and fast-time simulation environments. The provided results confirm the effectiveness of the simulator, and include in-flight demonstrations by means of a flight experimental vehicle.</description>

      <title>Thin Film Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Harmonic Beam Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter explores an implementation of a novel thin film 1-by-4 reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designed for future communication and sensing scenarios. Utilizing cost-effective inkjet printing methods and additive manufacturing, our approach significantly simplifies the RIS construction process and reduces production costs. The RIS, fabricated on a flexible and lightweight polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, integrates antennas, switching circuitry, and a microcontroller unit (MCU), without a ground shield. This setup enables individual and simultaneous control of each RIS element, manipulating the captured carrier signal by reflecting and refracting its dominant harmonics. Beams of the harmonics can be steered to multiple desired directions at both front and back sides of the surface. Measurement results of the beam steering show that the RIS has the potential to enable RIS-aided communication and sensing applications.</description>
