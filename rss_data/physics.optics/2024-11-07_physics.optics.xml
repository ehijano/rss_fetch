      <title>A theory of Stimulated and Spontaneous Axion Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory for nonlinear, resonant excitation of dynamical axions by counter-propagating electromagnetic waves in materials that break both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries. We show that dynamical axions can mediate an exponential growth in the amplitude of the lower frequency (Stokes) beam. We also discuss spontaneous generation of a counter-propagating Stokes mode, enabled by resonant amplification of quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of a single pump laser. Remarkably, the amplification can be orders of magnitude larger than that obtained via stimulated Brillouin and Raman scattering processes, and can be modulated with the application of external magnetic fields, making stimulated axion scattering promising for optoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Classifying Photonic Topology Using the Spectral Localizer and Numerical $K$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras, and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology. In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework, including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.</description>

      <title>"Super-resolution" holographic optical tweezers array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning light spots into arbitrary shapes is a fundamental challenge in holography, leading to various applications across diverse fields in science and engineering. However, as the spot interval approaches the wavelength of light, interference effects among the spots become prominent, which complicates the generation of a distortion-free alignment. Herein, we introduce a hologram design method based on the optimisation of a nonlinear cost function using a holographic phase pattern as the optimisation parameter. We confirmed a spot interval of 0.952(1) $\mu$m in a $5 \times 5$ multispot pattern on the focal plane of a high-numerical-aperture (0.75) objective by observing the near-infrared (wavelength: 820 nm) holographic output light from a spatial light modulator device, a result which overcomes the limitation of a few micrometres under similar conditions. Furthermore, the definition of the Rayleigh diffraction limit is refined by considering the separation of spots and the spot interval, thereby concluding the achievement of "super-resolution." The proposed method is expected to advance laser fabrication, scanning laser microscopy, and cold atom physics, among other fields.</description>

      <title>Tuning One Dimensional Plasmonic Gap at Nanometer Scale for Advanced SERS Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hotspots, which are typically found in nanogaps between metal structures, are critical for the enhancement of the electromagnetic field. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), a technique known for its exceptional sensitivity and molecular detection capability, relies on the creation of these hotspots within nanostructures, where localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) amplifies Raman signals. However, creating adjustable nanogaps on a large scale remains challenging, particularly for applications involving biomacromolecules of various sizes. The development of tunable plasmonic nanostructures on flexible substrates represents a significant advance in the creation and precise control of these hotspots. Our work introduces tunable nanogaps on flexible substrates, utilizing thermally responsive materials to allow real-time control of gap width for different molecule sizes. Through advanced nanofabrication techniques, we have achieved uniform, tunable nanogaps over large areas wafer scale, enabling dynamic modulation of SERS signals. This approach resulted in an enhancement factor of over 10^7, sufficient for single-molecule detection, with a detection limit as low as 10^-12 M. Our thermally tunable nanogaps provide a powerful tool for precise detection of molecules and offer significant advantages for a wide range of sensing and analytical applications</description>

      <title>Topological Dirac-vortex modes in a three-dimensional photonic topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, topological Dirac-vortex modes in Kekul\'e-distorted photonic lattices have attracted broad interest and exhibited promising applications in robust photonic devices such as topological cavities, lasers, and fibers. However, due to the vectorial nature of electromagnetic waves that results in complicated band dispersions and fails the tight-binding model predictions, it is challenging to construct three-dimensional (3D) topological photonic structures with Kekul\'e distortion and the photonic topological Dirac-vortex modes have thus far been limited to two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, by directly mapping a 3D Kekul\'e-distorted tight-binding model in a 3D tight-binding-like photonic crystal exhibiting scalar-wave-like band structures, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate topological Dirac-vortex modes in a 3D photonic topological insulator for the first time. Using microwave near-field measurements, we directly observe robust photonic topological Dirac-vortex modes bound to and propagate along a one-dimensional (1D) Dirac-vortex line defect, matching well with the tight-binding and simulation results. Our work offers an ideal platform to map tight-binding models in 3D topological photonic crystals directly and opens a new avenue for exploiting topological lattice defects to manipulate light in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Emulating a quantum Maxwell's demon with non-separable structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maxwell's demon (MD) has proven an instructive vehicle by which to explore the relationship between information theory and thermodynamics, fueling the possibility of information driven machines. A long standing debate has been the concern of entropy violation, now resolved by the introduction of a quantum MD, but this theoretical suggestion has proven experimentally challenging. Here, we use classical vectorially structured light that is non-separable in spin and orbital angular momentum to emulate a quantum MD experiment. Our classically entangled light fields have all the salient properties necessary of their quantum counterparts but without the experimental complexity of controlling quantum entangled states. We use our experiment to show that the demon's entropy increases during the process while the system's entropy decreases, so that the total entropy is conserved through an exchange of information, confirming the theoretical prediction. We show that our MD is able to extract useful work from the system in the form of orbital angular momentum, opening a path to information driven optical spanners for the mechanical rotation of objects with light. Our synthetic dimensions of angular momentum can easily be extrapolated to other degrees of freedom, for scalable and robust implementations of MDs at both the classical and quantum realms, enlightening the role of a structured light MD and its capability to control and measure information.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical microgear cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel optomechanical microgear cavity for both optical and mechanical isotropic materials, featuring a single etch configuration. The design leverages a conjunction of phononic and photonic crystal-like structures to achieve remarkable confinement of both optical and mechanical fields. The microgear cavity we designed in amorphous silicon nitride exhibits a mechanical resonance at 4.8 GHz, and whispering gallery modes in the near-infrared, with scattering-limited quality factors above the reported material limit of up $10^7$. Notably, the optomechanical photoelastic overlap contribution reaches 75% of the ideal configuration seen in a floating ring structure.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, loss, and quantumness: When balanced beam splitters are best</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crux of quantum optics is using beam splitters to generate entanglement, including in pioneering experiments conducted by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss and Hong, Ou, and Mandel. This lies at the heart of what makes boson sampling hard to emulate by classical computers and is a vital component of quantum computation with light. Yet, despite overwhelming positive evidence, the conjecture that beam splitters with equal reflection and transmission probabilities generate the most entanglement for any state interfered with the vacuum has remained unproven for almost two decades [Asb\'oth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{94}, 173602 (2005)]. We prove this conjecture for ubiquitous entanglement monotones by uncovering monotonicity, convexity, and entropic properties of states undergoing photon loss. Because beam splitters are so fundamental, our results yield numerous corollaries for quantum optics, from inequalities for quasiprobability distributions to proofs of a recent conjecture for the evolution of a measure of quantumness through loss. One can now definitively state: the more balanced a beam splitter, the more entanglement it can generate with the vacuum.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Induced Spectral Splitting versus Rabi Splitting under Strong Light-Matter Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of strong light-matter coupling is typically associated with the observation of Rabi splitting, corresponding to the formation of the hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, this relationship is derived based on the assumption that disorder can be ignored or acts as a perturbative effect. Contrary to conventional treatment of disorder effects, we investigate the impact of strong disorder on the absorption spectrum by developing a non-perturbative effective model combined with classical electrodynamics simulation. Intriguingly, we find that strong disorder leads to an enhanced spectral splitting that closely resembles Rabi splitting, yet originates from a fundamentally different mechanism as induced by the dark modes. Specifically, we examine a disordered molecular ensemble in proximity to a plasmonic nanodisk and demonstrate disorder-induced spectral splitting in the absorption spectrum. This conclusion raises a controversial issue, suggesting that both polaritons (dominate in the strong coupling regime) and dark modes (dominate in the strong disorder regime) can lead to spectral splitting, and one cannot distinguish them solely based on the steady-state absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>PACE: Pacing Operator Learning to Accurate Optical Field Simulation for Complicated Photonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic field simulation is central to designing, optimizing, and validating photonic devices and circuits. However, costly computation associated with numerical simulation poses a significant bottleneck, hindering scalability and turnaround time in the photonic circuit design process. Neural operators offer a promising alternative, but existing SOTA approaches, NeurOLight, struggle with predicting high-fidelity fields for real-world complicated photonic devices, with the best reported 0.38 normalized mean absolute error in NeurOLight. The inter-plays of highly complex light-matter interaction, e.g., scattering and resonance, sensitivity to local structure details, non-uniform learning complexity for full-domain simulation, and rich frequency information, contribute to the failure of existing neural PDE solvers. In this work, we boost the prediction fidelity to an unprecedented level for simulating complex photonic devices with a novel operator design driven by the above challenges. We propose a novel cross-axis factorized PACE operator with a strong long-distance modeling capacity to connect the full-domain complex field pattern with local device structures. Inspired by human learning, we further divide and conquer the simulation task for extremely hard cases into two progressively easy tasks, with a first-stage model learning an initial solution refined by a second model. On various complicated photonic device benchmarks, we demonstrate one sole PACE model is capable of achieving 73% lower error with 50% fewer parameters compared with various recent ML for PDE solvers. The two-stage setup further advances high-fidelity simulation for even more intricate cases. In terms of runtime, PACE demonstrates 154-577x and 11.8-12x simulation speedup over numerical solver using scipy or highly-optimized pardiso solver, respectively. We open sourced the code and dataset.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of mixed-state tomography for photonic quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise-enhanced applications in open quantum walk (QW) have recently seen a surge due to their ability to improve performance. However, verifying the success of open QW is challenging, as mixed-state tomography is a resource-intensive process, and implementing all required measurements is almost impossible due to various physical constraints. To address this challenge, we present a neural-network-based method for reconstructing mixed states with a high fidelity (~97.5%) while costing only 50% of the number of measurements typically required for open discrete-time QW in one dimension. Our method uses a neural density operator that models the system and environment, followed by a generalized natural gradient descent procedure that significantly speeds up the training process. Moreover, we introduce a compact interferometric measurement device, improving the scalability of our photonic QW setup that enables experimental learning of mixed states. Our results demonstrate that highly expressive neural networks can serve as powerful alternatives to traditional state tomography.</description>

      <title>The method to improve the speed of RF switches based on vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a method to improve the switching rate of RF switches based on thermally induced phase change materials.Based on the principle that during the heating process, the increase in heat provided by the heating element plays a major role, while the heat dissipation effect of the bottom heat dissipation layer during the cooling process plays a major role. By replacing the heat dissipation layer material in the phase change RF switch with a high thermal conductivity material, the temperature rise rate of the phase change switch slightly decreases, while the temperature drop rate is significantly increased. Ultimately, the switching speed of the switch instances in this article increased by nearly 28.4%. The proposal of this method provides a new idea for optimizing the switching rate of RF switches based on thermally induced phase change materials in the future.</description>

      <title>A family of Fourier transform's eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a family of Fourier eigenfunctions indexed by the space dimension d. These eigenfunctions are radial and built upon some generalized exponential integral function. For d = 1, 2, 3, they are integrable or square integrable and give new explicit examples of Fourier eigenfunctions in the usual or Fourier-Plancherel sense. For d 4, the functions are examples of non standard eigenfunctions, i.e. eigenfunctions in the sense of distribution. The discovery of these eigenfunctions stems from research in thermal lens spectroscopy, at the intersection of thermodynamics and optics. Their use could simplify the analysis of thermo-optical systems, paving the way for applications in optical computing, material studies and thermodynamic.</description>

      <title>Controlling the degree of entanglement in downconversion by targeted birth zone activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of varying the pump beam waist that illuminates a nonlinear crystal, realizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The coherence is transferred from the marginal one-photon wavefunction to the two-photon wavefunction where it manifests into entanglement in the form of spatial correlation. We interpret this as a consequence of the number of independent emitters, called the biphoton birth zones, targeted by the pump beam on the crystal. The birth zone number $N$ characterises the number of such birth zones that fit along a diameter of the region illuminated by the pump waist. To experimentally observe the duality between the one- and two-photon interference, we employ a double slit and analyse their visibilities $V_m$ and $V_\text{12}$ respectively. We demonstrate the conservation of the quantity $V_m^2+V_\text{12}^2$. Finally, we identify three regimes of entanglement of the down-converted photons based on $N$. We show that changing the pump waist lets us actively control the degree of entanglement letting us access these regimes. We provide implications of each regime, and mention experimental use cases thereof.</description>

      <title>Quantified Advantage of Ghost Imaging over Regular Imaging</title>

Abstract: Ghost imaging is a remarkable technique where light that never interacts with an object is detected with a camera and still the image of the object is recorded. The method relies on the use of correlated light and an additional bucket detector. Ghost imaging has been used in archaeology, bio-medicine, for seeing through turbid media, and promises X-ray imaging improvements, amongst many other applications. However, the advantage of ghost imaging over regular imaging can be difficult to quantify. For classical ghost imaging of a single pixel aperture (the object), we find a closed analytic expression for the signal-to-noise ratio using basic statistics. We find that this signal-to-noise ratio can exceed that of regular imaging with the same exposure of the aperture when the detectors are sufficiently noisy, illustrating a simple and quantifiable advantage. Numerical simulation confirms the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Mode-locked GaN waveguide polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: So far, exciton-polariton (polariton) lasers were mostly single mode lasers based on microcavities. Despite the large repulsive polariton-polariton interaction, pulsed mode-locked polariton laser was never reported. Here, we use a $60 \ \mu m-$long GaN-based waveguide surrounded by distributed Bragg reflectors forming a multi-mode horizontal cavity. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically a polariton mode-locked micro-laser operating in the blue-UV, at room temperature, with a 300$\ GHz$ repetition rate and 100$\ fs$-long pulses. The mode locking is demonstrated by the compensation (linearization) of the mode dispersion by the self-phase modulation induced by the polariton-polariton interaction. It is also supported by the observation in experiment and theory of the typical envelope frequency profile of a bright soliton.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Product Space for Studying the Interaction of Bipartite States of Light with Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are important for applications in quantum nanophotonics, where their theoretical description must accommodate their bipartite character. Such character is shared at the other end of the intensity range by, for example, the two degenerate instances of the pump field involved in second-harmonic generation. The description and numerical simulation of the interaction of nanophotonic structures with bipartite states of light is challenging regardless of their intensity, and has important technological applications. To address such a challenge, we develop here a theoretical and computational framework for studying the interaction of material structures with bipartite states of light. The theory of the framework rests on the symmetrized tensor product space of two copies of an electromagnetic Hilbert space. For the computational side, the convenient T-matrix method is extended to the tensor product space. When the response of the object to one part of the state is independent of the other part, the T-matrix for bipartite states is a simple function of the typical T-matrix of the single Hilbert space. Such separable material response is relevant, for example, in the interaction of entangled biphoton states with nanostructures. Non-separable operators are identified as the adequate objects to fully integrate non-linear effects such as sum frequency generation or parametric down-conversion. As an example of application, we derive selection rules for second-order non-linear processes in objects with rotational and/or mirror symmetries, and verify them numerically in two different MoS$_2$ clusters.</description>

      <title>Chiral Dichroism in Resonant Metasurfaces with Monoclinic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral response can be achieved in resonant metasurfaces with a monoclinic lattice symmetry (the so-called Bravais oblique lattices) where the mirror symmetry is broken by the lattice asymmetry and also by a substrate, whereas each individual meta-atom remains fully achiral. We describe the underlying physics by introducing a mode chirality parameter as a quantitative measure of the lattice chiral eigenmodes. We confirm experimentally selective linear and nonlinear chiral interaction of resonant silicon metasurfaces with circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>Feedback Intensity Equalization Algorithm for Multi-Spots Holographic Tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to the high degree of adjustability, holographic tweezer array has been proved to be the best choice to create arbitrary geometries atomic array. In holographic tweezer array experiment, optical tweezer generated by spatial light modulator (SLM) usually is used as static tweezer array. Due to the alternating current(AC) stark shifts effect, intensity difference of traps will cause different light shift. So, the optimization of intensity equalization is very important in many-body system consist of single atoms. Here we report a work on studying of intensity equalization algorithm. Through this algorithm, the uniformity of tweezer can exceed 96% when the number of tweezer size is bigger than 1000. Our analysis shows that further uniformity requires further optimization of optical system. The realization of the intensity equalization algorithm is of great significance to the many-body experiments based on single atom array.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of phase information from low-dose electron microscopy experiments: are we at the limit yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of imaging low-density objects in an electron microscope without causing beam damage is significant in modern TEM. This is especially true for life science imaging, where the sample, rather than the instrument, still determines the resolution limit. Here, we explore whether we have to accept this or can progress further in this area. To do this, we use numerical simulations to see how much information we can obtain from a weak phase object at different electron doses. Starting from a model with four phase values, we compare Zernike phase contrast with measuring diffracted intensity under multiple random phase illuminations to solve the inverse problem. Our simulations have shown that diffraction-based methods perform better than the Zernike method, as we have found and addressed a normalization issue that, in some other studies, led to an overly optimistic representation of the Zernike setup. We further validated this using more realistic 2D objects and found that random phase illuminated diffraction can be up to five times more efficient than an ideal Zernike implementation. These findings suggest that diffraction-based methods could be a promising approach for imaging beam-sensitive materials and that current low-dose imaging methods are not yet at the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Momentum flatband and superluminal propagation in a photonic time Moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands typically describe energy bands whose energy dispersion is entirely or almost entirely degenerate. One effective method to form flat bands is by constructing Moir\'e superlattices. Recently, there has been a shift in perspective regarding the roles of space (momentum) and time (energy) in a lattice, with the concept of photonic time crystals that has sparked discussions on momentum dispersion such as the presence of a bandgap in momentum. Here we propose a photonic time moir\'e superlattice achieved by overlaying two photonic time crystals with different periods. The resulting momentum bandgap of this superlattice supports isolated momentum bands that are nearly independent of energy, which we refer to as momentum flat bands. Unlike energy flat bands, which have zero group velocity, momentum flat bands exhibit infinitely large group velocity across a broad frequency range. Unlike previous optical media supporting broadband superluminal propagation based on gain, the effective refractive index of the momentum flat bands is real-valued, leading to more stabilized superluminal pulse propagation.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal topology of plasmonic spin meron pairs revealed by polarimetric photo-emission microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.</description>

      <title>Gain-induced group delay in spontaneous parametric down-conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly-driven nonlinear optical processes such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing can produce multiphoton nonclassical beams of light which have applications in quantum information processing and sensing. In contrast to the low-gain regime, new physical effects arise in a high-gain regime due to the interactions between the nonclassical light and the strong pump driving the nonlinear process. Here, we describe and experimentally observe a gain-induced group delay between the multiphoton pulses generated in a high-gain type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. Since the group delay introduces distinguishability between the generated photons, it will be important to compensate for it when designing quantum interference devices in which strong optical nonlinearities are required.</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a global calibration approach for large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beam splitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Spherical Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Updates to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>
