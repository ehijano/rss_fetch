      <title>Diffusive Spreading Across Dynamic Mitochondrial Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of physical units can vary from a stationary set of spatially-embedded links to a collection of mobile agents that undergo transient social interactions. In living cells, mitochondria form architectures that span across these regimes, transitioning between fragmented, partly connected, and highly fused structures depending on cell type and state. Diffusive transport of biomolecular components through these networks helps to homogenize the mitochondrial population. Here we address the connection between dynamic network architecture and the rate of diffusive mixing through simulations and analytic models that incorporate fusion, fission, and rearrangement. We find that the material delivered from a source to the rest of the network depends on the network dimensionality and a balance of competing timescales for encounter, fusion, and diffusive dispersion. These results provide a quantitative basis for predicting the homogenization of proteins, lipids, ions, or genetic material through the mitochondrial population. The general principles identified in this work capture diffusive spreading through both social and physical networks, unifying a continuum of spatial network architectures.</description>

      <title>Insights into the role of dynamical features in protein complex formation: the case of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding with ACE2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functionality of protein-protein complexes is closely tied to the strength of their interactions, making the evaluation of binding affinity a central focus in structural biology. However, the molecular determinants underlying binding affinity are still not fully understood. In particular, the entropic contributions, especially those arising from conformational dynamics, remain poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the relationship between protein motion and binding stability and its role in protein function. To gain deeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we investigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary history: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2 receptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through Molecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical differences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike protein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more stable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in their unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed after binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole driving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized by a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but could optimize other traits, such as antibody escape. These results suggest that to fully understand the strength of the binding between two proteins, the stability of the two isolated partners should be investigated.</description>

      <title>Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of adhesion and phase separation during cell-cell contact across a viscous channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact between fluctuating, fluid-lubricated soft surfaces is prevalent in engineering and biological systems, a process starting with adhesive contact, which can give rise to complex coarsening dynamics. One representation of such a system, which is relevant to biological membrane adhesion, is a fluctuating elastic interface covered by adhesive molecules that bind and unbind to a solid substrate across a narrow gap filled with a viscous fluid. This flow is described by the stochastic elastohydrodynamics thin-film equation, which combines the effects of viscous nanometric thin film flow, elastic membrane properties, adhesive springs, and thermal fluctuations. The average time it takes the fluctuating elastic membrane to adhere is predicted by the rare event theory, increasing exponentially with the square of the initial gap height. Numerical simulations reveal a phase separation of membrane domains driven by the binding and unbinding of adhesive molecules. The coarsening process displays close similarities to classical Ostwald ripening; however, the inclusion of hydrodynamics affects power-law growth. In particular, we identify a new bending-dominated coarsening regime, which is slower than the well-known tension-dominated case.</description>

      <title>Single-cell metabolic flux analysis reveals coexisting optimal sub-groups, cross-feeding, and mixotrophy in a cyanobacterial population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a single-cell level understanding of metabolism in an isogenic cyanobacterial population by integrating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) derived multi-isotope uptake measurements of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 with a statistical inference protocol based on Liebig's law of the minimum, the maximum entropy principle, and constraint-based modeling. We find the population is structured in two metabolically distinct clusters: cells optimizing carbon yield while excessively turning over nitrogen, and cells which act reciprocally, optimizing nitrogen yield and excessively turning over carbon. This partition enables partial heterotrophy within the population via metabolic exchange, likely in the form of organic acids. Exchange increases the feasible metabolic space, and mixotrophic cells achieve the fastest growth rates. Metabolic flux analysis at the single-cell level reveals heterogeneity in carbon fixation rates, Rubisco specificity, and nitrogen assimilation. Our results provide a necessary foundation for understanding how population level phenotypes arise from the collective contributions of distinct individuals.</description>

      <title>Charge Transport at Atomic Scales in 1D-Semiconductors: A Quantum Statistical Model Allowing Rigorous Numerical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in understanding charge transport at atomic scales. The motivations are myriad, including understanding the conductance properties of peptides measured experimentally. In this study, we propose a model of quantum statistical mechanics which aims to investigate the transport properties of 1D-semiconductor at nanoscales. The model is a two-band Hamiltonian in which electrons are assumed to be quasi-free. It allows us to investigate the behaviour of current and quantum fluctuations under the influence of numerous parameters, showing the response with respect to varying voltage, temperature and length. We compute the current observable at each site and demonstrate the local behaviour generating the current.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Optical Properties of Biological Structures using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>
