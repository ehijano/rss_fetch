      <title>Canalization as a stabilizing principle of gene regulatory networks: a discrete dynamical systems perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining functional phenotypes despite genetic and environmental perturbations. Discrete dynamical models, such as Boolean networks, provide systems biologists with a tractable framework to explore the mathematical underpinnings of this robustness. A key mechanism conferring stability is canalization. This perspective synthesizes historical insights, formal definitions of canalization in discrete dynamical models, quantitative measures of stability, illustrative applications, and emerging challenges at the interface of theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Learning the principles of T cell antigen discernment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T cells are central to the adaptive immune response, capable of detecting pathogenic antigens while ignoring healthy tissues with remarkable specificity and sensitivity. Quantitatively understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) discriminate among antigens requires biophysical models and theoretical analysis of signaling networks. Here, we review current theoretical frameworks of antigen recognition in the context of modern experimental and computational advances. Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals. Advances in high-throughput technologies now generate large-scale, quantitative datasets, enabling the refinement of such models through statistical and machine learning approaches. This convergence of theory, data, and computation promises deeper insights into immune decision-making and opens new avenues for rational immunotherapy design.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Autocatalytic Subsystems in Large Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autocatalysis is an important feature of metabolic networks, contributing crucially to the self-maintenance of organisms. Autocatalytic subsystems of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are characterized in terms of algebraic conditions on submatrices of the stoichiometric matrix. Here, we derive sufficient conditions for subgraphs supporting irreducible autocatalytic systems in the bipartite K\"onig representation of the CRN. On this basis, we develop an efficient algorithm to enumerate autocatalytic subnetworks and, as a special case, autocatalytic cores, i.e., minimal autocatalytic subnetworks, in full-size metabolic networks. The same algorithmic approach can also be used to determine autocatalytic cores only. As a showcase application, we provide a complete analysis of autocatalysis in the core metabolism of E. coli and enumerate irreducible autocatalytic subsystems of limited size in full-fledged metabolic networks of E. coli, human erythrocytes, and Methanosarcina barkeri (Archea). The mathematical and algorithmic results are accompanied by software enabling the routine analysis of autocatalysis in large CRNs.</description>

      <title>KINDLE: Knowledge-Guided Distillation for Prior-Free Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular decision-making processes. Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.</description>
