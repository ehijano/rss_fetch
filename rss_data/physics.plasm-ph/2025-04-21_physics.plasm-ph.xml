      <title>Modeling transport in weakly collisional plasmas using thermodynamic forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How momentum, energy, and magnetic fields are transported in the presence of macroscopic gradients is a fundamental question in plasma physics. Answering this question is especially challenging for weakly collisional, magnetized plasmas, where macroscopic gradients influence the plasma's microphysical structure. In this paper, we introduce thermodynamic forcing, a new method for systematically modeling how macroscopic gradients in magnetized or unmagnetized plasmas shape the distribution functions of constituent particles. In this method, we propose to apply an anomalous force to those particles inducing the anisotropy that would naturally emerge due to macroscopic gradients in weakly collisional plasmas. We implement thermodynamic forcing in particle-in-cell (TF-PIC) simulations using a modified Vay particle pusher and validate it against analytic solutions of the equations of motion. We then carry out a series of simulations of electron-proton plasmas with periodic boundary conditions using TF-PIC. First, we confirm that the properties of two electron-scale kinetic instabilities -- one driven by a temperature gradient and the other by pressure anisotropy -- are consistent with previous results. Then, we demonstrate that in the presence of multiple macroscopic gradients, the saturated state can differ significantly from current expectations. This work enables, for the first time, systematic and self-consistent transport modeling in weakly collisional plasmas, with broad applications in astrophysics, laser-plasma physics, and inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>A Binary Collision Method for Screened Coulomb Collisions in weakly and moderately coupled Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary-pairing Monte Carlo collision method is presented here for screened Coulomb collisions in plasmas that is valid in the weakly and moderately coupled regimes. The method models the Fokker-Planck collision operator with first order corrections with respect to the Coulomb logarithm in the appropriate limits and identically reduces to a standard Monte Carlo method for solving the Boltzmann collision integral for screened Rutherford collisions when the time step is sufficiently small. The method is exceptionally simple and can be integrated into existing binary methods for cumulative scattering with the addition of about 10 lines of code.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Amplification of Wavepacket Propagation in Traveling Wave Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze wavepacket propagation in traveling wave tubes (TWTs) analytically and numerically. TWT design in essence comprises a pencil-like electron beam in vacuum interacting with an electromagnetic wave guided by a slow-wave structure (SWS). In our study, the electron beam is represented by a one-dimensional electron flow and the SWS is represented by an equivalent transmission line model. The analytical considerations are based on the Lagrangian field theory for TWTs. Mathematical analysis of wavepacket propagation in one-dimensional space is based on the relevant Euler-Lagrange equations which are second-order differential equations in both time and space. Wavepacket propagation analysis is not simple and we develop a numerically efficient algorithm to perform the analysis efficiently. In particular, when the initial pulse has a Gaussian shape at the input port, it acquires non-Gaussian features as it propagates through the TWT. These features include: (i) super-exponential (faster than exponential) amplification, (ii) shift of the pulse frequency spectrum toward higher frequencies, and (iii) change in the shape of the pulse that becomes particularly pronounced when the pulse frequency band contains a transitional point from stability to instability.</description>

      <title>Impact of Azimuthal Magnetic Field Inhomogeneity on Hall Thruster high-frequency azimuthal instability via 2D radial-azimuthal PIC simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the SPT-type Hall thrusters, the magnetic structure with magnetic conductive columns leads inherent to azimuthally inhomogeneous magnetic configurations. This azimuthal magnetic inhomogeneity may impact electron azimuthal closed-drift motion and cross-field transport characteristics. This study systematically investigates the effects of azimuthal magnetic field gradient on high frequency azimuthal instability and associated anomalous electron transport through 2D radial-azimuthal Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. The results reveal dual mechanisms of magnetic inhomogeneity on electron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) characteristics: (1) The azimuthal drift velocity distribution becomes modulated by the magnetic field inhomogeneity, with increased average drift velocity enhancing ECDI intensity under stronger inhomogeneity; (2) Simultaneously, the ECDI wavenumber spectrum broadens with elevated magnetic inhomogeneity, reducing discrete ECDI spectral peaks. Under the dual influence of magnetic field inhomogeneity, when the inhomogeneity level is below 5%, the ECDI saturation amplitude and electron cross field mobility remains largely unchanged. However, a notable reduction of 13.4% in ECDI saturation intensity and a 15.7% decrease in electron mobility are observed when magnetic field inhomogeneity reaches 10%.</description>

      <title>3D PIC Study of Magnetic Field Effects on Hall Thruster Electron Drift Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully characterize electron drift instability, a critical phenomenon governing electron transport in Hall thrusters, large-scale three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are essential, as the instability inherently exhibits 3D features. While prior 3D PIC studies of this instability exist, their setups remain oversimplified to mitigate computational costs, often employing analytical approximations for ionization and magnetic fields. Notably, these models typically assume a purely radial magnetic field, significantly deviating from real thruster configurations. This work presents the first 3D PIC study incorporating realistic magnetic fields with both radial and axial components, coupled with a Monte Carlo collision model for ionization and a self-consistent fluid solver for neutral gas density. These advancements enable a systematic investigation of magnetic field effects on electron drift instability. Results demonstrate that both the spatial configuration and strength of the magnetic field profoundly influence instability dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discharge structure theory of highly electronegative plasma and its hierarchy and interdisciplinary meanings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the systematic theory of discharge structure is built for highly electronegative plasma, by means of self-consistent fluid model simulation that is based on the finite element method. The highly electronegative plasma is selected to be the inductively coupled Ar/SF6 plasma source with 10% the reactive SF6 concentration and in a pressure range of 10~90mTorr. The discharge structure is classified the transport dominated regime, transport and chemistry self-balanced regime and chemistry dominated regime. At low pressure of 10mTorr, the parabola feature of core plasma, stratification of whole discharge area into electronegative core and electropositive halo, anion potential barrel, and the dipole and capacitor models of double layer characterize the discharge structure of transport dominated regime. At increasing the pressure, the recombination loss of ions becomes significant and the discharge structure is characterized by ellipse profile. Meanwhile, the regions of double layer and electropositive halo are strikingly shrunk, which means that the plasma of transport and chemistry self-balanced regime is a close system and probably do not need the shield of chamber anymore. The dimensional analysis shows the recombination can be transformed into drift flux, which balances the ambi-polar diffusion of plasma species. In the range of pressure considered, simulation shows astro-structures are inlayed in the parabolic and elliptic profiles. At observing the characteristics of the astro-structures, the self-coagulation theory and quasi-Helmholtz equation are built based on the free diffusion and negative chemical source. This is the chemistry dominated regime and defined as a tight type of self-balance since the inertia is lost automatically in the unsteady state continuity equations of anions after counteracting the diffusion and recombination.</description>

      <title>Positive and negative DC glow discharges: a comparative study to characterize self-organized patterns on water surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organized patterns (SOP) in plasma discharges arise from the complex interplay of electric field, reactive species and charged particles, driven by non-linear plasma dynamics. While studies have explored SOP formation in various configurations, no systematic comparison of positive and negative DC glow discharges has been conducted to explain why SOP form exclusively when polarization is negative. This study aims to analyze SOP formation mechanisms by comparing electrical, optical and spectral properties of positive and negative DC glow discharges interacting with a grounded water surface. Key differences in gas temperature, electric field and reactive species distribution are hence identified. For positive DC glow discharges (PGD), the gas temperature remains in the 350-370 K range, while the reduced electric field remains below 100 Td across the gap. The plasma is dominated by OH and N2* species, whose excitation results from direct electron impact and energy transfer in a low-field environment. The absence of strong ionization and electric field gradients leads to a spatially homogeneous emission layer on the liquid surface, resulting in a circular uniform plasma (CUP) pattern without self-organization. In contrast, SOP emerge exclusively under negative DC glow discharges (NGD) at currents above 15 mA. These discharges present a reduced electric field, peaking at 485 Td at 1mm from the cathode pin, dropping below 100 Td in the central gap and rising to 460 Td near the water surface. There, the plasma layer still contains OH and N2* species but also N2+ ions, the latter being critical for SOP formation. SOP morphology evolves with gap size: at 7 mm, patterns transition from specks to filaments, with pattern diameter and thickness as high as 5.5 mm and 210 {\mu}m respectively. Lowering water surface tension with surfactants reduces SOP size and modifies pattern morphology.</description>

      <title>Transferred plasma catheter for endotherapeutic applications: a parametric study of guided streamers dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are increasingly used in biomedical applications due to their low temperatures and ability to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), making them suitable for sensitive environments like medical therapies. The transferred plasma catheter (TPC), a variant of APPJ, shows promise for endoscopic applications but requires precise control of plasma dynamics in confined spaces to ensure safety and efficacy. Despite extensive studies on guided streamers in traditional APPJs, there is limited understanding of streamer behavior in TPC configurations, particularly in challenging scenarios involving grounded metallic surfaces. This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of guided streamers generated by TPCs under varying gap distances to establish a robust framework for safe and effective plasma delivery in endoscopic settings. Combining electrical and optical diagnostics, the study characterizes streamer propagation, electric field profiles, and plasma-induced currents in a helium-driven TPC delivering cold plasma to a grounded metal target across gaps of 2 to 18 mm. Results show that streamers maintain charge stability and effectively interact with the target for gap distances below 12 mm, producing significant therapeutic currents. Beyond this threshold, propagation deteriorates due to recombination and reduced electric field intensity. For shorter gaps, counter-propagating waves and secondary streamer interactions are observed, while larger gaps lead to charge dissipation and reduced efficacy. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing gap distances for plasma-assisted endoscopic procedures and demonstrate the TPC's robustness in adverse conditions.</description>

      <title>10$^4$-fold amplification of a tiny magnetic field to megagauss scale in femtosecond, ultraintense laser-solid interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating a powerful and quasistatic magnetic field within the confines of a tabletop laboratory experiment has proven to be a persistent challenge. The creation of magnetized high-energy-density plasma through such experiments presents significant opportunities for exploring several terrestrial as well as astrophysical phenomena, apart from controlling relativistic electron transport, directly relevant for fusion schemes. Here we demonstrate that the modest magnetic field (10$^{-3}$ megagauss ) in a common, readily available Neodymium magnet is amplified to 10's of megagauss levels lasting a few picoseconds, when excited by an ultraintense, femtosecond laser pulse. The experimental findings are strongly supported by particle-in-cell simulations, which not only validate the observations but also unveil a potential dynamo mechanism responsible for the enhancement and amplification of the axial magnetic field. These outcomes are of utmost importance in comprehending the intricacies of relativistic electron transport and the realm of magnetized laboratory astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The universality of filamentation-caused challenges of ultrafast laser energy deposition in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagation in semiconductors is the cornerstone of emerging disruptive technologies holding considerable potential to revolutionize telecommunications, sensors, quantum engineering, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. Sky-high optical nonlinearities make these materials ideal platforms for photonic integrated circuits. The fabrication of such complex devices could greatly benefit from in-volume ultrafast laser writing for monolithic and contactless integration. Ironically, as exemplified for Si, nonlinearities act as an efficient immune system self-protecting the material from internal permanent modifications that ultrashort laser pulses could potentially produce. While nonlinear propagation of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses has been extensively investigated in Si, other semiconductors remain uncharted. In this work, we demonstrate that filamentation universally dictates ultrashort laser pulse propagation in various semiconductors. The effective key nonlinear parameters obtained strongly differ from standard measurements with low-intensity pulses. Furthermore, the temporal scaling laws for these key parameters are extracted. Temporal-spectral shaping is finally proposed to optimize energy deposition inside semiconductors. The whole set of results lays the foundations for future improvements, up to the point where semiconductors can be selectively tailored internally by ultrafast laser writing, thus leading to countless applications for in-chip processing and functionalization, and opening new markets in various sectors including technology, photonics, and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence driven by nonlinear wave-particle resonance coupling. Turbulent waves with distinct characteristic wavelengths across scales coherently interact with charged particles when their phase velocities match the particles' velocities. A multi-wavenumber mapping framework is developed to model chaotic transport under multi-scale turbulence. By analytically deriving velocity correlation functions, we quantify the diffusion coefficient under conditions of cross-scale wave intensity parity. A critical analysis reveals that chaotic dynamics at smaller scales prove insufficient to completely erase phase-space correlations established by large-scale turbulent components. The largest-scale turbulence components dominate deviations from quasi-linear (QL) theory predictions, establishing a scale-dependent hierarchy in chaotic transport. Mere reduction of inter-wave phase velocity spacing for small-scale components cannot recover QL diffusion at finite wave amplitudes in multi-scale turbulence. Incorporating a larger-scale component into a small-scale-driven strong chaotic system can induce non-QL diffusion. Specifically, for two-scale turbulence, the QL approximation systematically underestimates transport. Increasing the number of smaller-scale components with strong overlap parameters drives convergence toward the QL approximation. This framework provides a methodology for analyzing resonance-driven turbulence in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Confinement performance predictions for a high field axisymmetric tandem mirror</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Hammir tandem mirror confinement performance analysis based on Realta Fusion's first-of-a-kind model for axisymmetric magnetic mirror fusion performance. This model uses an integrated end plug simulation model including, heating, equilibrium, and transport combined with a new formulation of the plasma operation contours (POPCONs) technique for the tandem mirror central cell. Using this model in concert with machine learning optimization techniques, it is shown that an end plug utilizing high temperature superconducting magnets and modern neutral beams enables a classical tandem mirror pilot plant producing a fusion gain Q &gt; 5. The approach here represents an important advance in tandem mirror design. The high fidelity end plug model enables calculations of heating and transport in the highly non-Maxwellian end plug to be made more accurately. The detailed end plug modelling performed in this work has highlighted the importance of classical radial transport and neutral beam absorption efficiency on end plug viability. The central cell POPCON technique allows consideration of a wide range of parameters in the relatively simple near-Maxwellian central cell, facilitating the selection of more optimal central cell plasmas. These advances make it possible to find more conservative classical tandem mirror fusion pilot plant operating points with lower temperatures, neutral beam energies, and end plug performance requirements than designs in the literature. Despite being more conservative, it is shown that these operating points have sufficient confinement performance to serve as the basis of a viable fusion pilot plant provided that they can be stabilized against MHD and trapped particle modes.</description>
