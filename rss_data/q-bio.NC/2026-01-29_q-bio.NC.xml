      <title>Assembling the Mind's Mosaic: Towards EEG Semantic Intent Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling natural communication through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains one of the most profound challenges in neuroscience and neurotechnology. While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.</description>

      <title>Implications of temporal sampling in voltage imaging microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20236</link>

Abstract: Significance: Voltage imaging microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate neural activity both in vivo and in vitro. Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz.</description>

      <title>An explainable framework for the relationship between dementia and glucose metabolism patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging data presents challenges for assessing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.</description>
