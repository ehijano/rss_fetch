      <title>Predicting Confinement Effect of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers on Strength of Concrete using Metaheuristics-based Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the study of predicting the confinement effect of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) on concrete cylinder strength using metaheuristics-based artificial neural networks. A detailed database of 708 CFRP confined concrete cylinders is developed from previously published research with information on 8 parameters including geometrical parameters like the diameter (d) and height (h) of a cylinder, unconfined compressive strength of concrete (fco'), thickness (nt), the elastic modulus of CFRP (Ef), unconfined concrete strain confined concrete strain and the ultimate compressive strength of confined concrete fcc'. Three metaheuristic models are implemented including particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and bat algorithm (BA). These algorithms are trained on the data using an objective function of mean square error and their predicted results are validated against the experimental studies and finite element analysis. The study shows that the hybrid model of PSO predicted the strength of CFRP-confined concrete cylinders with maximum accuracy of 99.13% and GWO predicted the results with an accuracy of 98.17%. The high accuracy of axial compressive strength predictions demonstrated that these prediction models are a reliable solution to the empirical methods. The prediction models are especially suitable for avoiding full-scale time-consuming experimental tests that make the process quick and economical.</description>

      <title>Linearly Constrained Weights: Reducing Activation Shift for Faster Training of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first identify activation shift, a simple but remarkable phenomenon in a neural network in which the preactivation value of a neuron has non-zero mean that depends on the angle between the weight vector of the neuron and the mean of the activation vector in the previous layer. We then propose linearly constrained weights (LCW) to reduce the activation shift in both fully connected and convolutional layers. The impact of reducing the activation shift in a neural network is studied from the perspective of how the variance of variables in the network changes through layer operations in both forward and backward chains. We also discuss its relationship to the vanishing gradient problem. Experimental results show that LCW enables a deep feedforward network with sigmoid activation functions to be trained efficiently by resolving the vanishing gradient problem. Moreover, combined with batch normalization, LCW improves generalization performance of both feedforward and convolutional networks.</description>

      <title>Searching Search Spaces: Meta-evolving a Geometric Encoding for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary policy search, neural networks are usually represented using a direct mapping: each gene encodes one network weight. Indirect encoding methods, where each gene can encode for multiple weights, shorten the genome to reduce the dimensions of the search space and better exploit permutations and symmetries. The Geometric Encoding for Neural network Evolution (GENE) introduced an indirect encoding where the weight of a connection is computed as the (pseudo-)distance between the two linked neurons, leading to a genome size growing linearly with the number of genes instead of quadratically in direct encoding. However GENE still relies on hand-crafted distance functions with no prior optimization. Here we show that better performing distance functions can be found for GENE using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) in a meta-evolution approach, hence optimizing the encoding to create a search space that is easier to exploit. We show that GENE with a learned function can outperform both direct encoding and the hand-crafted distances, generalizing on unseen problems, and we study how the encoding impacts neural network properties.</description>

      <title>Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold learning techniques play a pivotal role in machine learning by revealing lower-dimensional embeddings within high-dimensional data, thus enhancing both the efficiency and interpretability of data analysis by transforming the data into a lower-dimensional representation. However, a notable challenge with current manifold learning methods is their lack of explicit functional mappings, crucial for explainability in many real-world applications. Genetic programming, known for its interpretable functional tree-based models, has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. Previous research leveraged multi-objective GP to balance manifold quality against embedding dimensionality, producing functional mappings across a range of embedding sizes. Yet, these mapping trees often became complex, hindering explainability. In response, in this paper, we introduce Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel approach that directly penalises tree complexity. Our new method is able to maintain high manifold quality while significantly enhancing explainability and also allows customisation of complexity measures, such as symmetry balancing, scaling, and node complexity, catering to diverse application needs. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that GP-EMaL is able to match the performance of the existing approach in most cases, while using simpler, smaller, and more interpretable tree structures. This advancement marks a significant step towards achieving interpretable manifold learning.</description>

      <title>Evolving Benchmark Functions to Compare Evolutionary Algorithms via Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we use Genetic Programming (GP) to compose new optimization benchmark functions. Optimization benchmarks have the important role of showing the differences between evolutionary algorithms, making it possible for further analysis and comparisons. We show that the benchmarks generated by GP are able to differentiate algorithms better than human-made benchmark functions. The fitness measure of the GP is the Wasserstein distance of the solutions found by a pair of optimizers. Additionally, we use MAP-Elites to both enhance the search power of the GP and also illustrate how the difference between optimizers changes by various landscape features. Our approach provides a novel way to automate the design of benchmark functions and to compare evolutionary algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stitching for Neuroevolution: Recombining Deep Neural Networks without Breaking Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to neuroevolution often start from scratch. This becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and data requirements when targeting modern, deep neural networks. Using a warm start could be highly advantageous, e.g., using previously trained networks, potentially from different sources. This moreover enables leveraging the benefits of transfer learning (in particular vastly reduced training effort). However, recombining trained networks is non-trivial because architectures and feature representations typically differ. Consequently, a straightforward exchange of layers tends to lead to a performance breakdown. We overcome this by matching the layers of parent networks based on their connectivity, identifying potential crossover points. To correct for differing feature representations between these layers we employ stitching, which merges the networks by introducing new layers at crossover points. To train the merged network, only stitching layers need to be considered. New networks can then be created by selecting a subnetwork by choosing which stitching layers to (not) use. Assessing their performance is efficient as only their evaluation on data is required. We experimentally show that our approach enables finding networks that represent novel trade-offs between performance and computational cost, with some even dominating the original networks.</description>

      <title>Reactor Optimization Benchmark by Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutronic calculations for reactors are a daunting task when using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. As high-performance computing has advanced, the simulation of a reactor is nowadays more readily done, but design and optimization with multiple parameters is still a computational challenge. MC transport simulations, coupled with machine learning techniques, offer promising avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of nuclear reactor optimization. This paper introduces a novel benchmark problem within the OpenNeoMC framework designed specifically for reinforcement learning. The benchmark involves optimizing a unit cell of a research reactor with two varying parameters (fuel density and water spacing) to maximize neutron flux while maintaining reactor criticality. The test case features distinct local optima, representing different physical regimes, thus posing a challenge for learning algorithms. Through extensive simulations utilizing evolutionary and neuroevolutionary algorithms, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in navigating complex optimization landscapes with strict constraints. Furthermore, we propose acceleration techniques within the OpenNeoMC framework, including model updating and cross-section usage by RAM utilization, to expedite simulation times. Our findings emphasize the importance of machine learning integration in reactor optimization and contribute to advancing methodologies for addressing intricate optimization challenges in nuclear engineering.

      <title>SpikingResformer: Bridging ResNet and Vision Transformer in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Vision Transformers in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has led to a growing interest in incorporating the self-attention mechanism and transformer-based architecture into Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that are compatible with SNNs, they lack reasonable scaling methods, and the overall architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively extracting local features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spiking self-attention mechanism named Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA) with a reasonable scaling method. Based on DSSA, we propose a novel spiking Vision Transformer architecture called SpikingResformer, which combines the ResNet-based multi-stage architecture with our proposed DSSA to improve both performance and energy efficiency while reducing parameters. Experimental results show that SpikingResformer achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption than other spiking Vision Transformer counterparts. Notably, our SpikingResformer-L achieves 79.40% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 4 time-steps, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.</description>

      <title>A reinforcement learning guided hybrid evolutionary algorithm for the latency location routing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latency location routing problem integrates the facility location problem and the multi-depot cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem. This problem involves making simultaneous decisions about depot locations and vehicle routes to serve customers while aiming to minimize the sum of waiting (arriving) times for all customers. To address this computationally challenging problem, we propose a reinforcement learning guided hybrid evolutionary algorithm following the framework of the memetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm relies on a diversity-enhanced multi-parent edge assembly crossover to build promising offspring and a reinforcement learning guided variable neighborhood descent to determine the exploration order of multiple neighborhoods. Additionally, strategic oscillation is used to achieve a balanced exploration of both feasible and infeasible solutions. The competitiveness of the algorithm against state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated by experimental results on the three sets of 76 popular instances, including 51 improved best solutions (new upper bounds) for the 59 instances with unknown optima and equal best results for the remaining instances. We also conduct additional experiments to shed light on the key components of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Model Uncertainty in Evolutionary Optimization and Bayesian Optimization: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box optimization problems, which are common in many real-world applications, require optimization through input-output interactions without access to internal workings. This often leads to significant computational resources being consumed for simulations. Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (SAEA) are two widely used gradient-free optimization techniques employed to address such challenges. Both approaches follow a similar iterative procedure that relies on surrogate models to guide the search process. This paper aims to elucidate the similarities and differences in the utilization of model uncertainty between these two methods, as well as the impact of model inaccuracies on algorithmic performance. A novel model-assisted strategy is introduced, which utilizes unevaluated solutions to generate offspring, leveraging the population-based search capabilities of evolutionary algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of model-assisted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms mainstream Bayesian optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by varied social cognitive challenges and repetitive behavioral patterns. Identifying reliable brain imaging-based biomarkers for ASD has been a persistent challenge due to the spectrum's diverse symptomatology. Existing baselines in the field have made significant strides in this direction, yet there remains room for improvement in both performance and interpretability. We propose \emph{HyperGALE}, which builds upon the hypergraph by incorporating learned hyperedges and gated attention mechanisms. This approach has led to substantial improvements in the model's ability to interpret complex brain graph data, offering deeper insights into ASD biomarker characterization. Evaluated on the extensive ABIDE II dataset, \emph{HyperGALE} not only improves interpretability but also demonstrates statistically significant enhancements in key performance metrics compared to both previous baselines and the foundational hypergraph model. The advancement \emph{HyperGALE} brings to ASD research highlights the potential of sophisticated graph-based techniques in neurodevelopmental studies.

      <title>PyVRP: a high-performance VRP solver package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce PyVRP, a Python package that implements hybrid genetic search in a state-of-the-art vehicle routing problem (VRP) solver. The package is designed for the VRP with time windows (VRPTW), but can be easily extended to support other VRP variants. PyVRP combines the flexibility of Python with the performance of C++, by implementing (only) performance critical parts of the algorithm in C++, while being fully customisable at the Python level. PyVRP is a polished implementation of the algorithm that ranked 1st in the 2021 DIMACS VRPTW challenge and, after improvements, ranked 1st on the static variant of the EURO meets NeurIPS 2022 vehicle routing competition. The code follows good software engineering practices, and is well-documented and unit tested. PyVRP is freely available under the liberal MIT license. Through numerical experiments we show that PyVRP achieves state-of-the-art results on the VRPTW and capacitated VRP. We hope that PyVRP enables researchers and practitioners to easily and quickly build on a state-of-the-art VRP solver.</description>

      <title>From Tempered to Benign Overfitting in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks (NNs) are observed to generalize well even when trained to perfectly fit noisy data. This phenomenon motivated a large body of work on "benign overfitting", where interpolating predictors achieve near-optimal performance. Recently, it was conjectured and empirically observed that the behavior of NNs is often better described as "tempered overfitting", where the performance is non-optimal yet also non-trivial, and degrades as a function of the noise level. However, a theoretical justification of this claim for non-linear NNs has been lacking so far. In this work, we provide several results that aim at bridging these complementing views. We study a simple classification setting with 2-layer ReLU NNs, and prove that under various assumptions, the type of overfitting transitions from tempered in the extreme case of one-dimensional data, to benign in high dimensions. Thus, we show that the input dimension has a crucial role on the type of overfitting in this setting, which we also validate empirically for intermediate dimensions. Overall, our results shed light on the intricate connections between the dimension, sample size, architecture and training algorithm on the one hand, and the type of resulting overfitting on the other hand.</description>

      <title>Generalized Early Stopping in Evolutionary Direct Policy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lengthy evaluation times are common in many optimization problems such as direct policy search tasks, especially when they involve conducting evaluations in the physical world, e.g. in robotics applications. Often when evaluating solution over a fixed time period it becomes clear that the objective value will not increase with additional computation time (for example when a two wheeled robot continuously spins on the spot). In such cases, it makes sense to stop the evaluation early to save computation time. However, most approaches to stop the evaluation are problem specific and need to be specifically designed for the task at hand. Therefore, we propose an early stopping method for direct policy search. The proposed method only looks at the objective value at each time step and requires no problem specific knowledge. We test the introduced stopping criterion in five direct policy search environments drawn from games, robotics and classic control domains, and show that it can save up to 75% of the computation time. We also compare it with problem specific stopping criteria and show that it performs comparably, while being more generally applicable.</description>
