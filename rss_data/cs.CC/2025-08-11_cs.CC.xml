      <title>On the Classical Hardness of the Semidirect Discrete Logarithm Problem in Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) in finite groups was proposed as a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic protocols, based on the belief that its non-abelian structure would resist quantum attacks. However, recent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum algorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental question: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard discrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work, we investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group platforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a generalized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical algorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity $O(\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we demonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent and does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in elliptic curves $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded automorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the SDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue structure of the automorphism. Our findings reveal that the non-abelian structure of semidirect products does not inherently guarantee increased classical hardness, suggesting that the search for classically hard problems for cryptographic applications requires more careful consideration of the underlying algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>The vast world of quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to identify quantum advantages lies at the heart of quantum technology. While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision, distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation, learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties: predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee. While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.</description>

      <title>On the Parallel Complexity of Identifying Groups and Quasigroups via Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity of isomorphism testing for finite groups and quasigroups, given by their multiplication tables. We crucially take advantage of their various decompositions to show the following:
  - We first consider the class $\mathcal{C}$ of groups that admit direct product decompositions, where each indecompsable factor is $O(1)$-generated, and either perfect or centerless. We show any group in $\mathcal{C}$ is identified by the $O(1)$-dimensional count-free Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) algorithm with $O(\log \log n)$ rounds, and the $O(1)$-dimensional counting WL algorithm with $O(1)$ rounds. Consequently, the isomorphism problem for $\mathcal{C}$ is in $\textsf{L}$. The previous upper bound for this class was $\textsf{TC}^{1}$, using $O(\log n)$ rounds of the $O(1)$-dimensional counting WL (Grochow and Levet, FCT 2023).
  - We next consider more generally, the class of groups where each indecomposable factor is $O(1)$-generated. We exhibit an $\textsf{AC}^{3}$ canonical labeling procedure for this class. Here, we accomplish this by showing that in the multiplication table model, the direct product decomposition can be computed in $\textsf{AC}^{3}$, parallelizing the work of Kayal and Nezhmetdinov (ICALP 2009).
  - Isomorphism testing between a central quasigroup $G$ and an arbitrary quasigroup $H$ is in $\textsf{NC}$. Here, we take advantage of the fact that central quasigroups admit an affine decomposition in terms of an underlying Abelian group. Only the trivial bound of $n^{\log(n)+O(1)}$-time was previously known for isomorphism testing of central quasigroups.</description>

      <title>Reducibility among NP-Hard graph problems and boundary classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many NP-hard graph problems become easy for some classes of graphs. For example, coloring is easy for bipartite graphs, but NP-hard in general. So we can ask question like when does a hard problem become easy? What is the minimum substructure for which the problem remains hard? We use the notion of boundary classes to study such questions. In this paper, we introduce a method for transforming the boundary class of one NP-hard graph problem into a boundary class for another problem. If {\Pi} and {\Gamma} are two NP-hard graph problems where {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, we transform a boundary class of {\Pi} into a boundary class of {\Gamma}. More formally if {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, where the reduction satisfies certain conditions, then X is a boundary class of {\Pi} if and only if the image of X under the reduction is a boundary class of {\Gamma}. This gives us a relationship between boundary classes and reducibility among several NP-hard problems. To show the strength of our main result, we apply our theorem to obtain some previously unknown boundary classes for a few graph problems namely; vertex-cover, clique, traveling-salesperson, bounded-degree-spanning-tree, subgraph-isomorphism and clique-cover.</description>

      <title>On coloring graphs with well-distributed edge density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of graphs which we call average hereditary graphs. Many graphs that occur in the usual graph theory applications belong to this class of graphs. Many popular types of graphs fall under this class, such as regular graphs, trees and other popular classes of graphs. The paper aims to explore some interesting properties regarding colorings average hereditary graphs. We prove a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of its maximum average degree and show that this bound is an improvement on previous bounds. From this, we show a relationship between the average degree and the chromatic number of an average hereditary graph. We then show that even with new bound, the graph 3-coloring problem remains NP-hard when the input is restricted to average hereditary graphs. We provide an equivalent condition for a graph to be average hereditary, through which we show that we can decide if a given graph is average hereditary in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Orbit-blocking words in free groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By strengthening known results about primitivity-blocking words in free groups, we prove that for any nontrivial element w of a free group of finite rank, there are words that cannot be subwords of any cyclically reduced automorphic image of w. This has implications for the average-case complexity of a variant of Whitehead's problem.</description>

      <title>Quon Classical Simulation: Unifying Cliffords, Matchgates and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework of topological complexity to study the computational complexity of quantum circuits and tensor networks. Within this framework, we establish the Quon Classical Simulation (QCS) for hybrid Clifford-Matchgate circuits, which is efficient for both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits, therefore answering a long standing open question on unifying efficient classical simulations. This framework is built upon the Quon language, a 2+1D topological quantum field theory with space-time boundary and defects. Its exponential computation complexity is captured by Magic holes, a topological feature capturing the global long-range entanglement. Both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of Magic holes. Efficient classical simulations of Cliffords and Matchgates are implemented by two parallel operations, generalized surgery theory of 3-manifolds and Yang-Baxter relations on the 2D boundary respectively, with additional binary arithmetic properties.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Substitution Basis for the Kalmar Elementary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the class of Kalmar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>
