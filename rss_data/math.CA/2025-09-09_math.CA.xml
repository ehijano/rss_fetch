      <title>Maximizers of the $L^2\to L^4$ Fourier extension inequality for cones in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharp Fourier restriction theory and finite field extension theory have both been topics of interest in the last decades. Very recently, in \cite{GonzalezOliveira}, the research into the intersection of these two topics started. There it was established that, for the $(3,1)$-cone $\Gamma_{(3,1)}^3:=\{\boldsymbol{\eta}\in \mathbb{F}_q^4\setminus\{\boldsymbol{0}\} : \eta_1^2+\eta_2^2+\eta_3^2=\eta_4^2\},$ the Fourier extension map from $L^2\to L^{4}$ is maximized by constant functions when $q=3\, \pmod{4}$. In this manuscript, we advance this line of inquiry by establishing sharp inequalities for the $L^{2}\to L^{4}$ extension inequalities applicable for all remaining cones $\Gamma^3\subset \mathbb{F}_q^4$. These cones include the $(2,2)$-cone $\Gamma_{(2,2)}^3:=\{\boldsymbol{\eta}\in \mathbb{F}_q^4\setminus\{\boldsymbol{0}\} : \eta_1^2+\eta_2^2=\eta_3^2+\eta_4^2\}$ for general $q=p^n$ and the $(3,1)$-cone when $q=1\, \pmod{4}$. Moreover, we classify all the extremizers in each case. We note that the analogous problem for the (2, 2)-cone in the euclidean setting remains open.</description>

      <title>$q$-analogues of $\pi$-formulas due to Ramanujan and Guillera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first known $q$-analogues for any of the $17$ formulas for $\frac{1}{\pi}$ due to Ramanujan were introduced in 2018 by Guo and Liu (J. Difference Equ. Appl. 29:505-513, 2018), via the $q$-Wilf-Zeilberger method. Through a "normalization" method, which we refer to as EKHAD-normalization, based on the $q$-polynomial coefficients involved in first-order difference equations obtained from the $q$-version of Zeilberger's algorithm, we introduce $q$-WZ pairs that extend WZ pairs introduced by Guillera (Adv. in Appl. Math. 29:599-603, 2002) (Ramanujan J. 11:41-48, 2006). We apply our EKHAD-normalization method to prove four new $q$-analogues for three of Ramanujan's formulas for $\frac{1}{\pi}$ along with $q$-analogues of Guillera's first two series for $\frac{1}{\pi^2}$. Our normalization method does not seem to have been previously considered in any equivalent way in relation to $q$-series, and this is substantiated through our survey on previously known $q$-analogues of Ramanujan-type series for $\frac{1}{\pi}$ and of Guillera's series for $\frac{1}{\pi^2}$. We conclude by showing how our method can be adapted to further extend Guillera's WZ pairs by introducing hypergeometric expansions for $\frac{1}{\pi^2}$.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering problem for a cubic string having the shape of a step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem for a cubic string having the shape of a step is studied. It is proved that here we have two scattering problems: the direct one and its dual. The direct problem describes scattering of the waves coming from ``$+\infty$'', and its dual, correspondingly, of the waves from ``$-\infty$''. The main systems of linear singular equations for both problems are obtained. It is shown how to unambiguously restore potential from the solutions to these equation systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic lower-dimensional Minkowski content and $\mathcal{S}$-content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the lower-dimensional anisotropic Minkowski content and $\mathcal{S}$-content. We establish that these anisotropic contents exhibit properties analogous to their isotropic counterparts by proving analogous inequalities between the lower-dimensional anisotropic Minkowski content and $\mathcal{S}$-content $\mathcal{S}$-content. A key component of our approach is demonstrating that the associated anisotropic volume function is of Kneser type, a result that underpins many of our proofs. In addition, we introduce anisotropic versions of the Minkowski and $\mathcal{S}$-dimensions and derive inequalities relating them. As an application, we analyze the existence of the $log_2(3)$-dimensional anisotropic Minkowski and $\mathcal{S}$-contents of the Sierpinski gasket.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain multidimensional metric uniform distribution results involving sequences in ${\mathbb R}^k$ parametrized by analytic curves. Our theorems extend the classical theorems of Weyl and Koksma in a variety of ways.
  One of our main results implies that for any injective sequences $a_1,\dots,a_k:{\mathbb N}\to{\mathbb Z}$ the set
  $$\Big\{(x_1,\dots,x_k)\in{\mathbb R}^k:\big(a_1(n)x_1,\dots,a_k(n)x_k\big)_{n\in{\mathbb N}}\text{ is uniformly distributed in }{\mathbb T}^k\Big\}$$
  has full Lebesgue measure inside any non-degenerate analytic curve $\gamma\subset{\mathbb R}^k$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Two Species with Density-Dependent Interactions in a Mutualistic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutualistic interactions, where individuals from different species can benefit from each other, are widespread across ecosystems. This study develops a general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming that mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting individuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two species. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing the ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when the respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary differential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general principles governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the emergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit cycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in strictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for characterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights the effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density dependence.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks: From Theory to Simulation of Interconnected Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new framework integrating port-Hamiltonian systems (PHS) and neural network architectures. This framework bridges the gap between deterministic and stochastic modeling of complex dynamical systems. We introduce new mathematical formulations and computational methods that expand the geometric structure of PHS to account for uncertainty, environmental noise, and random perturbations. Building on these advances, we introduce stochastic port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs), which facilitate the accurate learning and prediction of non-autonomous and interconnected stochastic systems. Our proposed framework generalizes passivity concepts to the stochastic regime, ensuring stability while maintaining the system's energy-consistent structure. Extensive simulations, including those involving damped mass-spring systems, Duffing oscillators, and robotic control tasks, demonstrate the capability of pHNNs to capture complex dynamics with high fidelity, even under noise and uncertainty. This unified approach establishes a foundation for the robust, data-driven modeling and control of nonlinear stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>On uniform summability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a nonempty set of infinite matrices of linear operators between two topological vector spaces. We show that a sequence is uniformly $\mathscr{A}$-summable if and only if it is $B$-summable for all matrices $B$ of linear operators such that the $n$th row of $B$ is the $n$th row for some $A \in \mathscr{A}$. This extends the main result of Bell in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 38 (1973), 548--552]. We also provide several applications including uniform versions of Silverman--Toeplitz theorem, characterizations of almost regular matrices, uniform superior limits, and inclusion of ideal cores. Basically, our methods allow to translate ordinary results into their uniform versions, using directly the former ones.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the possible bifurcations of periodic orbits by reducing them to graphs. The aforementioned allows to study the genericity of routes to chaos, as well as to analyze their possible complexity. In particular, our results show that there is no upper bound on the possible complexity. Moreover, it suggests general fermionic description via the virial expansion and universal description via the Rado graph.</description>

      <title>From Lipschitz embedding to Lipschitz equivalence between dust-like self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K,F\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be two dust-like self-similar sets sharing the same Hausdorff dimension. We consider when the mere existence of a Lipschitz embedding from $K$ to $F$ already implies their Lipschitz equivalence. Our main result is threefold: (1) if the Lipschitz image of $K$ intersects $F$ in a set of positive Hausdorff measure, then $K$ admits a Lipschitz surjection onto $F$; (2) if $F$ is in addition homogeneous, then the generating iterated function systems of $K, F$ should have algebraically dependent ratios and consequently, $K$ and $F$ are Lipschitz equivalent; (3) the Lipschitz equivalence can fail without the homogeneity assumption. This answers two questions in Balka and Keleti [Adv. Math. 446 (2024), 109669].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is said to be spectral if $L^2(\Omega)$ admits an orthogonal basis of exponentials. While the product of spectral sets is known to be spectral, the converse fails in general. In this paper, we prove that the converse holds when one factor is a perturbation of an interval: if $E \subset [0,3/2 - \epsilon]$ and $F$ are bounded sets of measure $1$, then $E \times F$ is spectral if and only if both $E$ and $F$ are spectral.</description>

Abstract: We establish sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for H\"ormander operators with positive-definite Carleson--Sj\"olin phases and for spectral projectors on smooth, compact Riemannian manifolds. As an application, we obtain sharp $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the aforementioned H\"ormander operators in odd dimensions, thereby completing the analysis in the odd-dimensional case. Further applications include $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the Fourier extension operator, $L^p$ estimates for the Bochner--Riesz operator, microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions, and $L^p$ estimates for Hecke--Maass forms on compact $3$-dimensional arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. One of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that \[|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.\] This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0&lt;x\le y&lt;2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)&gt;0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</description>

      <title>Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, stochastic algorithms have emerged as scalable and efficient tools for solving large-scale ill-posed inverse problems by randomly selecting subsets of equations at each iteration. However, due to the ill-posedness and measurement noise, these methods often suffer from oscillations and semi-convergence behavior, posing challenges in achieving stable and accurate reconstructions. This study proposes a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach, the iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) to address nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method tends to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori information of the noise level. We show that the method terminatesinfinitelymanystepsincaseofnoisydataandhasregularizingfeatures. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical efficacy of the method.</description>
