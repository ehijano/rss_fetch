      <title>The Surface Orientation Ambiguity for Single Molecules at Dielectric Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescent molecules emit light in a dipole radiation pattern that can be used to infer their orientation through defocused fluorescence microscopy. Proper measurement of the orientation requires mathematical modeling of the radiation pattern expected for a dipole in the geometry of interest, and subsequent comparison against experimental data. We point out an ambiguity in common calculations of these patterns that appears to compromise orientation measurements for molecules that are especially near to dielectric surfaces. This results in a rotation of the measured emission dipole toward the surface for near-interface molecules, which can be mistaken for a preferentially horizontal orientation among the emitters. The proper treatment for on-surface emitters requires consideration of finite-sized current elements between two dielectric media, and we show that the theoretical ambiguity can be lifted via finite-element modeling. A prescription is provided for correcting measured orientations at arbitrary interfaces.</description>

      <title>Holovibes: real-time ultrahigh-speed digital hologram rendering and short-time analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time ultrahigh-speed rendering of digital holograms from high-bitrate interferogram streams demands robust parallel computing and efficient data handling with minimal latency. We present Holovibes, a high-performance software engine that enables real-time holographic image reconstruction and short-time analysis at unprecedented throughput. Holovibes integrates spatial demodulation techniques, such as Fresnel transformations and angular spectrum propagation, with temporal analysis methods including short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and principal component analysis (PCA) in a unified pipeline. By leveraging CUDA-based GPU acceleration, multithreaded parallelism, and efficient buffering, the system achieves high-throughput, low-latency processing suitable for demanding computational imaging applications. We demonstrate sustained real-time hologram rendering of 256x256-pixel from interferograms acquired by a streaming camera at 71,400 frames per second on commodity hardware with no frame loss, while maintaining an end-to-end latency of 30 ms. The engine also supports simultaneous recording of raw or processed data, enabling high-speed acquisition workflows essential for experimental applications. This work represents a significant advance over prior digital holography systems and provides a versatile platform for ultra-high-speed, real-time computational imaging.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption of a Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ (CTS) layer trapped by metallic thin films in multilayer configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coating and reflecting thin films for energy harvesting purposes are interesting topics in both theoretical and experimental research. The thin film could help to enhance the absorption of the system via its specific optical properties depending on the optical wavelength and the stacked layer thickness. Here, by using Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields penetrating thin films, we examined in detail the absorption of a CTS layer coated by nanometer-thick thin films of several materials, Au, Ag, Cu, Al, and figured out the optimal thickness range for the outer layers of the solar cell to optimize thermal energy harvesting from the light. In particular, the absorption has been shown to be significantly enhanced thanks to the optical cavity effect, and the maximal absorption of the system could reach 60\% for ... These results could help in suitably choosing the detailed thickness for the structure of the solar cell and other energy harvesting objects.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description>

      <title>Tight-binding photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics, dealing with the generation, manipulation, and detection of photons in various systems, lays the foundation of many advanced technologies. A key task of photonics is to know how photons propagate in complex media such as periodic and aperiodic photonic crystals. The conventional wisdom is to numerically solve the Maxwell equations either by dedicated numerical techniques or brute-force finite-element calculations. Recently, the strict analogy between photonic crystals and theoretical tight-binding models provides an unprecedentedly convenient wayof understanding the spectra and wavefunctions of photonic systems by mapping the complicated differential equationsinto matrixed Hamiltonians that can be easily solved through the band theory and exact diagonalization. in this paper, we present a timely review of tight-binding-like photonics in various platforms, covering fundamental theories, experimental realizations, unique physical efiects, and their potential applications. We also provide a brief outlook on the future trends of this active area. Our review offers an in-depth and comprehensive picture on this rapidly developing field and may shed light on the future design on advanced tight-binding-like photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Laser Driven Bulk-to-Layered Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced phase transitions offer pathways of phase transitions that are inaccessible by conventional stimuli. In this study, we conduct ab initio simulations to numerically demonstrate a novel laser-induced structural transformation: converting a bulk crystal into a layered van der Waals material using intense light pulses. The transition is driven by a nonlinear phononic mechanism, where selectively exciting polar and anti-polar phonon modes with polarized terahertz light breaks targeted interlayer bonds while preserving intralayer ones. We identify that strong anisotropy in bond sensitivity where interlayer bonds are significantly more susceptible to excitation than intralayer bonds is the critical prerequisite. Our findings pave the way for on demand transformations from bulk to 2D materials, facilitate the design of advanced phase-change devices, and suggest a potential optical exfoliation method to expand the range of exfoliable 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of quantum dots in GaAs-on-insulator waveguides for coherent single-photon generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of coherent quantum emitters with silicon photonic platforms essential for scalable quantum technologies. We demonstrate electrically controlled self-assembled quantum dots embedded in GaAs waveguides bonded onto a SiO2/Si substrate and coupled to low-loss SiN waveguides. Our approach uses a die-to-die adhesive bonding process to realize a GaAs-on-insulator platform incorporating a p-i-n junction for charge noise suppression and Stark tuning of excitonic transitions. Resonance fluorescence measurements reveal narrow optical linewidths below 2 {\mu}eV and high single-photon purity, matching the performance of unprocessed GaAs devices. These results establish a practical route to integrate high-coherence quantum light sources with mature silicon photonics, enabling scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Propagation Length of Graphene Surface Plasmon Polaritons using a Metamaterial Substrate with a Near-Zero Refractive Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the conditions necessary to control, enhance, and modify the propagation length of graphene surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at room temperature, using an all-dielectric metamaterial substrate in comparison to suspended graphene. The analysis is conducted within a photonic crystal framework using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 to study the resonant modes of the all-dielectric metamaterial. Our results confirm the existence of an near-zero effective refractive index (NZERI) regime at the $\Gamma\text{-point}$ point in the photonic crystal approach. At this NZERI regime a consequence of triply degenerate eigenmodes in a certain frequency range occurs when the effective refractive index of the metasurface approaches zero. Our central idea is that the NZERI regime in the all-dielectric metasurface of a graphene substrate can be used to control, enhance, and modify the propagation of SPPs. We applied several independent theoretical methods to obtain the effective refractive index of the metasurface at NZERI frequency range for two-dimensional and three-dimensional metasurface structures with a graphene layer. Simulation results demonstrate that the effective permittivity and permeability simultaneously attain near-zero values at closely spaced yet distinct frequencies, thereby establishing spectral regions with an effectively vanishing refractive index. Key contributions include the first demonstration of NZERI metasurfaces as graphene-supporting platforms for enhancing SPPs, a quantitative approach to balancing propagation distance and field confinement, and practical design guidelines that align with current nanofabrication capabilities. Our simulations further demonstrate that when graphene is placed on (or between two) all-dielectric metasurfaces operating in the NZERI regime, the SPP propagation length can be significantly increased.</description>

      <title>Broadband Dipole Absorption in Dispersive Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic media modulated periodically in time, termed photonic time crystals (PTCs), have attracted considerable attention for their ability to open momentum bandgaps hosting amplifying modes. These momentum gaps, however, generally appear only at the system's parametric resonance condition which constrain many features derived from amplification to a narrow frequency band. Moreover, they are accompanied by exceptional points (EPs) that render their analysis more intricate. Here, we show that a careful consideration of dispersion and absorption can overcome these issues. By investigating the dissipated power of a point-dipole embedded in a dispersive and absorptive PTC, we unveil that temporal modulation enables the conversion of dipole emission into dipole absorption within a broadband frequency window free of EPs. We demonstrate that this effect is general and occurs from weak modulation strengths to low modulation frequencies, and can be achieved for various material platforms. Moreover, we show the possibility of both broadband inhibition and large increase of dissipated power, depending on the modulated parameter.</description>

      <title>Calculating Vibronic Spectra with a linear algorithm based on Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately simulating molecular vibronic spectra remains computationally challenging due to the exponential scaling of required calculations. Here, we show that employing the linear coupling model within the gaussian boson sampling framework effectively addresses this limitation. We implement the algorithm for simulating the pentacene molecule through three distinct approaches, using numerical simulation on a classical computer and experimentally using two optical setups equipped with different photon detectors (SNSPD and SPAD). High fidelity $(F&gt;0.999)$ was achieved between the simulated Franck-Condon profiles and analytically calculated profiles obtained by enumerating all possible transitions within the linear coupling model. Furthermore, simulations were performed for larger molecular systems using 48 vibrational modes of naphthalene and 64 vibrational modes of anthracene. Comparison with experimental data confirms that the simulated spectra accurately reproduce both the positions and shapes of the measured spectral bands. A notable advantage of our algorithm is its scalability, requiring only a fixed minimal set of optical components irrespective of the size of the studied system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilized optical frequency references (OFRs) are indispensable for atom-based quantum technologies, optical communications, and precision metrology. As these systems become more sophisticated, demands for compactness, robustness, and straightforward reproduction have grown. In this work, we present a robust 19-inch rack-mountable OFR module designed via a web-based CAD workflow that allows straightforward redistribution and reproduction. Its optical subsystem, designed based on a modeled laser beam path, places optical elements with sub-millimeter accuracy on a custom-machined aluminum plate, allowing straightforward assembly without extensive alignment and providing high mechanical stability. The module maintains frequency-stable operation for several months without user intervention and exhibits high robustness to mechanical vibrations up to 4g. All design files, including mechanical and optical metadata, are openly shared for straightforward reproduction and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Efficient detection of spectrally multimode squeezed light through optical parametric amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum-enhanced sensing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. Efficient detection of such a multimode squeezed state is essential for unlocking its full potential. Optical parametric amplification (OPA) has recently gained attention as a powerful technique offering loss-tolerant, direct broadband detection, and multimode operation. While OPA has been used to characterize spatially multimode squeezing, its application to spectrally multimode squeezing has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report on the first experimental demonstration of spectrally multimode squeezing detection using OPA. We achieve simultaneous detection of squeezing across more than 60 spectral modes of a broadband squeezed vacuum state. The observed squeezing is nearly uniform, ranging from -6.5 to -7 dB, which makes the source particularly suitable for constructing continuous-variable cluster states, and indicates the multimode capability of the OPA. The results extend the capabilities of OPA detection into the spectral domain, advancing spectral-mode-based high-dimensional photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving low-latency time-reversal of broadband radiofrequency signals is crucial for reliable communications in dynamic, uncontrolled environments. However, existing approaches are either digitally assisted -- making broadband extension challenging -- or limited to amplitude modulation. In this work, we report the very first experimental realization of a fully analog, phase-preserving time-reversal architecture for optically-carried radiofrequency signals. The method exploits the exceptional coherence properties of rare-earth ion-doped materials, and leverages the well-established photon echo mechanism, widely used in quantum technologies. While our demonstration is conducted with a modest bandwidth, we identify the fundamental cause of this limitation and propose solutions for future scalability.</description>

      <title>Optical microcavity characterization via resonance spectra and modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes how resonance spectra and mode profiles can be used to characterize and quantify the mode-shaping effects in open-access plano-concave optical microcavities. The presented semi-analytic theory is based on the application of perturbation theory to the roundtrip evolution of the optical field. It includes various mirror-shape and nonparaxial effects and extends the nonparaxial theory presented by van Exter et al. (2022, Phys. Rev. A 106, 013501) and verified by Koks et al. (2022, Phys. Rev. A 105, 063502) to the common case of an anisotropic Gaussian mirror. The presented measurements and analyses of resonance spectra and mode profiles demonstrate how the different mode-shaping effects can be individually distinguished and quantified. Spin-orbit coupling, which is one of the nonparaxial effects, is prominently visible in the intriguing polarization patterns of the resonant modes, while polarization tomography yields the shape-induced birefringence and associated polarization splitting of the fundamental modes.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in cold atom interferometry have facilitated the practical application of quantum inertial sensors. To mitigate the detrimental effects of operating in dynamic environments, optical or magnetic atom guides are essential for transverse confinement. One notable approach involves the use of evanescent field (EF) optical dipole traps as atom guides (i.e. EF atom guides). In this study, we first investigated the feasibility of EF atom guides using nanofiber testbeds for application in photonic integrated circuits (PICs). We successfully demonstrated EF atom guiding with traveling evanescent waves and validated the atomic coherence of EF-guided atoms through microwave fields and fiber-guided sub-microwatt EF Doppler-free Raman beams. Our low-power EF atom guides, based on nanofiber testbeds, utilize 793 and 937 nm light to trap 133Cs atoms. This approach reduces power requirements to &lt;10mW, enabling easier thermal management in vacuum environments. These wavelengths were also selected to facilitate the integration of EF atom guides on membrane PIC platforms, which we previously demonstrated with a suspended membrane waveguide capable of handling in-vacuum optical powers suitable for EF atom guiding (Gehl et al., Opt. Express 29, 13129, 2021). Our design includes an open hole in a transparent membrane, which facilitates the loading of sub-Doppler cooled atoms using a membrane magneto-optical trap (Lee et al., Sci. Rep. 11, 8807, 2021). These developments offer a unique path for integrating EF atom guides on the PIC platforms. All these findings represent a significant first step toward EF-guided atom interferometry and the first demonstration of chip-scale quantum inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</description>
