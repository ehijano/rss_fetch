      <title>Entanglement Evolution of Noisy Quantum Systems: Master Equation-TFD Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Thermofield Dynamics (TFD) is applied to map a quantum optics nonlinear master equation into a Schrodinger-like equation for any arbitrary initial condition. This formalism provides a more efficient way for solving open quantum system problems. Then we use the Hartree-Fock approximation to solve the master equations of two separate noisy quantum systems analytically, which allows us to analyze the entanglement and quantum mutual information in each case using the eigenvalues of a covariance matrix, followed by two-mode and single-mode squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for permutation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different algorithms are presented for generating a quantum circuit realization of a matrix representing a permutation on $2^n$ letters. All circuits involve $n$ qubits and only use multi--controlled Toffoli gates. The first algorithm constructs a circuit from any decomposition of the permutation into a product of transpositions, but uses one ancilla line. The second, which uses no ancillae, constructs a circuit from a decomposition into a product of transpositions that have a Hamming distance of one. We show that any permutation admits such a decomposition, and we give a strategy for reducing the number of transpositions involved.</description>

      <title>Holographic Representation of One-Dimensional Many-Body Quantum States via Isometric Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) allow for efficient and accurate simulations of higher-dimensional quantum systems by enforcing an isometric structure. We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary "holographic" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ans\"atze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime.</description>

      <title>Uniform matrix product states with a boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical forms are central to the analytical understanding of tensor network states, underpinning key results such as the complete classification of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases within the matrix product state (MPS) framework. Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Cumulant Expansion and Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Weakly Interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function of weakly interacting fermions with polynomial runtime in both the system size and precision. Although weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for many computational methods such as the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, a mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime has been lacking. In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime.</description>

      <title>Cavity Mediated Two-Qubit Gate: Tuning to Optimal Performance with NISQ Era Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of photon-mediated operations are critical to the realization of scalable quantum information processing platforms and their accurate characterization is essential for the identification of optimal regimes and their experimental realizations. Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced biosensing enables earlier detection of bacterial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid detection of bacterial growth is crucial in clinical, food safety, and environmental contexts, yet conventional optical methods are limited by noise and require hours of incubation. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of a quantum-enhanced photometric measurement for early bacterial detection using squeezed light. By monitoring the optical absorbance of an Escherichia coli culture with a quantum probe, we achieve a sensitivity beyond the shot-noise limit, enabling identification of growth onset up to 30 minutes earlier than with a classical sensor. The noise reduction is validated through statistical modeling with a truncated Gaussian distribution and hypothesis testing, confirming earlier detection with low false-alarm rates. This work illustrates how quantum resources can improve real-time, non-invasive diagnostics. Our results pave the way for quantum-enhanced biosensors that accelerate detection of microbial growth and other biological processes without increasing photodamage.</description>

      <title>TreeVQA: A Tree-Structured Execution Framework for Shot Reduction in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising for near- and intermediate-term quantum computing, but their execution cost is substantial. Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications. Evaluations on scientific and combinatorial benchmarks show shot count reductions of $25.9\times$ on average and over $100\times$ for large-scale problems at the same target accuracy. The benefits grow further with increasing problem size and precision requirements.</description>

      <title>Proof of Spin-Statistics Theorem in Quantum Mechanics of Identical Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonrelativistic proof of the spin-statistics theorem is given in terms of the field operators satisfying commutation and anticommutation relations, which are introduced here in the coordinate space as a means to build the permutation symmetry into the brackets of identical particles. An eigenvalue problem of a $\pi$-rotation for a product of two annihilation operators is combined with an analysis on its rotational property to prove the connection that the field operators for integral-spin and half-integral-spin particles obey the commutation and anticommutation relations, respectively.</description>

      <title>The PPKN Gate: An Optimal 1-Toffoli Input-Preserving Full Adder for Quantum Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12073v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient arithmetic operations are a prerequisite for practical quantum computing. Optimization efforts focus on two primary metrics: Quantum Cost (QC), determined by the number of non-linear gates, and Logical Depth, which defines the execution speed. Existing literature identifies the HNG gate as the standard for Input-Preserving Reversible Full Adders. HNG gate typically requires a QC of 12 and a logical depth of 5, in the area of classical reversible circuits. This paper proposes the PPKN Gate, a novel design that achieves the same inputpreserving functionality using only one Toffoli gate and five CNOT gates. With a Quantum Cost of 10 and a reduced logical depth of 4, the PPKN gate outperforms the standard HNG gate in both complexity and speed. Furthermore, we present a modular architecture for constructing an n-bit Ripple Carry Adder by cascading PPKN modules.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Symmetry Merging in Pauli Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Dilemmas in Quantum Computing for Chemistry: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry adaptation, universality, and gate efficiency are central but often competing requirements in quantum algorithms for electronic structure and many-body physics. For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse. Together, the formal and numerical analysis provides a practical guide for designing and benchmarking symmetry-adapted operator pools that balance universality, resource requirements, and robust state targeting in quantum simulations for chemistry.</description>

      <title>Measurement as Sheafification: Context, Logic, and Truth after Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12249v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurement is commonly posed as a dynamical tension between linear Schr\"odinger evolution and an ad hoc collapse rule. I argue that the deeper conflict is logical: quantum theory is inherently contextual, whereas the classical tradition presupposes a single global, Boolean valuation. Building on Bohr's complementarity, the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen argument and Bell's theorem, I recast locality and completeness as the existence of a global section of a presheaf of value assignments over the category of measurement contexts. The absence of global sections expresses the impossibility of context-independent description, and \v{C}ech cohomology measures the resulting obstruction. The internal logic of the presheaf topos is intuitionistic, and the seven-valued contextual logic proposed by Ghose and Patra is exhibited as a finite Heyting algebra capturing patterns of truth, falsity and indeterminacy across incompatible contexts. Classical physics corresponds to the sheaf case, where compatible local data glue and Boolean logic is effectively restored. Measurement is therefore reinterpreted as sheafification of presheaf-valued truth rather than as a physical breakdown of unitarity. Finally, a $\sigma$--$\lambda$ dynamics motivated by stochastic mechanics provides a continuous interpolation between strongly contextual and approximately classical regimes, dissolving the usual measurement paradoxes and apparent nonlocality as artefacts of an illegitimate demand for global truth.</description>

      <title>Coherence Dispersion and Temperature Scales in a Quantum-Biology Toy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how quantum coherence can scatter among the several off-diagonal elements of an arbitrary quantum state, defining coherence dispersion ($\Delta_{\rm c}$). It turns out that this easily computable quantity is maximized for intermediate values of an appropriate entropy, a prevalent signature of complexity quantifiers across different fields, from linguistics and information science to evolutionary biology. By focusing on out-of-equilibrium systems, we use the developed framework to address a simplified model of cellular energetics, involving remanent coherence. Within the context of this model, the precise energy of 30.5 kJ/mol (the yield of ATP-ADP conversion) causes the temperature range where $\Delta_{\rm c}$ is maximized to be compatible with temperatures for which unicellular life is reported to exist. Low levels of coherence suffice to support this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Imaging Walk-Off Driven Distortions in EPR Photon Pair Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is the primary source of position-correlated and momentum-anticorrelated photon pairs that form the canonical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state. Their transverse spatial correlations are usually analyzed within the thin-crystal approximation, where the two-photon wavefunction is assumed to factorize into independent functions of the sum and difference coordinates. In practice, however, birefringence-induced transverse walk-off breaks this factorization and couples these degrees of freedom. Here, we show that this coupling persists even for nominally thin crystals once the free-space propagation of the joint spatial intensity is taken into account. This sum-difference coordinate coupling leads to a distinctive tapering of the transverse correlations near the crystal image plane-an effect that standard factorized models cannot capture. Numerical simulations and experimental data clearly confirm this novel behavior. Our findings provide a more complete description of photon-pair generation in birefringent nonlinear media and clarify fundamental limits on spatially resolved quantum imaging and spatial-mode quantum information processing with EPR states.</description>

      <title>Classical Second-Order Moments and Tensor Squeezing in Spin-1 Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a compact, frame-independent characterization of the set of classical second-order moments for a single spin-1 particle. Defining the moment matrix M = 2Q + (1/3) I, we show that a moment pair (s, Q) arises from a positive mixture of spin-coherent states if and only if M is positive semidefinite, M minus ss^T is positive semidefinite, and the trace of M equals one. These necessary and sufficient matrix conditions delimit the classical moment region and yield simple, basis-free witnesses of higher-order tensor nonclassicality, such as bounds on Tr(Q^2). A constructive proof of sufficiency is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Encoding Strategies for Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) offer a promising architecture for near-term quantum machine learning by combining hierarchical feature extraction with modest parameter growth. However, any QCNN operating on classical data must rely on an encoding scheme to embed inputs into quantum states, and this choice can dominate both performance and resource requirements. This work presents an implementation-level comparison of three representative encodings -- Angle, Amplitude, and a Hybrid phase/angle scheme -- for QCNNs under depolarizing noise. We develop a fully differentiable PyTorch--Qiskit pipeline with a custom autograd bridge, batched parameter-shift gradients, and shot scheduling, and use it to train QCNNs on downsampled binary variants of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST at $4\times 4$ and $8\times 8$ resolutions.
  Our experiments reveal regime-dependent trade-offs. On aggressively downsampled $4\times 4$ inputs, Angle encoding attains higher accuracy and remains comparatively robust as noise increases, while the Hybrid encoder trails and exhibits non-monotonic trends. At $8\times 8$, the Hybrid scheme can overtake Angle under moderate noise, suggesting that mixed phase/angle encoders benefit from additional feature bandwidth. Amplitude-encoded QCNNs are sparsely represented in the downsampled grids but achieve strong performance in lightweight and full-resolution configurations, where training dynamics closely resemble classical convergence. Taken together, these results provide practical guidance for choosing QCNN encoders under joint constraints of resolution, noise strength, and simulation budget.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Scheduling for Single-downlink Satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD), leveraging low photon loss in free-space quantum communication, is widely regarded as one of the most promising directions to achieve global-scale QKD. With a constellation of satellites and a set of ground stations in a satellite-based QKD system, how to schedule satellites to achieve efficient QKD is an important problem. This problem has been studied in the dual-downlink architecture, where each satellite distributes pairs of entanglements to two ground stations simultaneously. However, it has not been studied in the single downlink architecture, where satellites create keys with each individual ground station, and then serve as trusted nodes to create keys between pairs of ground stations. While the single downlink architecture provides weaker security in that the satellites need to be trusted, it has many advantages, including the potential of achieving significantly higher key rates, and generating keys between pairs of ground stations that are far away from each other and cannot be served using the dual-downlink architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic approach for satellite scheduling that accounts for fairness among the ground station pairs, while taking advantage of the dynamic satellite channels to maximize the system performance. We evaluate this approach in a wide range of settings and demonstrate that it provides the best tradeoffs in terms of total and minimum key rates across the ground station pairs. Our evaluation also highlights the importance of considering seasonal effects and cloud coverage in evaluating satellite-based QKD systems. In addition, we show different tradeoffs in global and regional QKD systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a core task in quantum system identification. Real experimental conditions often deviate from nominal designs, introducing errors in both the measurement devices and the Hamiltonian governing the system's dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of quantum state tomography against such perturbations in both static and dynamic settings using linear regression estimation. We derive explicit bounds that quantify how bounded errors in the measurement devices and the Hamiltonian affect the mean squared error (MSE) upper bound in each scenario. Numerical simulations for qubit systems illustrate how these bounds scale with resources.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical molecular docking is fundamentally constrained by the combinatorial growth of ligand translational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering exhaustive pose enumeration infeasible on classical hardware. This work introduces a quantum-native formulation that encodes ligand occupancy on discretized three-dimensional grids and coherently generates the full ensemble of spatial configurations within a single quantum state. Multi-step translations and rotational transformations are controlled by ancillary qubits, enabling all symmetry-related configurations to be activated simultaneously. This framework provides a scalable foundation for quantum-accelerated virtual screening and is amenable to integration with quantum scoring approaches as quantum hardware continues to advance.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Error Mitigation with Neighbor-Informed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise in quantum hardware is the primary obstacle to realizing the transformative potential of quantum computing. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) offers a promising pathway to enhance computational accuracy on near-term devices, yet existing methods face a difficult trade-off between performance, resource overhead, and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce neighbor-informed learning (NIL), a versatile and scalable QEM framework that unifies and strengthens existing methods such as zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) and probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), while offering improved flexibility, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.
  NIL learns to predict the ideal output of a target quantum circuit from the noisy outputs of its structurally related ``neighbor'' circuits. A key innovation is our 2-design training method, which generates training data for our machine learning model. In contrast to conventional learning-based QEM protocols that create training circuits by replacing non-Clifford gates with uniformly random Clifford gates, our approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Furthermore, we prove that the required size of the training set scales only \emph{logarithmically} with the total number of neighbor circuits, enabling NIL to be applied to problems involving large-scale quantum circuits. Our work establishes a theoretically grounded and practically efficient framework for QEM, paving a viable path toward achieving quantum advantage on noisy hardware.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement underpins quantum technologies but its study is limited by the lack of universal measures, unified frameworks, and the intractability of convex-roof extensions. We establish an axiomatic framework and introduce the first \emph{true} $k$-entanglement measure, $E_w^{(k,n)}$, which satisfies all axioms, establishes $k$-entanglement as a multipartite quantum resource, avoids convex-roof constructions, and is efficiently computable. A universal algorithm evaluates arbitrary finite-dimensional states, with open-source software covering all partitions of four-qubit systems. Numerical tests certify $k$-entanglement within 200 seconds, consistent with necessary-and-sufficient criteria, tightening bounds and revealing new thresholds. This framework offers a scalable, practical tool for rigorous multipartite entanglement quantification.</description>

      <title>Operational Derivation of Born's Rule from Causal Consistency in Generalized Probabilistic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12636v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an operational derivation of Born's rule within finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), without assuming Hilbert-space structure. From a single causal requirement, namely causal consistency, together with sharp measurements, reversible symmetries, and no-signaling, we show that any admissible state-to-probability map must be affine under mixing; otherwise, its curvature enables superluminal signaling via steering. Using standard reconstruction results, affinity forces the probability assignment to coincide with the quadratic transition function of complex quantum theory. Our three-stage argument (operational assignment, causal-consistency constraints, and structural reconstruction) recovers complex quantum theory and identifies Born's rule as a causal fixed point among admissible probabilistic laws. We discuss limitations of the derivation and outline steering-based experiments that could bound deviations from affinity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames in Quantum Circuits: Perspective Dependent Entangling Cost and Coherence Entanglement Trade Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perspective-neutral formulation of quantum reference frames (QRFs) treats observers as quantum systems and describes physics relationally from within the composite system. While frame-change maps and frame-invariant resource sums are theoretically understood, their impact on circuit-based quantum information processing has largely remained unexplored. We formulate QRF transformations as circuit compilation rules and, for systems with finite Abelian symmetry described by the regular representation, derive a gate-level dictionary that maps local operations in one frame to their images in another. This yields a group-theoretic classification of gates where symmetry-commuting operators remain local, up to frame-dependent phases, while generic gates are promoted to controlled entangling operations in which the original frame acts as a control register. The resulting frame-dependence entangling-gate count defines a relational circuit complexity where the cost of a computation depends on the internal reference frame of the observer. We instantiate the framework in a three-qubit model and show that the QRF unitary acts as a lossless converter between a purity-based local coherence and concurrence, preserving their invariant sum and giving a concrete realization of the relativity of entanglement. We implement the corresponding circuits on an IBM Quantum superconducting platform, using full state tomography to reconstruct the redistribution of resources between internal frames. The hardware data reproduce the predicted conversion of local coherence into entanglement, and the observed deviations from exact conservation quantify the effect of realistic device noise on relational quantum protocols.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this letter is to compute the evolution of some expected values, such as the field operators $a^{\pm}$, quadratures and atomic inversion, under SUSY partner Hamiltonians associated to the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum optics. This kind of SUSY partners are characterized by having spectra which differ in a finite number of energy levels. We wish to elucidate if the partner connection has any influence on these expected values. In particular, we want also to know in which way the classical and revival times are affected by such SUSY partners.</description>

      <title>Mid-circuit logic executed in the qubit layer of a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical quantum computers need to continuously exchange data between classical and quantum subsystems during a computation. Mid-circuit measurements of a qubits state are transferred to the classical electronics layer, and their outcome can inform feedforward operations that close the loop back to the quantum layer. These operations are crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computers, but the quantum-classical loop must be completed before the qubits decohere, presenting a substantial engineering challenge for full-scale systems comprising millions of qubits. Here we perform the first mid-circuit measurements in a system of silicon spin qubits, and show that feedforward operations can be performed without needing to route information to the classical layer. This in-layer approach leverages a backaction-driven control technique that has previously been considered a source of error. We benchmark our in-layer strategy, together with the standard FPGA-enabled approach, and analyse the performance of both methods using gate set tomography. Our results provide the first step towards moving resource-intensive classical processing into the quantum layer, an advance that could solve key engineering challenges, and drastically reduce the power budget of future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Implicit Neural Representations for 3D Scene Reconstruction and Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have become a powerful paradigm for continuous signal modeling and 3D scene reconstruction, yet classical networks suffer from a well-known spectral bias that limits their ability to capture high-frequency details. Quantum Implicit Representation Networks (QIREN) mitigate this limitation by employing parameterized quantum circuits with inherent Fourier structures, enabling compact and expressive frequency modeling beyond classical MLPs. In this paper, we present Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for neural radiance field rendering. Q-NeRF integrates QIREN modules into the Nerfacto backbone, preserving its efficient sampling, pose refinement, and volumetric rendering strategies while replacing selected density and radiance prediction components with quantum-enhanced counterparts. We systematically evaluate three hybrid configurations on standard multi-view indoor datasets, comparing them to classical baselines using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Results show that hybrid quantum-classical models achieve competitive reconstruction quality under limited computational resources, with quantum modules particularly effective in representing fine-scale, view-dependent appearance. Although current implementations rely on quantum circuit simulators constrained to few-qubit regimes, the results highlight the potential of quantum encodings to alleviate spectral bias in implicit representations. Q-NeRF provides a foundational step toward scalable quantum-enabled 3D scene reconstruction and a baseline for future quantum neural rendering research.</description>

      <title>FiD-QAE: A Fidelity-Driven Quantum Autoencoder for Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in financial security, as fraudulent transactions are rare, highly imbalanced, and often resemble legitimate ones. A wide range of classical machine learning methods, as well as more recent quantum machine learning approaches, have been investigated to address this challenge, each providing valuable progress but also leaving open questions regarding scalability, robustness, and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns. In this work, we introduce the Fidelity-based Quantum Autoencoder (FiD-QAE), a quantum architecture that employs fidelity estimation as the decision criterion for anomaly detection. Transactions are encoded into quantum states, compressed through a variational quantum circuit, and evaluated using the SWAP test to distinguish legitimate from fraudulent transactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FiD-QAE, including statistical analyses, multiple performance metrics, and robustness tests under quantum noise models. The results show that FiD-QAE maintains consistent performance across different imbalance levels and preserves robustness in noisy conditions. Moreover, validation on IBM Quantum hardware backends confirms the feasibility of our approach on real devices, with outcomes consistent with simulation. These findings position quantum fidelity as a powerful criterion for anomaly detection and highlight FiD-QAE as a promising direction that complements existing classical and quantum approaches, offering robustness and generalizability for financial fraud detection in realistic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the topological structure of multipartite entanglement in symmetric Dicke states $|D_n^{(k)}\rangle$. By viewing qubits as topological loops, we establish a direct correspondence between the recursive measurement dynamics of Dicke states and the stability of $n$-Hopf links. We utilize the Schmidt rank to quantify bipartite entanglement resilience and introduce the $l_1$-norm of quantum coherence as a measure of link fluidity. We demonstrate that unlike fragile states such as $ \left| GHZ \right \rangle$ (analogous to Borromean rings), Dicke states exhibit a robust, self-similar topology where local measurements preserve the global linking structure through non-vanishing residual coherence.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical models represent a crucial step toward leveraging near-term quantum devices for sequential data processing. We present Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) as hybrid quantum language models, reporting the first empirical demonstration of generative language modeling trained and evaluated end-to-end on real quantum hardware. Our architecture combines hardware-optimized parametric quantum circuits with a lightweight classical projection layer, utilizing a multi-sample SPSA strategy to efficiently train quantum parameters despite hardware noise. To characterize the capabilities of these models, we introduce a synthetic dataset designed to isolate syntactic dependencies in a controlled, low-resource environment. Experiments on IBM Quantum processors reveal the critical trade-offs between circuit depth and trainability, demonstrating that while noise remains a significant factor, observable-based readout enables the successful learning of sequential patterns on NISQ devices. These results establish a rigorous engineering baseline for generative quantum natural language processing, validating the feasibility of training complex sequence models on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Cancellation of Optical Rotations in Fructose Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, one of the most representative phenomena in quantum mechanics, has been widely used for fundamental studies and modern quantum technologies. In this paper, we report the observation of nonlocal cancellation and addition of optical rotations with polarization-entangled photons in fructose solutions. The entanglement also enables probing optical activities at a distance by joint measurements on the entangled photons. The good agreement between the experimental results and theoretical predictions demonstrates the potential for extending these measurements to other chiral molecules, with a sensitivity that improves as the number of entangled photons increases.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Fourier Transform for Continuous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform for discrete variable (dvQFT) is an efficient algorithm for several applications. It is usually considered for the processing of quantum bits (qubits) and its efficient implementation is obtained with two elementary components: the Hadamard gate and the controlled--phase gate. In this paper, the quantum Fourier transform operating with continuous variables (cvQFT) is considered. Thus, the environment becomes the Hilbert space, where the natural definition of the cvQFT will be related to rotation operators, which in the $N$--mode are completely specified by unitary matrices of order $N$. Then the cvQFT is defined as the rotation operator whose rotation matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. For the implementation of rotation operators with primitive components (single--mode rotations and beam splitters), we follow the well known Murnaghan procedure, with appropriate modifications. Moreover, algorithms related to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are applied to reduce drastically the implementation complexity. The final part is concerned with the application of the cvQFT to general Gaussian states. In particular, we show that cvQFT has the simple effect of transforming the displacement vector by a one-dimensional DFT, the squeeze matrix by a two-dimensional DFT, and the rotation matrix by a Fourier-like similarity transform.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven quantum systems near the Zeno limit: steady states and long-time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study composite open quantum systems with a finite-dimensional state space ${\mathcal H}_A\otimes {\mathcal H}_B$ governed by a Lindblad equation $\rho'(t) = {\mathcal L}_\gamma \rho(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_\gamma\rho = -i[H,\rho] + \gamma {\mathcal D} \rho$, and ${\mathcal D}$ is a dissipator ${\mathcal D}_A\otimes I$ acting non-trivially only on part $A$ of the system, which can be thought of as the boundary, and $\gamma$ is a parameter. It is known that the dynamics simplifies for large $\gamma$: after a time of order $\gamma^{-1}$, $\rho(t)$ is well approximated for times small compared to $\gamma^2$ by $\pi_A\otimes R(t)$ where $\pi_A$ is a steady state of ${\mathcal D}_A$, and $R(t)$ is a solution of $\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}R(t) = {\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma}R(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma} R := -i[H_P,R] + \gamma^{-1} {\mathcal D}_P R$ with $H_P$ being a Hamiltonian on ${\mathcal H}_B$ and ${\mathcal D}_P$ being a Lindblad generator over ${\mathcal H}_B$. We prove this assuming only that ${\mathcal D}_A$ is ergodic and gapped. In order to better control the long time behavior, and study the steady states $\bar\rho_\gamma$, we introduce a third Lindblad generator ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ that does not involve $\gamma$, but still closely related to ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$. We show that if ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ is ergodic and gapped, then so is ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$ for all large $\gamma$, and if $\bar\rho_\gamma$ denotes the unique steady state for ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$, then $\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes \bar R$ where $\bar R$ is the unique steady state for ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$. We show that there is a convergent expansion $\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes\bar R +\gamma^{-1} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^{-k} \bar n_k$ where, defining $\bar n_{-1} := \pi_A\otimes\bar R$, ${\mathcal D} \bar n_k = -i[H,\bar n_{k-1}]$ for all $k\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Measures to characterise Approximate Mutually Unbiased Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutually Unbiased bases has various application in quantum information procession and coding theory. There can be maximum d + 1 MUBs in C^d and d/2 +1 MUBs in R^d. But , over R^d MUBs are known to be non existent when d is odd and for most of the other even d there are mostly 3 Real MUBs. In case of C^d the construction for complete set of MUBs are known for only Prime Power dimension. Thus in general large set of MUBs are not known, particularly for composite dimensions which are not of the form of prime powers. Because of this, there are many constructions of Approximate version of MUBs. In this paper we make an attempt to define certain measures to characterise the AMUBs. Our construction of measures derives its inspiration from the applications of MUBs, and based on them, we define certain quantifiable measures, which are can be computed and gives estimates of how close the Approximate MUBs are to the MUBs. We use geometric interpretation, projective design features of MUBs and applications like Optimal State determination and Entropic Uncertainty of MUBs. We show generic relationship between these measures and show that it can be evaluated for APMUBs without known the exact construction details, thereby showing that definition of APMUB is sufficient completely characterise it. We also evaluate these measure for an interesting class of AMUBs called Weak MUBs and certain AMUBs constructed using RBDs.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Geometry of Operational Contexts: A Riemannian-Style Framework for Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an intrinsic geometric framework on the space of operational contexts, specified by channels, stationary states, and self-preservation functionals. Each context C carries a pointer algebra, internal charges, and a self-consistent configuration minimizing a self-preservation functional. The Hessian of this functional yields an intrinsic metric on charge space, while non-commutative questioning loops dN -&gt; dPhi -&gt; d rho^circ define a notion of curvature. In suitable regimes, this N-Q-S geometry reduces to familiar Fisher-type information metrics and admits charts that resemble Riemannian or Lorentzian space-times. We outline how gauge symmetries and gravitational dynamics can be interpreted as holonomies and consistency conditions in this context geometry.</description>

      <title>Actual and weak actual values in Bohmian mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12951v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in Bohmian mechanics concerns whether observables other than position possess definite values. We introduce a condition of operational robustness as a criterion for when an observable can be attributed an actual value in a given Bohmian state. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition: under appropriate regularity conditions, an actual value can be consistently assigned if and only if the wave function satisfies a local eigencondition of the corresponding operator at the particle's configuration. For general states, we define a weak actual value as a derived theoretical construct to characterize the local average behavior of an observable along a trajectory. We prove that its ensemble average equals the standard quantum expectation value and derive its evolution equation. Furthermore, we establish that the weak actual value equals the real part of the quantum weak value when post-selecting on position. This work extends and formalizes earlier discussions on the definability of observables in Bohmian mechanics, develops a conceptual and mathematical framework for discussing the ontological status of observables, and establishes a theoretical correspondence with weak measurement experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence in Reflected and Refracted Beams: A Van Cittert-Zernike Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum optics have highlighted the critical role of spatial propagation in controlling the quantum coherence of light beams. However, the evolution of quantum coherence for light beams undergoing fundamental optical processes at dielectric interfaces remains unexplored. Furthermore, manipulating multiphoton correlations typically requires complex interactions that challenge few-photon level implementation. Here, we introduce a quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem for light beams, describing how their coherence-polarization properties are influenced by reflection and refraction, as well as how these properties evolve upon subsequent propagation. Our work demonstrates that the quantum statistics of photonic systems can be controllably modified through the inherent polarization coupling arising from reflection and refraction at an interface, without relying on conventional light-matter interactions. Our approach reveals regimes where thermal light can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics with fluctuations below the shot-noise level through post-selected measurements, and this statistical property can be tuned by the incident angle. Remarkably, this quantum statistical modification is governed by a scaling law linking beam collimation to far-field thermalization. Our work establishes a robust, decoherence-avoiding mechanism for quantum state control, advancing the fundamental understanding of coherence in quantum optics and opening new avenues for applications in quantum information and metrology.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Random Access Memory: A Data-Independent Unitary Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction for Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that achieves a single, data-independent unitary operator. Unlike routing-based approaches or circuit methods that yield data-dependent unitaries, our Universal QRAM encodes data in memory qubits that act as quantum control signals within a block-diagonal permutation structure. The key insight is that memory qubits serve as control signals, enabling coherent lookup when addresses are in superposition. For N addresses with K-bit data words, the construction requires $\log_2 N + K + NK$ qubits and decomposes into exactly $NK$ multi-controlled gates. We verify the construction for $N \in \{2, 4, 8, 16\}$ and $K \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, confirming that the resulting unitary is a pure permutation matrix with zero error across all data configurations. This approach simplifies QRAM implementation by separating fixed circuit structure from variable data encoding.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-time-enhanced feedback-based quantum algorithms for universal ground-state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing ground states of strongly correlated quantum systems is a central goal in quantum simulation and optimization. The feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON) provides an attractive alternative to variational methods with a fully quantum feedback rule, but it fails in the presence of spectral degeneracies, where the feedback signal collapses and the evolution cannot reach the ground state. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Perturbations of Hausdorff Dimension in Quantum Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Abbott et al. analyzed the relationship between a particle's trajectory and the resolution of position measurements performed by an observer at fixed time intervals. They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of strong Charge-Parity violation and Peccei-Quinn mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) admits a topological {\theta}-term that violates Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry, yet experimental indicate that {\theta} is nearly zero. To investigate this discrepancy in a controlled setting, we derive the Hamiltonian representation of the QCD Lagrangian and construct its (1+1)-dimensional Schwinger-model analogue. By encoding fermionic and gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using the Jordan-Wigner and quantum-link schemes, we obtain a compact Pauli Hamiltonian that retains the relevant topological vacuum structure. Ground states are prepared using a feedback-based quantum optimization protocol, enabling numerical evaluation of the vacuum energy E0({\theta}) on a few-qubit simulator. Our results show a displaced vacuum at nonzero {\theta}in agreement with strong-interaction expectations, and demonstrate that introducing a dynamical axion field drives the system toward {\theta}= 0, thereby realizing the Peccei-Quinn mechanism within a minimal quantum simulation. These results illustrate how quantum hardware can examine symmetry violation and its dynamical resolution in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The emergence of long-range entanglement and odd-even effect in periodic generalized cluster models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties in a generalized cluster model under periodic boundary condition. By evaluating the entanglement entropy and the quantum conditional mutual information entropy under three or four subsystem partitions, we identify clear signatures of long-range entanglement. Specifically, when both the system size $N$ and the interaction range $m$ are odd, the system exhibits nonzero four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropies. This non-vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy directly signals the presence of long-range entanglement. In contrast, all other combination of $N$ and $m$ yield vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy. Remarkably, in the case of $N, m \in \text{odd}$, these long-range entangled features persist even in the presence of a finite transverse field, demonstrating their robustness against quantum fluctuations. These results demonstrate how the interplay between system size and interaction range governs the emergence of long-range entanglement in one-dimensional spin systems.</description>

      <title>Neural quantum states for entanglement depth certification from randomized Pauli measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement depth quantifies how many qubits share genuine multipartite entanglement, but certification typically relies on tailored witnesses or full tomography, both of which scale poorly with system size. We recast entanglement-depth and non-$k$-separability certification as likelihood-based model selection among neural quantum states whose architecture enforces a chosen entanglement constraint. A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix. We validate the method on simulated six- and ten-qubit datasets targeting GHZ, Dicke, and Bell-pair states, and demonstrate robustness for mixed states under local noise. Finally, we discuss lightweight interpretability diagnostics derived from trained parameters that expose coarse entanglement patterns and qubit groupings directly from bitstring statistics.</description>

      <title>Genuine Tripartite Strong Coupling in a Superconducting-Spin Hybrid Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate genuine tripartite strong coupling in a solid-state hybrid quantum system comprising a superconducting transmon qubit, a fixed-frequency coplanar-waveguide resonator, and an ensemble of NV$^-$ centers in diamond. Frequency-domain spectroscopy reveals a characteristic three-mode avoided crossing, indicating that single excitations are coherently shared across all three subsystems. At higher probe powers, we observe nonlinear features including multiphoton transitions and signatures of transmon-${}^{14}\mathrm{N}$ nuclear-spin interactions, highlighting the accessibility of higher-excitation manifolds in this architecture. These results establish a new regime of hybrid cavity QED that integrates superconducting and spin degrees of freedom, providing a platform for exploring complex multicomponent dynamics and developing hybrid quantum interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Joint Quantum Computing, Neural Network and Embedding Theory Approach for the Derivation of the Universal Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach that exploits the intersection of quantum computing, machine learning and reduced density matrix functional theory to leverage the potential of quantum computing to improve simulations of interacting quantum particles. Our method focuses on obtaining the universal functional using a deep neural network trained with quantum algorithms. We also use fragment-bath systems defined by density matrix embedding theory to strengthen our approach by substantially expanding the space of Hamiltonians for which the obtained functional can be applied without the need for additional quantum resources. Given the fact that once obtained, the same universal functional can be reused for any system where the interactions within the embedded fragment are identical, our work demonstrates a way to potentially achieve a cumulative quantum advantage within quantum computing applications for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Intense-Laser Nondipole-Induced Symmetry Breaking in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy in solids gives insight into the inner workings of solids, such as reconstructing band structures or probing the topological phase of materials. High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly non-linear phenomena and simulations guide interpretation of experimental results. These simulations often rely on the electric dipole approximation, even though the driving fields enter regimes that challenge its accuracy. Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical dynamics and emergent universality in decoherent digital quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how noise influences nonequilibrium quantum critical dynamics is essential for both fundamental physics and the development of practical quantum technologies. While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Practical Homodyne Shadow Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow estimation provides an efficient framework for estimating observable expectation values using randomized measurements. While originally developed for discrete-variable systems, its recent extensions to continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems face practical limitations due to idealized assumptions of continuous phase modulation and infinite measurement resolution. In this work, we develop a practical shadow estimation protocol for CV systems using discretized homodyne detection with a finite number of phase settings and quadrature bins. We construct an unbiased estimator for the quantum state and establish both sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for informational completeness within a truncated Fock space up to $n_{\mathrm{max}}$ photons. We further provide a comprehensive variance analysis, showing that the shadow norm scales as $\mathcal{O}(n_{\mathrm{max}}^4)$, improving upon previous $\mathcal{O}(n_{\mathrm{max}}^{13/3})$ bounds. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical shadow estimation and experimental implementations, enabling robust and scalable quantum state characterization in realistic CV systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of a Bit-Sequence Reconciliation Protocol Based on Neural TPM Networks in Secure Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article discusses a key reconciliation protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems based on Tree Parity Machines (TPM). The idea of transforming key material into neural network weights is presented. Two experiments were conducted to study how the number of synchronization iterations and the amount of leaked information depend on the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the range of neural network weights. The results show a direct relationship between the average number of synchronization iterations and QBER, an increase in iterations when the weight range is expanded, and a reduction in leaked information as the weight range increases. Based on these results, conclusions are drawn regarding the applicability of the protocol and the prospects for further research on neural cryptographic methods in the context of key reconciliation.</description>

      <title>A Conjecture on Almost Flat SIC-POVMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well supported conjecture states that SIC-POVMs -- maximal sets of complex equiangular lines -- with anti-unitary symmetry give rise to an identity expressing some of its overlaps as squares of the (rescaled) components of a suitably chosen fiducial vector. In number theoretical terms the identity essentially expresses Stark units as sums of products of pairs of square roots of Stark units. We investigate whether the identity is enough to determine these Stark units. The answer is no, but the failure might be quite mild.</description>

      <title>High-purity frequency-degenerate photon pair generation via cascaded SFG/SPDC in thin film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-degenerate photon pairs generated using nonlinear photonic integrated devices are a crucial resource for scalable quantum information processing and metrology. However, their realization is hindered by unwanted parametric processes occurring within the same phase matching band, which degrade the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the purity of the associated quantum states. Here, we propose a dual-pump scheme to produce frequency-degenerate photon pairs, based on cascaded sum-frequency generation and spontaneous parametric down-conversion occurring within a single waveguide, while strongly suppressing parasitic photon pair generation from single-pump processes. This approach significantly simplifies the design compared to microresonator-based methods and enables both pumping and collection of photon pairs entirely in the telecom band. We experimentally validate the concept in a layer-poled thin film lithium niobate waveguide, achieving frequency-degenerate photon pair generation with a brightness of \SI{1.0(3)e5}{\hertz \per \nm \per \square \milli \watt } and a 40 dB suppression of unwanted single-pump processes.</description>

      <title>Distillation of continuous variable qudits from single photon sources: A cascaded approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creation of high fidelity photonic quantum states in the continuous variable regime is indispensable for the implementation of quantum technologies universally. However, this is a challenging task as it requires higher nonlinearity or larger Fock states. In this article, we surmount this necessity by using a linear optical setup with a cascaded arrangement of beam splitters that relies solely on single photon sources and single photon detectors to tailor desired single mode nonclassical states. To show the utility of this setup, we demonstrate the generation of displaced higher photon states with unit fidelity and the family of Schrodinger cat states above $98\%$ fidelity. In addition, we manifest the generation of GKP resource states, such as ON states and weak cubic phase states with $99\%$ fidelity. Creating such a variety of important states in this single setup is made feasible by stating the output in the form of displaced qudits. This figure of merit facilitates efficient identification and optimization of input parameters required to generate the target single mode quantum states. We also account for the experimental imperfections by incorporating detector inefficiencies and non-unit single photon sources. This cascaded setup will assist the experimentalists to explore the feasible creation of target states using currently available resources, such as single photon sources and single photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Slowing and Storing Microwaves in a Single Superconducting Fluxonium Artificial Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-level Lambda systems provide a versatile platform for quantum optical phenomena such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT), slow light, and quantum memory. Such Lambda systems have been realized in several quantum hardware platforms including atomic systems, superconducting artificial atoms, and meta-structures. Previous experiments involving superconducting artificial atoms incorporated coupling to additional degrees of freedom, such as resonators or other superconducting atoms. In this work, we performed an EIT experiment in microwave frequency range utilizing a single Fluxonium qubit within a microwave waveguide. The Lambda system is consisted of two plasmon transitions in combination with one metastable state originating from the fluxon transition. In this configuration, the controlling and probing transitions are strongly coupled to the transmission line, safeguarding the transition between 0 and 1 states, and ensuring the Fluxonium qubit is close to the sweet spot. Our observations include the manifestation of EIT, a slowdown of light with a delay time of 217 ns, and photon storage. These results highlight the potential as a phase shifter or quantum memory for quantum communication in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Dual-Qubit Hierarchical Fuzzy Neural Network for Image Classification: Enabling Relational Learning via Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical deep neural network models struggle to represent data uncertainty and capture dependencies between features simultaneously, especially under fuzzy or noisy conditions. Although a quantum-assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN) was proposed to learn fuzzy membership for each feature, it cannot model dependencies between features due to its single-qubit encoding. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed. Experiments under noisy conditions suggest that it is robust against noise and has the potential to be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy production is a fundamental concept in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, providing a direct measure of the irreversibility inherent in any physical process. In this work, we investigate in steady-state the enhancement of irreversibility employing coherent feedback loop. We evaluate the steady-state entropy production rate and quantum correlations by applying the quantum phase space formulation to calculate the entropy change. Our study reveals the essential contribution of coherent feedback in the thermal bath's input-noise operators, resulting in the system being driven far from thermal equilibrium. Our analysis shows that in the small-coupling limit, the entropy production rate is proportional to the quantum mutual information. We use for application the optomechanical system of Fabry-P\'erot cavity, and show that the picks of the entropy production corresponding of the heating/cooling of movable mirror are improved. Therefore, we conclude that irreversibility and quantum correlations are not independent and must be analyzed jointly. The results demonstrate the possibility of enhancement of entropy production and pave the way for promising quantum thermal applications through coherent feedback loop.</description>

Abstract: We unify Ramsey, twist-untwist, and random quantum sensors using operator algebra and account for the Fisher scaling of various sensor designs. We illustrate how the operator orbits associated with state preparation inform the scaling of the sensitivity with the number of subsystems. Using our unified model, we design a novel set of sensors in which a projected ensemble of quantum states exhibits beyond-shot-noise metrological performance. We also show favorable scaling of Fisher information with decoherence models and loss of particles.</description>

Abstract: We present a set of efficiently implementable logical multi-qubit gates in concatenated quantum error correction codes using parity qubits. In particular, we show how fault-tolerant high-weight rotation gates of arbitrary angle can be implemented on single physical qubits of a classical stabilizer code, or on localized regions of full quantum error correction codes. Similarly, we show how transversal CNOT gates can implement logical parity-controlled-NOT operations between arbitrarily many logical qubits. Both operation types can be implemented and in many cases parallelized without the use of lattice surgery or the need for complicated routing operations.</description>

      <title>Achievable Trade-Off in Network Nonlocality Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks are essential for advancing scalable quantum information processing. Quantum nonlocality sharing provides a crucial strategy for the resource-efficient recycling of quantum correlations, offering a promising pathway toward scaling quantum networks. Despite its potential, the limited availability of resources introduces a fundamental trade-off between the number of sharable network branches and the achievable sequential sharing rounds. The relationship between available entanglement and the sharing capacity remains largely unexplored, which constrains the efficient design and scalability of quantum networks. Here, we establish the entanglement threshold required to support unbounded sharing across an entire network by introducing a protocol based on probabilistic projective measurements. When resources fall below this threshold, we derive an achievable trade-off between the number of sharable branches and sharing rounds. To assess practical feasibility, we compare the detectability of our protocol with weak-measurement schemes and extend the sharing protocol to realistic noise models, providing a robust framework for nonlocality recycling in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Information on Quantum Heat Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is beginning to reveal the intriguing role that information can play in quantum thermal engines. Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines. While both a general theory of quantum feedback control as well as specific examples of quantum feedback-controlled engines have been presented, still lacking is a general framework for such machines. Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive the fundamental lower bound for the preparation fidelity of a maximally-entangled (Bell) state of two atoms involving Rydberg-state interactions. This bound represents the minimum achievable error $E \geq ( 1 + \pi/2 ) \Gamma/B$ due to spontaneous decay $\Gamma$ of the Rydberg states and their finite interaction strength $B$. Using quantum optimal control methods, we identify laser pulses for preparing a maximally-entangled state of a pair of atomic qubits with an error only $1\%$ above the derived fundamental bound.</description>

Abstract: Using the key properties of chaos, i.e. ergodicity and exponential instability, as a resource to control classical dynamics has a long and considerable history. However, in the context of controlling "chaotic" quantum unitary dynamics, the situation is far more tenuous. The classical concepts of exponential sensitivity to trajectory initial conditions and ergodicity do not directly translate into quantum unitary evolution. Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Riemannian gradient descent-based quantum algorithms for ground state preparation with guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Riemannian gradient flows for preparing ground states of a desired Hamiltonian on a quantum device. We show that the number of steps of the corresponding Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm that prepares a ground state to a given precision depends on the structure of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we develop an upper bound for the number of RGD steps that depends on the spectral gap of the Hamiltonian, the overlap between ground and initial state, and the target precision. In numerical experiments we study examples where we observe for a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that the RGD steps needed to prepare a ground state scales linearly with the number of spins. For all-to-all couplings a quadratic scaling is obtained. To achieve efficient implementations while keeping convergence guarantees, we develop RGD approximations by randomly projecting the Riemannian gradient into polynomial-sized subspaces. We find that the speed of convergence of the randomly projected RGD critically depends on the size of the subspace the gradient is projected into. Finally, we develop efficient quantum device implementations based on Trotterization and a quantum stochastic drift-inspired protocol. We implement the resulting quantum algorithms on IBM's quantum devices and provide data for small-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Decoding 3D color codes with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical large-scale quantum computation requires both efficient error correction and robust implementation of logical operations. Three-dimensional (3D) color codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their transversal non-Clifford gates, but efficient decoding remains challenging. In this work, we extend previous decoders for two-dimensional color codes [1], which are based on the restriction of the decoding problem to a subset of the qubit lattice, to three dimensions. Including boundaries of 3D color codes, we demonstrate that the 3D restriction decoder achieves optimal scaling of the logical error rate and a threshold value of 1.55(6)% for code-capacity bit- and phase-flip noise, which is almost a factor of two higher than previously reported for this family of codes [2, 3]. We furthermore present qCodePlot3D, a Python package for visualizing 2D and 3D color codes, error configurations, and decoding paths, which supports the development and analysis of such decoders. These advancements contribute to making 3D color codes a more practical option for exploring fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Wigner function negativity in a classical model of quantum light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of negative values in the Wigner quasiprobability distribution is deemed one of the hallmarks of nonclassical phenomena in quantum systems. Here we demonstrate a classical model of squeezed light that, when combined with post-selection on amplitude threshold-crossing detection events, is capable of reproducing observed behavior of single-photon added coherent states. In particular, a classical model of balanced homodyne detection and standard tomographic techniques are used to infer the density matrix in the Fock basis. The resulting Wigner functions exhibit negatively for photon-added vacuum and weak coherent states.</description>

      <title>Arrival Time -- Classical Parameter or Quantum Operator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of how to interpret and compute arrival-time distributions in quantum mechanics remains unsettled, reflecting the longstanding tension between treating time as a quantum observable or as a classical parameter. Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Quantum Mpemba Effect on Markovian Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), which occurs when an out-of-equilibrium system reaches equilibrium faster than another that is closer to equilibrium, has attracted significant attention from the scientific community as an intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon. It generalizes its classical counterpart by extending the concept beyond temperature equilibration. This paper approaches the QME in Markovian open quantum systems from different perspectives. First, we propose a physical mechanism based on decoherence-free subspaces. Second, we show that an exponential enhancement of the decay rate toward equilibrium, scaling with system size, can be obtained, leading to an extreme version of the phenomenon in Markovian open quantum systems. Third, we study the strong Mpemba effect through the unravelings of Davies maps, revealing subtleties in the choice of figures of merit used to identify the QME. Finally, we propose a microscopic model to gain deeper insight into bath dynamics in this context.</description>

      <title>Multi-Photon Lasing Phenomena in Quantum Dot-Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon lasing has been realized in systems with strong nonlinear interactions between emitters and cavity modes, where single-photon processes are suppressed. Coherence between the internal states of a quantum emitter, or among multiple emitters, plays a key role. Such continuous nonclassical sources of light can find applications in quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication.
  This thesis explores the multi-photon lasing phenomena in various quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) setups. Exciton-phonon interactions are inevitable in such systems and are incorporated using the polaron-transformed master equation. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix rate equation. Using quantum laser theory, we derived the Scully-Lamb laser rate equations and evaluated the single- and multi-photon excess emission rates defined as the difference between emission and absorption rates into the cavity mode without mean-field approximations. We investigated cooperative two-photon lasing, correlated emission lasing, hyperradiant lasing, non-degenerate two-mode two-photon lasing, and continuous variable entanglement in open quantum systems with single or multiple semiconductor quantum dots (two-level, three-level, and four-level) driven coherently/incoherently and coupled to single/ bimodal cavities.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Formulation of Dequantized Algorithms for Ground State Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying quantum advantage for practical problems, particularly the ground state energy estimation (GSEE) problem, is one of the central challenges in quantum computing theory. For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin Maximum Principle for Rydberg-blockaded state-to-state transfers: A semi-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-optimal state-to-state control for two- and multi-qubit operations motivated by neutral-atom quantum processors within the Rydberg blockade regime. Block-diagonalization of the Hamiltonian simplifies the dynamics and enables the application of a semi-analytic approach to the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to derive optimal laser controls. We provide a general formalism for $N$ qubits. For $N=2$ qubits, we classify normal and abnormal extremals, showcasing examples where abnormal solutions are either absent or suboptimal. For normal extremals, we establish a correspondence between the laser detuning from atomic transitions and the motion of a classical particle in a quartic potential, yielding a reduced, semi-analytic formulation of the control problem. Combining PMP-based insights with numerical optimization, our approach bridges analytic and computational methods for high-fidelity, time-optimal control.</description>

      <title>Three-qubit entangling gates with simultaneous exchange controls in spin qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise exchange couplings have long been the standard mechanism for entangling spin qubits in semiconductor systems. However, implementing quantum circuits based on pairwise exchange gates often requires a lengthy sequence of elementary gate operations. In this work, we present an alternative approach: multi-qubit entangling gate operations that simultaneously drive the exchange couplings between multiple pairs of spin qubits. We explore three spin qubit systems in linear or triangular configurations. We derive analytical expressions for these multi-exchange entangling operations and demonstrate how to use the resulting three-qubit gates to construct quantum circuits capable of generating standard entangled states such as GHZ and W states, and the Toffoli gate, by optimizing control parameters. Our results show that this multi-qubit strategy significantly reduces the number of required operations, offering a pathway to more efficient, shallower, and more coherent circuits for spin-qubit processors.</description>

      <title>Optimised Fermion-Qubit Encodings for Quantum Simulation with Reduced Transpiled Circuit Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of fermionic Hamiltonians with gate-based quantum computers requires the selection of an encoding from fermionic operators to quantum gates, the most widely used being the Jordan-Wigner transform. Many alternative encodings exist, with quantum circuits and simulation results being sensitive to choice of encoding, device connectivity and Hamiltonian characteristics. Non-stochastic optimisation of the ternary tree class of encodings to date has targeted either the device or Hamiltonian. We develop a deterministic method which optimises ternary tree encodings without changing the underlying tree structure. This enables reduction in Pauli-weight without ancillae or additional swap-gate overhead. We demonstrate this method for a variety of encodings, including those which are derived from the qubit connectivity graph of a quantum computer. Across a suite of standard encoding methods applied to water in STO-3G basis, including Jordan-Wigner, our method reduces qDRIFT circuit depths on average by $27.7\%$ and $26.0\%$ for untranspiled and transpiled circuits respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel tomography and estimation by local test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the estimation of an unknown quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$ with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. We establish a connection between the query complexities in two models: (i) access to $\mathcal{E}$, and (ii) access to a random dilation of $\mathcal{E}$. Specifically, we show that for parallel (possibly coherent) testers, access to dilations does not help. This is proved by constructing a local tester that uses $n$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ yet faithfully simulates the tester with $n$ queries to a random dilation. As application, we show that:
  - $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$.
  Moreover, when $rd_2=d_1$, we show that the Heisenberg scaling $O(1/\varepsilon)$ can be achieved, even if $\mathcal{E}$ is not a unitary channel:
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{2.5}/\varepsilon,d_1^2/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$, and $O(d_1^2/\varepsilon)$ queries suffice for the case of Choi state trace norm error $\varepsilon$.
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{1.5}/\varepsilon,d_1/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for tomography of the mixed state $\mathcal{E}(|0\rangle\langle 0|)$ to within trace norm error $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrability of Hamiltonians with Time-Dependent Interaction Strengths and the Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction strengths. As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Certified-Everlasting Quantum NIZK Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13628v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) for NP satisfying: 1) statistical soundness, 2) computational zero-knowledge and 3) certified-everlasting zero-knowledge (CE-ZK). The CE-ZK property allows a verifier of a quantum proof to revoke the proof in a way that can be checked (certified) by the prover. Conditioned on successful certification, the verifier's state can be efficiently simulated with only the statement, in a statistically indistinguishable way. Our contributions regarding these certified-everlasting NIZKs (CE-NIZKs) are as follows:
  - We identify a barrier to obtaining CE-NIZKs in the CRS model via generalizations of known interactive proofs that satisfy CE-ZK.
  - We circumvent this by constructing CE-NIZK from black-box use of NIZK for NP satisfying certain properties, along with OWFs. As a result, we obtain CE-NIZKs for NP in the CRS model, based on polynomial hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption.
  - In addition, we observe that the aforementioned barrier does not apply to the shared EPR model. Consequently, we present a CE-NIZK for NP in this model based on any statistical binding hidden-bits generator, which can be based on LWE. The only quantum computation in this protocol involves single-qubit measurements of the shared EPR pairs.</description>

      <title>Quadratic and cubic scrambling in the estimation of two successive phase-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparameter quantum estimation becomes challenging when the parameters are incompatible, i.e., when their respective symmetric logarithmic derivatives do not commute, or when the model is sloppy, meaning that the quantum probe depends only on combinations of parameters leading to a degenerate or ill-conditioned Fisher information matrix. In this work, we explore the use of scrambling operations between parameter encoding to overcome sloppiness. We consider a bosonic model with two phase-shift parameters and analyze the performance of second- and third-order nonlinear scrambling using two classes of probe states: squeezed vacuum states and coherent states. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear scrambling mitigates sloppiness, increases compatibility, and improves overall estimation precision. We find third-order nonlinearity to be more effective than second-order under both fixed-probe and fixed-energy constraints. Furthermore, by comparing joint estimation to a stepwise estimation strategy, we show that a threshold for nonlinear coupling exists. For coherent probes, joint estimation outperforms the stepwise strategy if the nonlinearity is sufficiently large, while for squeezed probes, this advantage is observed specifically with third-order nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Matter-Mediated Entanglement in Classical Gravity: Suppression by Binding Potentials and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aziz and Howl [Nature 646 (2025)] argue that two spatially separated masses can become entangled even when gravity is treated as a classical field, by invoking higher-order "virtual-matter" processes in a QFT description of matter, which is non-LOCC (local operations and classical communication). We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a quantum tunneling/evanescent matter channel, which is already captured within ordinary quantum mechanics. More importantly, the microscopic constituents of realistic macroscopic objects are bound and localized by strong potentials, introducing a large internal energy scale that suppresses coherent propagation between distant bodies. Including such binding/localization generically yields an exponential suppression, rendering the matter-mediated contribution negligible at the macroscopic separations relevant to gravitational-entanglement proposals. Consequently, the entanglement identified by AH diagnoses the presence of a coherent matter-exchange channel rather than the classical or quantum nature of gravity, and it does not undermine LOCC-based witness arguments in realistic bound-matter platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum oracles give an advantage for identifying classical counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles.</description>

      <title>Comparing concepts of quantum and classical neural network models for image classification task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08875v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum architectures are still under development, when available, they will only be able to process quantum data when machine learning algorithms can only process numerical data. Therefore, in the issues of classification or regression, it is necessary to simulate and study quantum systems that will transfer the numerical input data to a quantum form and enable quantum computers to use the available methods of machine learning. This material includes the results of experiments on training and performance of a hybrid quantum-classical neural network developed for the problem of classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set. The comparative results of two models: classical and quantum neural networks of a similar number of training parameters, indicate that the quantum network, although its simulation is time-consuming, overcomes the classical network (it has better convergence and achieves higher training and testing accuracy).</description>

      <title>Coherently synchronized oscillations in many-body localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find an unexpected phenomenon of coherently synchronized oscillations in a mirror-symmetric many-body localized system. A synchronization transition of the spin oscillations is found by changing the spin-spin interactions. To understand this phenomenon, an effective Ising model based on local integrals of motion is proposed. We find that the synchronization transition can be understood as a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic Ising transition. Based on the Ising model, we theoretically estimate the synchronized frequencies and the synchronization transition points, which agree well with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and glassy properties in 2D Anderson localization: eigenstates and wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the universal nature of fluctuations in disordered quantum systems remains poorly understood. Here, we present extensive numerical evidence that fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) Anderson localization belongs to the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation for fermionic Hamiltonians without a linear part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-contained treatment of the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation for homogeneous fermionic Hamiltonians is presented. The aim is to provide a quick reference that may also serve as supplementary material for a graduate-level course, and that can be understood with quantum mechanics knowledge up to the level of the second quantization's rules. The objective of the transformation is to cast a quadratic Hamiltonian into a diagonal form that resembles the Hamiltonian of a system of non-interacting particles. To obtain this, the first step consists in putting its coefficient matrix into its canonical form; the transformation can always be performed on fermionic Hamiltonians, only some care must be taken when this form is singular. Having explained how to cast a general matrix into its standard form, a complete description of the transformation is provided; a novel procedure is proposed here for the singular matrix case.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Input-Output Theory of Floquet Cavity Magnonics and Magnon Energy Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $\epsilon = (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion dark matter with magnetic resonance force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) search for axion dark matter around 1 GHz. The experiment leverages the axion's derivative coupling to electrons, which induces an effective A.C. magnetic field on a sample of electron spins polarized by a D.C. magnetic field and a micromagnet. A second pump field at a nearby frequency enhances the signal, with the detuning matched to the resonant frequency of a magnet-loaded mechanical oscillator. The resulting spin-dependent force is detected with hih sensitivity via optical interferometry. Accounting for the relevant noise sources, we show that current technology can be used to put constraints competitive with those from laboratory experiments with just a minute of integration time. Furthermore, varying the pump field frequency and D.C. magnetic field allows one to scan the axion mass. Finally, we explore this setup's capability to put constraints on other dark matter - Standard Model couplings.</description>

Abstract: We report a spin-(1/2, 5/2) three-leg ladder realized in a radical-Mn polymer, exhibiting an antiferromagnetic transition and magnetization curves accurately described by classical mean-field theory. Although the underlying spin model intrinsically supports strong quantum fluctuations, as confirmed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the real system shows an anomalously complete suppression of quantum behavior. These findings provide a key experimental benchmark for the quantum-classical crossover and suggest that lattice topology can play a crucial role in tuning the balance between quantum and classical physics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: Cavity ring-down (CRD) spectroscopy represents a direct absorption technique of sample absorption measurement. Instead of measuring the amount of the absorbed light, this technique determines the rate at which light intensity decays inside an optical cavity. When using a pulsed or continuous-wave light source, CRD spectroscopy offers considerably higher sensitivity as compared with conventional spectroscopy of absorption, making even very weak absorptions easy to detect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the sympathetic cooling and Coulomb crystallization of xenon highly charged ions (HCIs) with laser-cooled Ca$^+$ ions. The HCIs are produced in a compact electron beam ion trap, then charge selected, decelerated, and finally injected into a cryogenic linear Paul trap. There, they are captured into $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Coulomb crystals, and co-crystallized within them, causing dark voids in their fluorescence images. Fine control over the number of trapped ions and HCIs allows us to realize mixed-species crystals with arbitrary ordering patterns. By investigating Xe$^{q+}$--Ca$^+$ strings, we confirm the HCI charge states, measure their lifetime and characterize the mixed-species motional modes. Our system effectively combines the established quantum control toolbox for Ca$^+$ with the rich set of atomic properties of Xe highly charged ions, providing a resourceful platform for optical frequency metrology, searches for signatures of new physics, and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Interaction-assisted topological pumping in few- and many-atom Rydberg arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology can imbue lattice systems with special properties, notably the presence of robust eigenstates living at their boundary. Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Entropic Skin Spatial Entanglement from the QCD Confinement Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations into High-Energy QCD have identified entanglement entropy as a crucial observable, linking parton distributions to the structure of the quantum vacuum. While momentum-space entanglement has been extensively studied in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), the spatial realization of this entanglement in confined systems remains an open question. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the confining boundary of the MIT Bag Model acts as an ``Entropic Skin,'' generating maximal Spin-Position entanglement. We calculate the local reduced density matrix for the confined quark and show that the linear boundary condition, $i \gamma^\mu n_\mu \psi = \psi$, acts as an entangling gate. The surface entropy density reaches a geometric invariant of $\approx 0.918$ bits ($92\%$ of the qubit limit), independent of the bag radius. We discuss the implications of this result for Chiral Symmetry breaking and propose that this boundary entropy is the precursor to the pion cloud in effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Complete Topological Quantization of Higher Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument.
  In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems.
  An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Plane--Convex Microcavity for Room-Temperature Polaritons with Geometric \(g\)-Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a plane--convex open microcavity that supports room-temperature polariton spectroscopy and offers a simple geometric handle on the coupling rate. The effective length ($L_{\mathrm{eff}}$) is absolutely calibrated from the free-spectral range, and piezo tuning is performed at near-normal incidence ($k_{\parallel}!\approx!0$) to avoid angle-induced degradation. Using spin-coated PEA$2$PbI$4$ quasi-2D perovskites, we observe clear anti-crossings in reflection, with vacuum Rabi splittings up to $71~\mathrm{meV}$ (reflection) and $87~\mathrm{meV}$ (PL) near $L{\mathrm{eff}}!\approx!3~\mu\mathrm{m}$. A linewidth-corrected analysis converts the apparent splitting into the coherent exciton--photon coupling rate $g$, revealing a robust geometric scaling $g \propto L{\mathrm{eff}}^{-1/2}$ across multiple longitudinal orders and spatial sites, consistent with the filled-mode thin-film limit where the transverse area cancels in the mode volume. The platform establishes a compact, broadly compatible testbed for room-temperature polaritons and provides a practical design rule: shortening $L_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is a reliable geometric lever to strengthen collective coupling in plane--convex microcavities.</description>

      <title>Extended dissipaton theory for higher-order bath couplings and application to non-Condon spectroscopy with anharmonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an extended dissipaton theory that generalizes the environmental couplings beyond the conventional linear and quadratic forms, enabling the treatment of arbitrary order of bath couplings. Applying this theoretical framework to the condensed-phase non-Condon spectroscopy, we demonstrate the interplay of anharmonicity, non-Condon and solvent effects on optical spectra. Precise simulations are carried out with high efficiency on linear absorption spectra involving the above mentioned correlated effects. We exhibit how an anharmonic potential modulates the vibronic feature, offering insights into the role of nonlinear environmental couplings in spectroscopic signatures and exemplifying the success of the extended dissipaton formalism as an exact and efficient method for higher-order bath couplings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlation and Synchronisation-Enhanced Energy Transfer in Driven-Dissipative Light-Harvesting Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in the presence of strong vibrational dissipation remains under active investigation. We revisit this process in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using the exciton-vibrational dimer model. By comparing the quantum dynamics with classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix populations and vibrational-mode observables, we show how both environment-assisted transfer and coherent-light pumping can sustain significant energy flow despite strong electronic dephasing. Our open quantum systems (OQS) computational treatment highlights the quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom that underpin synchronisation-enhanced transfer efficiency in the driven-dissipative regime, suggesting potential avenues for future investigation of solar energy-transfer mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Probing the Crossover between Dynamical Phases with Local Correlations in a Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental detection of non-equilibrium quantum criticality remains a challenge, as traditional signatures like dynamical quantum phase transitions rely on hard-to-measure global properties. Here, we demonstrate that local connected correlation functions provide a superior, practical means to directly probe the dynamics of magnetic order in a quenched Rydberg atom array. Using a Magnus expansion formalism, we derive analytic expressions for these correlations that capture a smooth crossover from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic dominance. Our analytic results, which reveal the critical parameter relationship $U_{c}(\delta)$, are validated against exact numerical simulations and exhibit robustness to finite-size effects. By shifting the focus from global singularities to local correlations, our protocol establishes a direct and feasible path to observe the rich critical dynamics in scalable quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tuneable Variability in Germanium Hole Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in planar germanium heterostructures are frontrunners for scalable semiconductor quantum computing. However, their current performance is mostly limited by large dot-to-dot variability that leads to uncontrolled qubit energies and random tilts in the spin quantization axis. Here, we propose a systematic and local method to engineer the spin qubit response by imprinting a controlled anisotropy in the quantum dot confinement, enabling on-demand electric g-tensor control. In particular, we find that both the quantum-dot size and asymmetry allow electrical tuning of the g-tensor and significantly suppress magnitude and angular variability of the spin response for selected magnetic field directions. We confirm this behavior by analyzing single-disorder realizations and statistical ensembles in state-of-the-art strained and unstrained germanium channels, showing that the latter provides an optimal path for $g$-tensor engineering. Our results provide practical design principles for on-demand control of the spin response and mitigating variability, paving the way towards large-scale germanium-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Proximity effects and a topological invariant in a Chern insulator connected to leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed robustly quantized Hall conductance in quantum Hall systems and Chern insulators (CI) have so far been understood in terms of the topology of isolated systems, which are not coupled to leads. It is assumed that the leads act as inert reservoirs that simply supply/absorb electrons to/from the sample. Within a model of a CI coupled to leads with a cylindrical geometry, we show that this is not true. In the proximity of the CI, the edge current leaks into the leads, with the Hall conductance quantized only if this novel proximity effect is taken into account. For a special choice of leads, we identify the conductance with a topological invariant of the system, in terms of the winding number of the phase of the reflection coefficients of the scattering states.</description>

      <title>Basis Adaptive Algorithm for Quantum Many-Body Systems on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new basis adaptive algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical platforms is introduced to efficiently find the ground-state (gs) properties of quantum many-body systems. The method addresses limitations of many algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) etc by using shallow Trotterized circuits for short real-time evolution on a quantum processor. The sampled basis is then symmetry-filtered by using various symmetries of the Hamiltonian which is then classically diagonalized in the reduced Hilbert space. We benchmark this approach on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain up to 24 qubits using the IBM Heron processor. The algorithm achieves sub-percent accuracy in ground-state energies across various anisotropy regimes. Crucially, it outperforms the Sampling Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method, demonstrating a substantially lower energy error for comparable reduced-space dimensions. This work validates symmetry-filtered, real-time sampling as a robust and efficient path for studying correlated quantum systems on current near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Single-step Quantum Simulation of Two Nucleons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a scalable approach to solving the nuclear shell model, a highly complex and exponentially scaled many-body problem. This work presents a numerical simulation of the subspace search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) combined with an adaptive derivative-assembles pseudo-trotter (ADAPT) ansatz to obtain the low-lying states of any nuclear system in a single optimization run. As an example, we apply this method in this work to a trivial identical nucleon system, two nucleons in the $0p_{3/2}$ orbital, mapped to 4 qubits depicting m-scheme single-particle states including a surface delta effective interaction using the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The ADAPT-SSVQE algorithm, by utilizing a symmetry-preserving double-excitation ADAPT operator pool, uniquely optimizes a weighted energy sum, forcing the simultaneous convergence of two lowest states within the total angular momentum $M_J=0$ subspace. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by benchmarking against the exact diagonalization, confirming its potential for probing nuclear structure and pairing phenomena on current and near-future quantum devices without requiring multi-step procedure for excited states.</description>

      <title>Unraveling real-time chemical shifts in the ultrafast regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) relies upon a direct mapping between the photoelectron binding energies and the local chemical environment, which is well-characterized by an electrostatic partial charges model for systems in equilibrium. However, the extension of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems has been hampered by the lack of x-ray sources capable of accessing multiple atomic sites with high spectral and temporal resolution, as well as the lack of simple theoretical procedures to interpret the observed signals. In this work we employ multi-site XPS with a narrowband femtosecond x-ray probe to unravel different ultrafast dissociation processes of a polyatomic molecule, fluoromethane (CH$_{3}$F). We show that XPS can follow the cleavage of both the C-F and C-H bonds in real time, despite these channels lying close in binding energy. Additionally, we apply the partial charges model to describe these dynamics, and verify this extension with both advanced ab-initio calculations and experimental data. These results enable the application of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems of higher complexity, by correlating real-time information from multiple atomic sites and interpreting the measurements through a viable theoretical modelling.</description>

      <title>Tales of Hoffman: from a distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hoffman proved that a graph $G$ with adjacency eigenvalues $\lambda_1\geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n$ and chromatic number $\chi(G)$ satisfies $\chi(G)\geq 1+\kappa,$ where $\kappa$ is the smallest integer such that $$\lambda_1+\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}\lambda_{n+1-i}\leq 0.$$ We extend this eigenvalue bound to the distance-$k$ setting, and also show a strengthening of it by proving that it also lower bounds the corresponding quantum distance coloring graph parameter. The new bound depends on a degree-$k$ polynomial which can be chosen freely, so one needs to make a good choice of the polynomial to obtain as strong a bound as possible. We thus propose linear programming methods to optimize it. We also investigate the implications of the new bound for the quantum distance chromatic number, showing that it is sharp for some classes of graphs. Finally, we extend the Hoffman bound to the distance setting of the vector chromatic number. Our results extend and unify several previous bounds in the literature.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Typicality as the Dynamical Bridge to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis: A Derivation from Entropy, Geometry, and Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet its physical foundations and minimal underlying assumptions remain actively debated. In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Giant Negative Magnetoresistance in Tellurene Driven by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\boldsymbol{\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})\cdot\sigma$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $\Delta R_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\cal E},{\bf B})/R_0=-\beta_{g}(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})^2$, with $\beta_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Electronic Structure Theory: From Diatomic Lambda-Doubling to Macroscopic Einstein-de Haas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\Lambda$-doubling of diatomic molecules is a subtle microscopic phenomenon that has long attracted the attention of experimental groups, insofar as rotation of molecular $\textit{nuclei}$ induces small energetic changes in the (degenerate) $\textit{electronic}$ state. A direct description of such a phenomenon clearly requires going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $\Lambda$-doubling energy splitting (or $\Lambda$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $\Lambda-$doubling). The data presented in this manuscript offers another small glimpse into the rich physics that one can learn from investigating phase space potential energy surfaces $E_{PS}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{P})$ as a function of both nuclear position and momentum, all at a computational cost comparable to standard Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Gibbs state postulate from dynamical stability -- Redundancy of the zeroth law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbs states play a central role in quantum statistical mechanics as the standard description of thermal equilibrium. Traditionally, their use is justified either by a heuristic, a posteriori reasoning, or by derivations based on notions of typicality or passivity. In this work, we show that Gibbs states are completely characterized by assuming dynamical stability of the system itself and of the system in weak contact with an arbitrary environment. This builds on and strengthens a result by Frigerio, Gorini, and Verri (1986), who derived Gibbs states from dynamical stability using an additional assumption that they referred to as the "zeroth law of thermodynamics", as it concerns a nested dynamical stability of a triple of systems. We prove that this zeroth law is redundant and that an environment consisting solely of harmonic oscillators is sufficient to single out Gibbs states as the only dynamically stable states.</description>

Abstract: Schr\"odinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transformations and show that: for model (i), 3D Schr\"odinger symmetry emerges, and the solution is the (anti-) de Sitter Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and for model (ii), $(2+n)$D Schr\"odinger symmetry appears, and the solution is a generalized Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime and its ``interior", a Kantowski-Sachs type closed universe. In the matter decoupling limit, both cases lead to 2D Schr\"odinger symmetry in different lapse functions and mini-superspace coordinates, which implies the covariance of Schr\"odinger symmetry. Finally, we propose a physical interpretation of the symmetry under Hamiltonian constraints $H$ and explain it with examples: Symmetry generators commuting with $H$ map a solution to another one, while those non-commuting with $H$ generate a new theory with the Schr\"odinger symmetry and the transformed configuration is a solution to the new theory. These support the robustness of the emergence of Schr\"odinger symmetry and open new possibilities for exploring quantum dynamics of matter and gravity based on the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Advantage in Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular simulations are widely regarded as leading candidates to demonstrate quantum advantage--defined as the point at which quantum methods surpass classical approaches in either accuracy or scale. Yet the qubit counts and error rates required to realize such an advantage remain uncertain; resource estimates for ground-state electronic structure span orders of magnitude, and no quantum-native method has been validated at a commercially relevant scale. Here we address this uncertainty by executing the iterative qubit coupled-cluster (iQCC) algorithm, designed for fault-tolerant quantum hardware, at unprecedented scale using a quantum solver on classical processors, enabling simulations of transition organo-metallic complexes requiring hundreds of logical qubits and millions of entangling gates. Using this approach, we compute the lowest triplet excited state (T$_1$) energies of Ir(III) and Pt(II) phosphorescent organometallic compounds and show that iQCC achieves the lowest mean absolute error (0.05 eV) and highest R$^2$ (0.94) relative to experiment, outperforming leading classical methods. We find these systems remain classically tractable up to $\sim$200 logical qubits, establishing the threshold at which quantum advantage in computational chemistry may emerge and clarifying resource requirements for future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product State Simulation of Reacting Shear Flows</title>

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent reactive flows has been the subject of significant research interest for several decades. Accurate prediction of the effects of turbulence on the rate of reactant conversion, and the subsequent influence of chemistry on hydrodynamics remain a challenge in combustion modeling. The key issue in DNS is to account for the wide range of temporal and spatial physical scales that are caused by complex interactions of turbulence and chemistry. In this work, a new computational methodology is developed that is shown to provide a viable alternative to DNS. The framework is the matrix product state (MPS), a form of tensor network (TN) as used in computational many body physics. The MPS is a well-established ansatz for efficiently representing many types of quantum states in condensed matter systems, allowing for an exponential compression of the required memory compared to exact diagonalization methods. Due to the success of MPS in quantum physics, the ansatz has been adapted to problems outside its historical domain, notably computational fluid dynamics. Here, the MPS is used for computational simulation of a shear flow under non-reacting and nonpremixed chemically reacting conditions. Reductions of 30% in memory are demonstrated for all transport variables, accompanied by excellent agreements with DNS. The anastaz accurately captures all pertinent flow physics such as reduced mixing due to exothermicity &amp; compressibility, and the formation of eddy shocklets at high Mach numbers. A priori analysis of DNS data at higher Reynolds numbers shows compressions as large as 99.99% for some of the transport variables. This level of compression is encouraging and promotes the use of MPS for simulations of complex turbulent combustion systems.</description>

      <title>A SAT Encoding for Optimal Clifford Circuit Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Executing quantum algorithms on a quantum computer requires compilation to representations that conform to all restrictions imposed by the device. Due to devices' limited coherence times and gate fidelities, the compilation process has to be optimized as much as possible. To this end, an algorithm's description first has to be synthesized using the device's gate library. In this paper, we consider the optimal synthesis of Clifford circuits -- an important subclass of quantum circuits, with various applications. Such techniques are essential to establish lower bounds for (heuristic) synthesis methods and gauging their performance. Due to the huge search space, existing optimal techniques are practically limited to small qubit counts (around six qubits for typical instances). In this work, we propose an optimal synthesis method for Clifford circuits based on encoding the task as a satisfiability (SAT) problem and solving it using a SAT solver in conjunction with a binary search scheme. Experiments on random instances with up to 6 qubits demonstrate that state-of-the-art heuristics on average produce more than twice the number of gates necessary.</description>

      <title>Quantum measurements and equilibration: the emergence of objective outcomes via entropy maximisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement postulate of quantum theory stands in conflict with the laws of thermodynamics and has evoked debate regarding what actually constitutes a measurement. With the help of modern quantum statistical mechanics, we take the first step in formalising the hypothesis that quantum measurements are driven by the natural tendency of closed systems to maximize entropy, a notion that we call the Measurement-Equilibration Hypothesis. In this paradigm, we investigate how classical measurement outcomes can emerge within a purely unitary framework, and find that: (i) the interactions used in standard measurement models fail to spontaneously encode information classically and (ii) while ideal projective measurements are impossible, one can (for a given form of Hamiltonian) approximate them exponentially well as more physical systems are collected together into an ``observer'' system. We thus lay the groundwork for self-contained models of quantum measurement, proposing improvements to our simple scheme.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of a tunable capacitively shunted flux qubit</title>

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a method to solve optimization problems that leverages quantum tunneling in a coupled qubit system. We present a detailed study of the coherence of a tunable capacitively-shunted flux qubit, designed for coherent quantum annealing applications. We find that for high qubit frequencies, thermal noise in the bias line makes a significant contribution to the relaxation, arising from the design choice to experimentally explore both fast annealing and high-frequency control. The measured dephasing rate is primarily due to intrinsic low-frequency flux noise in the two qubit loops, with additional contribution from the low-frequency noise of control electronics used for fast annealing. Our results characterize decoherence in a realistic setup for quantum annealing and are relevant for ongoing efforts toward building superconducting quantum annealers with increased coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a coupled nonlinear cavity-magnon system, consisting of two cavities, a second-order nonlinear element, and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere that supports Kerr magnons, to realize the sought-after highly tunable nonreciprocity. We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scalar Field Theory Based on the Extended Least Action Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it is shown that the non-relativistic quantum formulations can be derived from a least observability principle [36]. In this paper, we apply the principle to massive scalar fields, and derive the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave functional for the scalar fields. The principle extends the least action principle in classical field theory by factoring in two assumptions. First, the Planck constant defines the minimal amount of action a field needs to exhibit in order to be observable. Second, there are constant random field fluctuations. A novel method is introduced to define the information metrics to measure additional observable information due to the field fluctuations, \added{which is then converted to the additional action through the first assumption.} Applying the variation principle to minimize the total actions allows us to elegantly derive the transition probability of field fluctuations, the uncertainty relation, and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave functional. Furthermore, by defining the information metrics for field fluctuations using general definitions of relative entropy, we obtain a generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the wave functional that depends on the order of relative entropy. Our results demonstrate that the extended least action principle can be applied to derive both non-relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum scalar field theory. We expect it can be further used to obtain quantum theory for non-scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for linear and non-linear fractional reaction-diffusion equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional fractional reaction-diffusion equations have numerous applications in the fields of biology, chemistry, and physics, and exhibit a range of rich phenomena. While classical algorithms have an exponential complexity in the spatial dimension, a quantum computer can produce a quantum state that encodes the solution with only polynomial complexity, provided that suitable input access is available. In this work, we investigate efficient quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear fractional reaction-diffusion equations with periodic boundary conditions. For linear equations, we analyze and compare the complexity of various methods, including the second-order Trotter formula, time-marching method, and truncated Dyson series method. We also present a novel algorithm that combines the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation technique with the interaction picture formalism, resulting in optimal scaling in the spatial dimension. For nonlinear equations, we employ the Carleman linearization method and propose a block-encoding version that is appropriate for the dense matrices that arise from the spatial discretization of fractional reaction-diffusion equations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a family of identities that express general linear non-unitary evolution operators as a linear combination of unitary evolution operators, each solving a Hamiltonian simulation problem. This formulation can exponentially enhance the accuracy of the recently introduced linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method [An, Liu, and Lin, Physical Review Letters, 2023]. For the first time, this approach enables quantum algorithms to solve linear differential equations with both optimal state preparation cost and near-optimal scaling in matrix queries on all parameters.</description>

Abstract: The existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid (i.e., diabolically degenerated exceptional) singularities of simple bosonic systems composed of up to five modes with damping and/or amplification are analyzed. Their dynamics governed by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is followed using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Their dynamical matrices generally exhibit specific structures that allow for an effective reduction of their dimension by half. This facilitates analytical treatment and enables efficient spectral analysis based on characteristic second-order diabolical degeneracies. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points, observed directly in the dynamics of field operators, having up to third-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed. Surprisingly, exceptional degeneracies of only second and third orders are revealed, even though the systems with up to five modes are considered. Exceptional and diabolical genuine points and their degeneracies observed in the dynamics of second-order field-operator moments are also analyzed. Each analyzed bosonic system exhibits its own unique and complex dynamical behavior.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in simple bosonic systems - comprising up to six modes with damping and/or amplification - under two complementary scenarios to those described in Quantum 9, 1932 (2025): (i) nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics confined to a subspace of the full Liouville space, and (ii) systems featuring unidirectional coupling.} The system dynamics described by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is governed by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points with up to sixth-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed, though relevant only for short-time dynamics. This raises the question of whether higher-order inherited singularities exist in bosonic systems under general conditions. Nevertheless, for short times, unidirectional coupling of various types enables the concatenation of simple bosonic systems with second- and third-order exceptional degeneracies such that arbitrarily high exceptional degeneracies are reached. Methods for numerical identifying the quantum exceptional and hybrid points together with their degeneracies are addressed. Following Quantum 9, 1932 (2025) rich dynamics of second-order field-operator moments is analyzed from the point of view of the presence of exceptional and diabolical points and their degeneracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rainbow Codes: Achieving Linear Rate, Growing Distance and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates with Generalised Colour Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce rainbow codes, a novel class of quantum error correcting codes generalising colour codes and pin codes. Rainbow codes can be defined on any $D$-dimensional simplicial complex that admits a valid $(D + 1)$-colouring of its $0$-simplices. We study in detail the case where these simplicial complexes are derived from chain complexes obtained via the hypergraph product and, by reinterpreting these codes as collections of colour codes joined at domain walls, show that we can obtain code families with growing distance and number of encoded qubits as well as logical non-Clifford gates implemented by transversal application of $T$ and $T^\dag$. By combining these techniques with the quasi-hyperbolic colour codes of Zhu et al. (arXiv:2310.16982) we obtain a family of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates and parameters $[\![n, \Theta(n), \Theta(log(n))]\!]$. This is the first example of a family of LDPC codes with linear rate, growing distance and transversal non-Clifford gates, which are necessary conditions for the magic-state distillation parameter $\gamma =\textrm{log}_d (n/k)$ to be made arbitrarily small. In contrast to several other constructions that satisfy these requirements, our codes are natively defined on qubits, are LDPC, and have non-Clifford gates implementable by single-qubit (rather than entangling) physical operations, but are not asymptotically good.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Kernel Descent Optimizer for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum algorithms have garnered significant attention as a candidate approach for near-term quantum advantage using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this article we introduce kernel descent, a novel algorithm for minimizing the functions underlying variational quantum algorithms. We compare kernel descent to existing methods and carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we showcase scenarios in which kernel descent outperforms gradient descent and quantum analytic descent. The algorithm follows the well-established scheme of iteratively computing classical local approximations to the objective function and subsequently executing several classical optimization steps with respect to the former. Kernel descent sets itself apart with its employment of reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques in the construction of the local approximations, which leads to the observed advantages.</description>

      <title>Why quantum state verification cannot be both efficient and secure: a categorical approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advantage of quantum protocols lies in the inherent properties of the shared quantum states. These states are sometimes provided by sources that are not trusted, and therefore need to be verified. Finding secure and efficient quantum state verification protocols remains a big challenge, and recent works illustrate trade-offs between efficiency and security for different groups of states in restricted settings. However, whether a universal trade-off exists for all quantum states and all verification strategies remains unknown. In this work, we instantiate the categorical composable cryptography framework to show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. Our findings show that the prevailing cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient and secure.</description>

      <title>Unified error bounds for perturbations of non-Markovian open quantum systems in Gaussian environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present perturbative error bounds for the non-Markovian dynamics of observables in open quantum systems interacting with Gaussian environments, governed by a general Liouville dynamics. This extends the work of [Mascherpa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 100401, 2017], which demonstrated qualitatively tighter bounds over the standard Gr\"onwall-type inequality for unitary system-bath evolution. Our results apply to systems with both bosonic and fermionic environments. Our approach utilizes a superoperator formalism, which avoids the need for formal coherent state path integral calculations, or the dilation of Lindblad dynamics into an equivalent unitary framework with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This enables a unified treatment of a wide range of open quantum systems. These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for various recently developed pseudomode methods in simulating open quantum system dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) advancements over the past few years have had an unprecedented and revolutionary impact across everyday application areas. Its significance also extends to technical challenges within science and engineering, including the nascent field of quantum computing (QC). The counterintuitive nature and high-dimensional mathematics of QC make it a prime candidate for AI's data-driven learning capabilities, and in fact, many of QC's biggest scaling challenges may ultimately rest on developments in AI. However, bringing leading techniques from AI to QC requires drawing on disparate expertise from arguably two of the most advanced and esoteric areas of computer science. Here we aim to encourage this cross-pollination by reviewing how state-of-the-art AI techniques are already advancing challenges across the hardware and software stack needed to develop useful QC - from device design to applications. We then close by examining its future opportunities and obstacles in this space.</description>

      <title>On the physics of nested Markov models: a generalized probabilistic theory perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining potential probability distributions with a given causal graph is vital for causality studies. To bypass the difficulty in characterizing latent variables in a Bayesian network, the nested Markov model provides an elegant algebraic approach by listing exactly all the equality constraints on the observed variables. However, this algebraically motivated causal model comprises distributions outside Bayesian networks, and its physical interpretation remains vague. In this work, we inspect the nested Markov model through the lens of generalized probabilistic theory, an axiomatic framework to describe general physical theories. We prove that all the equality constraints defining the nested Markov model are valid theory-independently. At the same time, not every distribution within the nested Markov model is implementable, not even via exotic physical theories associated with generalized probability theories (GPTs). To interpret the origin of such a gap, we study three causal models standing between the nested Markov model and the set of all distributions admitting some GPT realization. Each of the successive three models gives a strictly tighter characterization of the physically implementable distribution set; that is, each successive model manifests new types of GPT-inviolable constraints. We further demonstrate each gap through a specially chosen illustrative causal structure. We anticipate our results will enlighten further explorations on the unification of algebraic and physical perspectives of causality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating transition rates in open quantum systems is hampered by computing-resource demands that grow rapidly with system size. We present a quantum-simulation framework that enables efficient estimation by recasting the transition rate, given as the time derivative of an equilibrium correlation function, into a set of independently measurable contributions. Each contribution term is evaluated as the expectation value of a parameter-tuned quantum process, thereby circumventing explicit Lindbladian numerics. We validate our method on a spin-1/2 decoherence model using an IBM quantum processor. Further, we apply the method to the Caldeira-Leggett model of quantum Brownian motion as a realistic and practically relevant setting and reaffirm the theoretical soundness and practical implementability. These results provide evidence that quantum simulation can deliver substantial computational advantages in studying open-system kinetics for quantum chemistry on an intermediate-scale quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: We present a general method for the implementation of quantum algorithms that optimizes both gate count and circuit depth. Our approach introduces connectivity-adapted CNOT-based building blocks called Parity Twine chains. It outperforms all known state-of-the art methods for implementing prominent quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform or the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm across a wide range of quantum hardware, including linear, square-grid, hexagonal, ladder and all-to-all connected devices. We show that even moderate increments in connectivity can yield significant efficiency improvements and reach the proven optimum for specific cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate a practical performance advantage of this approach for a wide range of compilation problems and quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers require microwave control lines running from room temperature to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Adding more lines without preliminary thermal modeling to make predictions risks overwhelming the cooling power at each thermal stage. In this paper, we investigate the thermal load of SC-086/50-SCN-CN semi-rigid coaxial cable, which is commonly used for the control and readout lines of a superconducting quantum computer, as we increase the number of lines to a quantum processor. We investigate the makeup of the coaxial cables, verify the materials and dimensions, and experimentally measure the total thermal conductivity of a single cable as a function of the temperature from cryogenic to room temperature values. We also measure the cryogenic DC electrical resistance of the inner conductor as a function of temperature, allowing for the calculation of active thermal loads due to Ohmic heating. Fitting this data produces a numerical thermal conductivity function used to calculate the static heat loads due to thermal transfer within the wires resulting from a temperature gradient. The resistivity data is used to calculate active heat loads, and we use these fits in a cryogenic model of a superconducting quantum processor in a typical Bluefors XLD1000-SL dilution refrigerator, investigating how the thermal load increases with processor sizes ranging from 100 to 225 qubits. We conclude that the theoretical upper limit of the described architecture is approximately 200 qubits. However, including an engineering margin in the cooling power and the available space for microwave readout circuitry at the mixing chamber, the practical limit is approximately 140 qubits.</description>

      <title>Space-Efficient Quantum Error Reduction without log Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an algorithm that outputs the correct answer with bounded error, say $1/3$, it is sometimes desirable to reduce this error to some arbitrarily small $\varepsilon$ -- e.g., if one wants to call the algorithm many times as a subroutine. The usual method, for both quantum and randomized algorithms, is majority voting, which incurs a multiplicative overhead of $O(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ from calling the algorithm this many times.
  Transducers are a recently introduced model of quantum computation, and it is possible to reduce the ``error'' of a transducer arbitrarily with only constant overhead, using a construction analogous to majority voting called purification. Even error-free transducers map to bounded-error quantum algorithms, so this does not let you reduce algorithmic error for free, but it does allow bounded-error quantum algorithms to be composed without incurring log factors.
  In this paper, we present a new highly simplified purifier, that can be understood as a weighted walk on a line similar to a random walk interpretation of majority voting. Our purifier has much smaller space and time complexity than the previous one. Indeed, it only uses one additional counter, and only performs two increment and two decrement operations on each iteration. It also has quadratically better dependence on the soundness-completeness gap of the algorithm being purified. We prove that our purifier has optimal query complexity, even down to the constant, which matters when one composes quantum algorithms to super-constant depth.
  Purifiers can be seen as a way of turning a ``Monte Carlo'' quantum algorithm into a ``Las Vegas'' quantum algorithm -- a process for which there is no classical analogue. Our simplified construction sheds light on this strange quantum phenomenon, and could have implications for the complexity of composed quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel family of entanglement measures for time-separated subsystems. Our definitions are applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. To illustrate their utility, we derive upper and lower bounds on time-separated correlation functions, akin to the bound on spatially separated correlators in terms of the mutual information. In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and execute them on the IBM quantum device ibm_sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy.</description>

      <title>Composably Secure Delegated Quantum Computation with Weak Coherent Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A client can delegate a quantum computation to a powerful remote server while ensuring the privacy and the integrity of its computation via Secure Delegated Quantum Computation (SDQC). Thanks to recent results making them noise-robust and resource-efficient, proofs-of-concept implementations of generic SDQC protocols have already been demonstrated. Yet, the requirements for implementing them are still too stringent to go beyond this step while maintaining high security expectations. To further reduce their physical resource cost, we show how to realise SDQC using weak coherent pulses (WCPs) instead of single photons. More precisely, we construct a protocol which guarantees that, among a sufficiently large batch of transmitted WCPs, at least one contained only a single photon. This holds even if the adversary controls the transmittance of the photonic link connecting the client and the server. Our protocol's security is proven in the composable Abstract Cryptography (AC) framework. This batch can then be fed to known quantum privacy amplification techniques to prepare a single secure qubit in the X-Y plane, which can be used in any composable SDQC protocol which relies on the secure preparation of single qubits. Furthermore, the guarantee on the batch of states can also be used for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) where the privacy amplification step is classical. In doing so, we address a weakness in the standard security proof of the decoy state method. While our protocol can be instantiated with any number of different intensities for the WCPs, using only two intensities already shows improved scaling at low transmittance, thus opening the possibility of increasing the distance between the client and the server.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of Big Data changed how we approach information systems engineering. Nowadays, when we can use remote sensing techniques for Big Data acquisition, the issues such data introduce are as important as ever. One of those concerns is the processing of the data. Classical methods often fail to address that problem or are incapable of processing the data in a reasonable time. With that in mind information system engineers are required to investigate different approaches to the data processing. The recent advancements in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices implementation allow us to investigate their application to real-life computational problem. This field of study is called quantum (information) systems engineering and usually focuses on technical problems with the contemporary devices. However, hardware challenges are not the only ones that hinder our quantum computation capabilities. Software limitations are the other, less explored side of this medal. Using multispectral image segmentation as a task example, we investigated how difficult it is to run a hybrid quantum-classical model on a real, publicly available quantum device. To quantify how and explain why the performance of our model changed when ran on a real device, we propose new explainability metrics. These metrics introduce new meaning to the explainable quantum machine learning; the explanation of the performance issue comes from the quantum device behavior. We also analyzed the expected money costs of running similar experiment on contemporary quantum devices using standard market prices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the impact of time-dependent gate voltages on entanglement generation in two capacitively coupled charge qubits, with single-electron injection triggered on demand. The gate voltage modulates the tunnel coupling between the qubits and electronic reservoirs, initiating charge transport into the system. The formation of entangled states arises from the competition between inter-qubit Coulomb interactions and electron hopping processes. Particular attention is paid to the temporal structure of the gate pulse, which plays a pivotal role in shaping the entanglement dynamics. By exploring a variety of pulse profiles, we uncover regimes of enhanced entanglement and identify optimal driving conditions. Additionally, we investigate how environmental dephasing deteriorates entanglement formation. Within the framework of the density matrix formalism, we calculate fidelity, linear entropy, and negativity to identify robust operational windows. These results provide insights into controlling quantum correlations in mesoscopic systems and underscore the importance of error mitigation strategies in realizing high-performance electronic quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to quantizing Markov chains. The approach is based on the Markov chain coupling method, which is frequently used to prove fast mixing. Given a particular coupling, e.g., a grand coupling, we construct a completely positive and trace preserving map. This quantum map has a unique fixed point, which corresponds to the quantum sample (qsample) of the classical Markov chain's stationary distribution. We show that the convergence time of the quantum map is directly related to the coupling time of the Markov chain coupling.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution array detectors are widely used in single-particle tracking, but their performance is limited by excess noise from background light and dark current. As pixel resolution increases, the diminished signal per pixel exacerbates susceptibility to noise, degrading tracking accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we use spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) as a noise-robust approach for estimating the motion characteristics of an optical point-like source. We show that SPADE efficiently concentrate the information into a few key spatial modes, drastically reducing the number of detectors while maintaining high estimation precision. Furthermore, we enhance the robustness of the estimation against excess noise by elaborately designing the modes to be decomposed. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a SPADE with two specific modes outperforms direct imaging in estimating the micro-oscillation frequency of an optical point source in the presence of excess noise.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of bimodule quantum Markov semigroups within the framework of quantum Fourier analysis. We introduce the concepts of bimodule detailed balance conditions and bimodule KMS symmetry, which not only generalize the classical notions of detailed balance but also expose interesting structures of quantum channels. We demonstrate that the evolution of densities governed by the bimodule quantum Markov semigroup with bimodule detailed balance is the gradient flow for the relative entropy with respect to the hidden density. Consequently, we obtain a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and a Talagrand inequality with respect to a hidden density from higher dimensional structure. Furthermore, we establish a Poincar\'{e} inequality for irreducible inclusions and relative ergodic bimodule quantum semigroups.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of many-body dynamics with noise-robust Trotter decomposition based on symmetric structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, which digitalizes quantum time evolution, provides a promising framework for simulating quantum dynamics on quantum hardware and exploring quantum advantage over classical computation. However, conventional Trotter circuits require a large number of non-local gates, lowering their faithfulness to the ideal dynamics when implemented on current noisy quantum hardware. While most previous studies have focused on circuit optimization, we instead propose a new Trotter decomposition that is intrinsically circuit-efficient for simulating quantum dynamics on near-term devices. Our method substantially reduces both the residual error by Trotter decomposition and the number of CNOT operations compared to conventional Trotter decompositions by exploiting the symmetry of the target model to construct an effective Hamiltonian with fewer two-qubit gates. We demonstrate the noise robustness of the proposed approach through numerical simulations of a nine-site Heisenberg model under realistic noise, and further validate its experimental practicality on the IBM superconducting device, achieving a state fidelity exceeding $0.98$ when combined with quantum error mitigation in the three-site case. The proposed circuit design is also compatible with existing circuit optimization techniques. Our results establish a practical route toward noise-resilient quantum simulation in many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the van der Waals interaction with rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic procedure to engineer the van der Waals force between levitated nanoparticles in high vacuum by setting them into a fast rotation. By tuning the rotation frequency close to a polaritonic resonance, we can significantly enhance the van der Waals attraction. In addition, for frequencies slightly beyond resonance, rotation can change the nature of the interaction from attraction to repulsion. Rotational Doppler shifts effectively modify the frequency-dependent polarizability of the nanoparticles, thereby reshaping their mutual interaction. As a concrete and realistic example, we consider spinning barium strontium titanate nanoparticles at state-of-the-art rotation frequencies and demonstrate a modification of the force within the sensitivity of current experimental techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate experimentally measurable signatures of quantum correlations in a coupled molecular dimer that strongly interacts with its vibrational environment. We investigate intensity and mode-resolved photon coincidences for different relative orientations of such dimers, and observe spatio-temporal correlations for various configurations. We find that projective measurements can produce cooperative signatures even when emitters are arranged orthogonal to each other. To model effects of vibrational environments that are present in realistic experimental situations, we use the polaron framework. Further, we also account for the effects of finite instrument response, varying temperature, and presence of static disorder. We analyse the effect of disorder in both dimer orientation and measurement direction and find that photon coincidences remain well-resolvable using state-of-the-art detectors. This work enhances our understanding of cooperative emission from two coupled emitters and offers direction for future experiments on probing their coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parametric excitations in a harmonically trapped binary Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate parametric excitation and pattern formation in a harmonically trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We assume the condensate to be in the miscible phase, but near the miscible-immiscible phase transition, where total density and spin density excitations are decoupled. By periodically modulating the atomic scattering lengths, Faraday patterns can be generated in both density and spin channels. In an elongated condensate, the pattern in the spin channel corresponds to a one-dimensional standing wave with the two components exhibiting an out-of-phase density oscillation, where the modulation frequency and the oscillation period are related to the velocity of the spin sound. After the spin pattern is fully developed, the system quickly enters a nonlinear destabilization regime. For a pancake-shaped condensate, a two-dimensional Faraday pattern is generated with an interesting l-fold rotational symmetry. The number of nodes along the radial and angular directions increases with larger modulation frequencies. We also compare the growth rates of spin Faraday patterns generated with different modulation protocols, which are accessible to current experiments.</description>

      <title>Reduced Density Matrices and Phase-Space Distributions in Thermofield Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is a powerful framework to account for thermal effects in a wavefunction setting, and has been extensively used in physics and quantum optics. TFD relies on a duplicated state space and creates a correlated two-mode thermal state via a Bogoliubov transformation acting on the vacuum state. However, a very useful variant of TFD uses the vacuum state as initial condition and transfers the Bogoliubov transformation into the propagator. This variant, referred to here as the inverse Bogoliubov transformation (iBT) variant, has recently been applied to vibronic coupling problems and coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians in a chemistry context, where the method is combined with efficient tensor network methods for high-dimensional quantum propagation. In the iBT/TFD representation, the mode expectation values are clearly defined and easy to calculate, but the thermalized reduced particle distributions such as the reduced 1-particle densities or Wigner distributions are highly non-trivial due to the Bogoliubov back-transformation of the original thermal TFD wavefunction. Here we derive formal expressions for the reduced 1-particle density matrix (1-RDM) that uses the correlations between the real and tilde modes encoded in the associated reduced 2-particle density matrix (2-RDM). We apply this formalism to define the 1-RDM and the Wigner distributions in the special case of a thermal harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we discuss several approximate schemes that can be extended to higher-dimensional distributions. These methods are demonstrated for the thermal reduced 1-particle density of an anharmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Configuration-dependent precision in magnetometry and thermometry using multi-qubit quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of quantum sensors composed of four qubits arranged in different geometries for magnetometry and thermometry. The qubits interact via the transverse-field Ising model with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, maintained in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath under an external magnetic field. Using quantum Fisher information (QFI), we evaluate the metrological precision of these sensors. For ferromagnetic couplings, weakly connected graphs (e.g., the chain graph, P_4) perform optimally in estimating weak magnetic fields, whereas highly connected graphs (e.g., the complete graph, K_4) excel at strong fields. Conversely, K_4 achieves the highest sensitivity for temperature estimation in the weak-field regime. In the antiferromagnetic case, we uncover a fundamental trade-off dictated by spectral degeneracy: configurations with non-degenerate energy spectra - such as the pan-like graph (three qubits in a triangle with the fourth attached) - exhibit strong magnetic field sensitivity due to their pronounced response to perturbations. In contrast, symmetric structures like the square graph, featuring degenerate energy levels (particularly ground-state degeneracy), are better suited for precise thermometry. Notably, our four-qubit sensors achieve peak precision in the low-temperature, weak-field regime. Finally, we introduce a spectral sensitivity measure that quantifies energy spectrum deformations under small perturbations, providing a simple heuristic indicator of metrological sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: We study precision charging in bosonic quantum batteries under a finite-energy constraint, using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of delivered excitations as an operational metric directly tied to the energy measured at a load. At the state level, we derive a classical bound whose violation is equivalent to antibunching and certifies non-classicality, and a Gaussian bound whose violation certifies non-Gaussianity under fixed temperature and energy-input constraints. We identify experimentally accessible non-Gaussian families that surpass this Gaussian bound at finite temperature, thereby establishing non-Gaussianity as a resource for enhanced charging precision. Finally, we introduce a linear photodetection model which, under standard linear-response assumptions, propagates these bounds to the photocurrent level and enables both witnesses to be evaluated solely from electrical statistics. Together, these results provide a realistic route to demonstrating an operational quantum advantage-defined as surpassing classical and Gaussian precision bounds-in a thermodynamically motivated energy-conversion task, with plausible near-term applications to the precision charging of fragile nanoscopic loads.</description>

Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their two-dimensional counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least four neighboring degrees of freedom. Here, we show that similar bipartite entanglement properties can be realized on a square lattice with anisotropic interactions in four different quadrants. The interaction to generate such entanglement is much simpler than the previous constructions by coupling orthogonal arrays of highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with different scalings of entanglement entropy at the critical point and in the lowly entangled phase, and faster decay of the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase. The tensor network representation of the new ground state consists of tensors with lower rank, while preserving a global geometry similar to that of the original networks.</description>

      <title>Security analysis of orthogonal state attack on a high-speed quantum key distribution system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-speed quantum key distribution (QKD) systems have achieved repetition frequencies above gigahertz through advanced technologies and devices, laying an important foundation for the deployment of high-key-rate QKD system. Although these advanced systems may introduce potential loopholes, an eavesdropper Eve is challenging to exploit them by performing the intercept-resend attacks due to the limited time window under high repetition frequency. However, here, we propose a security analysis model of orthogonal state attacks that do not require intercept-resend operation on the key rate of a QKD system. Under this framework, we propose a muted attack and experimentally verify the feasibility of the attack using a 1 GHz single-photon avalanche detector (SPAD). By sending hundreds of photons each time, Eve can mute Bob's SPADs to control the overall detection response of the QKD receiver, allowing her to learn nearly all the keys. Furthermore, we use this security model to simulate the overestimated key rates of the QKD system under orthogonal state attacks, including both the muted attack and the dead-time attack. This work theoretically and experimentally shows a timely case of the security vulnerability in the high-speed QKD system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ans\"atze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.</description>

      <title>Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. Achieving a device-independent verification of indefinite causal order would imply that nature allows for correlations that do not respect causality, independent of any experimental assumptions or underlying theoretical description of the experiment. To this end, a recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8328 \pm 0.0045$, which is 18 standard deviations above the Definite Causal Order Bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</description>

      <title>Edge of Many-Body Quantum Chaos in Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a machine learning paradigm that harnesses dynamical systems as computational resources. In its quantum extension -- quantum reservoir computing (QRC) -- these principles are applied to quantum systems, whose rich dynamics broadens the landscape of information processing. In classical RC, optimal performance is typically achieved at the ``edge of chaos," the boundary between order and chaos. Here, we identify its quantum many-body counterpart using the QRC implemented on the celebrated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our analysis reveals substantial performance enhancements near two distinct characteristic ``edges": a temporal boundary defined by the Thouless time, beyond which system dynamics is described by random matrix theory, and a parametric boundary governing the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes. These findings establish the ``edge of many-body quantum chaos" as a design guideline for QRC.</description>

      <title>Mitigating quantum operation infidelity through engineering the distribution of photon losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiport interferometers can be constructed from two-port components in various configurations. We investigate how these configurations influence the performance of quantum operations through asymmetries in optical losses. Using numerical simulations, we analyze the effect of photon-loss distributions on the fidelity of operations involving measurements. For both full- and partial-measurement protocols, we compare rectangular (symmetric-loss) and triangular (asymmetric-loss) architectures. Our results show that asymmetric loss configurations can reduce operation infidelity in several cases, revealing a quantifiable trade-off between fidelity and success probability, with implications for the design of high-fidelity photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Time Entangled Quantum Blockchain with Phase Encoding for Classical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain protocol.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quantum sensing networks via genetic algorithms and deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of graph topologies for quantum sensing networks designed to estimate weak magnetic fields. The sensors are modeled as spin systems governed by a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian in thermal equilibrium at low temperatures. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we evolve network topologies to maximize a perturbative spectral sensitivity measure, which serves as the fitness function for the GA. For the best-performing graphs, we compute the corresponding quantum Fisher information (QFI) to assess the ultimate bounds on estimation precision. To enable efficient scaling, we use the GA-generated data to train a deep neural network, allowing extrapolation to larger graph sizes where direct computation becomes prohibitive. Our results show that while both the fitness function and QFI initially increase with system size, the QFI exhibits a clear non-monotonic behavior - saturating and eventually declining beyond a critical graph size. This reflects the loss of superlinear scaling of the QFI, as the narrowing of the energy gap signals a crossover to classical scaling of the QFI with system size. The effect is reminiscent of the microeconomic law of diminishing returns: beyond an optimal graph size, further increases yield reduced sensing performance. This saturation and decline in precision are particularly pronounced under Kac scaling, where both the QFI and spin squeezing plateau or degrade with increasing system size. We also attribute observed even-odd oscillations in the spectral sensitivity measure and QFI to quantum interference effects in spin phase space, as confirmed by our phase-space analysis. These findings highlight the critical role of optimizing interaction topology - rather than simply increasing network size - and demonstrate the potential of hybrid evolutionary and learning-based approaches for designing high-performance quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Unitary Gate Synthesis via Polynomial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies, particularly in the design and implementation of fast and accurate gates for quantum computing. Here, we present a method to synthesize gates using the Magnus expansion. In particular, we formulate a polynomial optimization problem that allows us to find the global solution without resorting to approximations of the exponential. The global method we use provides a certificate of globality and lets us do single-shot optimization, which implies it is generally faster than local methods. By optimizing over Hermitian matrices generating the unitaries, instead of the unitaries themselves, we can reduce the size of the polynomial to optimize, leading to fast convergence and scalability. Numerical experiments comparing our results with CRAB and GRAPE show that we maintain high accuracy while providing globality certificates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random quantum states are essential for quantum information science, with applications ranging from quantum computing to cryptography. Prior approaches for generating these states often rely on using a large bath to thermalize a smaller system, with a subsequent measurement on the bath used to post-select a random state. To reduce the required size of the bath, we propose a resource-efficient scheme using holographic deep thermalization driven by Hamiltonian evolution, combined with mid-circuit measurements. This scheme relies on dynamical circuits, enabling a trade-off between spatial and temporal resources and allowing the generation of genuinely random states with only a constant-size bath. We quantify the randomness using the frame potential and derive its asymptotic behavior, which shows good agreement with our numerical simulations and experimental results on IBM quantum devices. For a fixed total evolution time, increasing the number of mid-circuit measurements initially produces an exponential decrease in the frame potential -- a quantum anti-Zeno behavior arising from holographic deep thermalization. Past a critical number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential rises again, signaling the onset of the quantum Zeno effect.</description>

Abstract: We describe the Wigner's-Friend scenario according to Wigner, then a similar but earlier version according to Everett. Wigner and Everett provide different resolutions of essentially the same paradox. Decoherence theory provides a third resolution. Despite different interpretations (or their absence), these three stories fit together to form a consistent picture without a paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we report on the evolution of photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertial reference frames under a Lorentz boost, covering the general cases of zero and non-zero relative motion between observers of the entangled state. We find that entanglement undergoes significant changes that are observer dependent, asymptotically approaching a minimum at very large velocities close to the light cone from the viewpoint of the stationary observers in the rest frame, and degrading completely from the viewpoint of the moving observer. Our results, as demonstrated through entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity, show that OAM and OAM entanglement are observer dependent, raising pertinent questions on the invariance of such entangled states to spacetime transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive and analyze three feature map representations of parametrized quantum dynamics, which generalize variational quantum circuits. These are (i) a Lie-Fourier partial sum, (ii) a Taylor expansion, and (iii) a finite-dimensional sinc kernel regression representation. The Lie-Fourier representation is shown to have a dense spectrum with discrete peaks, that reflects control Hamiltonian properties, but that is also compressible in typically found symmetric systems. We prove boundedness in the spectrum and the cost function derivatives, and discrete symmetries of the coefficients, with implications for learning and simulation. We further show the landscape is Lipschitz continuous, linking global variation bounds to local Taylor approximation error - key for step size selection, convergence estimates, and stopping criteria in optimization. This also provides a new form of polynomial barren plateaux originating from the Lie-Fourier structure of the quantum dynamics. These results may find application in local and general surrogate model learning, which we benchmark numerically, in characterizations of hardness in the problem instances, and for meta-parameter heuristics in quantum optimizers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the average determinant of reduced density matrices for each qubit as a global entanglement measure. By means of the properties of reduced density matrices, we can investigate the present measure. We propose a decomposition law for the present measure, demonstrate that the present measure just measures the average mixedness for each qubit and the average 1-tangle, and indicate that for n-qubit W state and n-qubit Dicke states, the average mixedness for each qubit and 1-tangle almost vanish for the large number of qubits. We also point out that for two quits, the present measure is just the square of the concurrence while for three qubits, the present measure is the sum of 3-tangle and the double of the average 2-tangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For chaotic quantum dynamics modeled by random unitary circuits, we study the complexity of reduced density matrices of subsystems as a function of evolution time where the initial global state is a product pure state. The state complexity is defined as the minimum number of local quantum channels to generate a given state from a product state to a good approximation. In $1+1$d, we prove that the complexity of subsystems of length $\ell$ smaller than half grows linearly in time $T$ at least up to $T = \ell / 4$ but becomes zero after time $T = \ell /2$ in the limit of a large local dimension, while the complexity of the complementary subsystem of length larger than half grows linearly in time up to exponentially late times. Using holographic correspondence, we give some evidence that the state complexity of the smaller subsystem should actually grow linearly up to time $T = \ell/2$ and then abruptly decay to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore using an ergodic Floquet quantum system on a torus to generate pseudo-random unitary operators. We choose a regime of the perturbed Harper model with strong perturbations and perturbation frequency exceeding the libration frequency to ensure that the system has an ergodic region that covers phase space and lacks resonant substructure. We generate a sample of unitary operators in a finite dimensional space by computing Floquet propagators from a distribution of its control parameters. To compare the distribution of unitaries to that of a Haar-random distribution, we compute k-frame potentials from samples of numerically generated unitaries. We find that uniform distributions of 4 control parameters can generate an approximate 3-design. Distributions of fewer control parameters are required to create an approximate 3-design if the Floquet system parameters drift.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22890v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.</description>

      <title>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions surpassing the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for achieving the logical gates in the $(n+1)$-th level of Clifford hierarchy in $n$ spatial dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22350v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of quantum resource degradation grounded in a decomposition of observational entropy, which partitions the total resource into inter-block coherence ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$) and intra-block noise ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$). Under free operations, the total quantum resource is transformed into classical noise while its overall quantity remains conserved. We demonstrate that the metric $\eta$ functions as a diagnostic indicator, providing a new lens on optimization stagnation, particularly the barren plateau phenomenon in variational quantum algorithms. We substantiate this framework through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, and we explore how these channels can be physically implemented in real quantum systems. Our approach offers a unified viewpoint on quantum thermalization, measurement-induced disturbance, and the degradation of quantum advantage in practical devices, while also improving optimization strategies for current and near-term noisy quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: An operationally well-defined delayed-choice quantum-eraser experiment is proposed, realizing a genuine delayed choice within presently available quantum-optical technology. A multimode quantum memory supplies a controlled and verifiable delay, ensuring that the choice operation is applied strictly after the observation event. Electronic single-photon interference detection measurements furnish a direct statistical discriminator between the causal and informational coherence hypotheses, based solely on marginal detection statistics and without any post-selection.</description>

Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</description>

      <title>Frequency-matching quantum key distribution</title>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretically secure communication against eavesdropping. However, phase instability remains a challenge across many QKD applications, particularly in schemes such as twin-field QKD and measurement-device-independent QKD. The most dominant source of phase fluctuation arises from the frequency offset between independent lasers. Here we propose a method to address this issue by employing a classical photodiode to compensate for the laser frequency difference. As an application of this method, we implement this technique in a mode-pairing QKD system, achieving an error rate approaching the theoretical limit and surpassing the linear key-rate bound over a fiber distance of 296.8 km. This approach provides a practical solution for frequency matching between independent lasers and can be extended to other fields requiring precise phase stabilization.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in unitary system-bath dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</description>

      <title>Adiabaticity Crossover: From Anderson Localization to Planckian Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate electron transport in one dimension from the quantum-acoustic perspective, where the coherent-state representation of lattice vibrations results in a time-dependent deformation potential whose rate is set by the sound speed, fluctuation spectrum is set by the temperature, and overall amplitude is set by the electron-lattice coupling strength. We introduce an acceleration-based adiabatic criterion, consistent with the adiabatic theorem and Landau-Zener theory, that separates adiabatic and diabatic dynamics across the $(T,v)$ plane. The discrete classification agrees with a continuous mean-squared acceleration scale and correlates with a coherence measure given by the ratio of coherence length to the initial packet width $L_\phi(t)/\sigma_0$. We identify a broad Planckian domain in which the dimensionless diffusivity $\alpha\!=\!Dm/\hbar$ is of order unity and only weakly depends on the parameters. This domain is more prevalent in diabatic regions and in areas of reduced phase coherence, indicating a dephasing driven crossover from Anderson localization to Planckian diffusion. Using the Einstein relation together with nearly constant $\alpha$, we directly obtain a low temperature tendency $1/\tau_{\rm tr}\propto T$, offering a insight to $T$-linear resistivity in strange metals. These results provide a unified picture that links adiabaticity, dephasing, and Planckian diffusion in dynamically disordered quantum-acoustics.</description>

      <title>Scheduling in Quantum Satellite Networks: Fairness and Performance Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum satellite networks offer a promising solution for achieving long-distance quantum communication by enabling entanglement distribution across global scales. This work formulates and solves the quantum satellite network scheduling problem by optimizing satellite-to-ground station pair assignments under realistic system and environmental constraints. Our framework accounts for limited satellite and ground station resources, fairness, entanglement fidelity thresholds, and real world non-idealities including atmospheric losses, weather and background noise. In addition, we incorporate the complexities of multi-satellite relays enabled via inter-satellite links. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) based optimization framework that supports multiple scheduling objectives, allowing us to analyze tradeoffs between maximizing total entanglement distribution rate and ensuring fairness across ground station pairs. Our framework can also be used as a benchmark tool to measure the performance of other potential transmission scheduling policies.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Topological Berry Phase with a Single Phonon in an Ion Microtrap Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlled quantum mechanical motion of trapped atomic ions can be used to simulate and explore collective quantum phenomena and to process quantum information. Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into "Coulomb crystals" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $\mu$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.</description>

      <title>Pattern Based Quantum Key Distribution using the five qubit perfect code for eavesdropper detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a new quantum key distribution protocol that uses the five qubit error correction code to detect the presence of eavesdropper reliably. The protocol turns any information theoretical attacks into a classical guess about the pattern. The logical qubit is encoded with a specific pattern into a block of five physical qubits. The security of the protocol relies on the correct pattern choice of Alice and Bob. Decoding with any wrong pattern choice increases multi qubit error rate and the 5 qubit code transforms an eavesdropper's logical disturbance into a signature that is detectable and distinguishable from natural channel noise up to a certain distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a powerful framework for state preparation, while its evolution time often scales quadratically in the inverse Hamiltonian spectral gap, leading to sub-optimal computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear adaptive strategy for finding the time scheduling function, and show that the gap dependence can be quadratically improved to be inverse linear for a wide range of systems under a mild gap measure condition. Through variational analysis, we further demonstrate the optimality of our schedule for systems with linear gap and the partial optimality for general systems, while we also rigorously show that the commonly used linear schedule is never optimal.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Magnetic Sensing for Infrastructure-free Geo-localization</title>

Abstract: Modern navigation systems rely heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), whose weak spaceborne signals are vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and line-of-sight blockage. As an alternative, the Earth's magnetic field entails location information and is found critical to many animals' cognitive and navigation behavior. However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\times$ reduction in runtime.</description>

      <title>Structured beam controlled super-resolution in quantum dots via rapid adiabatic passage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) based super-resolution microscopy in a two-level quantum dot (QD) system. The system consists of a QD interacting with two structured beams, accompanied by chirping and a time delay. The central concept of this work is inspired by the stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy technique. To understand the physical mechanism behind super-resolved spot formation, we employ a variational master equation for the density matrix, incorporating both radiative and non-radiative decay processes. A suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the formation of a super-resolved image. Unwanted low-intensity circular rings around the focal spot are suppressed using Bessel-modulated truncated structured Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and super-Gaussian (SG) beams. We also study the temperature dependence of the imaging scheme. The numerical results confirm that at low pulse areas, exciton-phonon coupling distorts the image, whereas at higher pulse areas, exciton-phonon decoupling preserves the image resolution. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up new possibilities for nanoscale imaging and bioimaging applications using QDs.</description>

Abstract: In the emergent field of quantum technology, the ability to manage heat at the nanoscale and in cryogenic conditions is crucial for enhancing device performance in terms of noise, coherence, and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate the active cooling and refrigeration of the electron gas in a graphene thermal transistor, by taking advantage of nanoscale superconductive tunnel contacts able to pump or extract heat directly from the electrons in the device. Our prototypes achieved a top cooling of electrons in graphene of about 15 mK at a bath temperature of about 450 mK, demonstrating the viability of the proposed device architecture. Our experimental findings are backed by a detailed thermal model that accurately replicated the observed device behavior. Alternative cooling schemes and perspectives are discussed in light of the reported results. Finally, our graphene thermal transistor could find application in superconducting hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism behind the buildup of inner correlations is crucial for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in complex, strongly interacting many-body systems. Here we investigate both analytically and numerically the buildup of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in a dynamically tuned Ising model with various geometries, realized in a Rydberg atomic system. Through second-order Magnus expansion (ME), we demonstrate quantitative agreement with numerical simulations for diverse configurations including $2 \times n$ lattice and cyclic lattice with a star. We find that the AF correlation magnitude at fixed Manhattan distance obeys a universal superposition principle: It corresponds to the algebraic sum of contributions from all shortest paths. This superposition law remains robust against variations in path equivalence, lattice geometries, and quench protocols, establishing a new paradigm for correlation propagation in quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of Zeeman and hyperfine optical pumping and transverse laser cooling of a dysprosium (Dy) atomic beam on the $4f^{10}6s^2(J = 8) \rightarrow 4f^{10}6s6p(J = 9)$ transition at 421.291 nm. For $^{163}$Dy, an electro-optic modulator is used to generate five frequency sidebands required to pump the atoms to the $F = 10.5$ ground state hyperfine level and the light polarization is chosen to pump the atoms to the $m_F = 10.5$ Zeeman sublevel. The atoms are simultaneously laser-cooled using a standing wave orthogonal to the atomic beam. The resulting polarized and cooled atomic beam will be used in fundamental physics experiments taking advantage of the accidental degeneracy of excited states in Dy including the ongoing measurement of parity violation in this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Holographic R\'enyi $n\to 0$ entropy and Euclidean fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit within the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ framework. This limit can be interpreted as a high-temperature regime with respect to the energy defined by the modular Hamiltonian of the state reduced to a subregion. To leading order in $n$, we find that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of a Euclidean, irrotational perfect fluid. This fluid exhibits vortex-like boundary conditions at the entangling surface. Guided by this physical picture, we construct an ansatz for the dual geometry in terms of the boundary fluid variables. We show that our anzats solves Einstein's equations coupled to a cosmic brane at leading order in $n$, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the refined R\'enyi entropy. The resulting conical singularity, signaling the brane's location, can be understood from this perspective as the bulk extension of the boundary fluid vortices.</description>

Abstract: We perform a series of calculations using simulated QPUs, accelerated by the NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, focusing on a molecular analog of an amine-functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF), a promising class of materials for CO$_2$ capture. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique is employed, utilizing both the unitary coupled-cluster method with singles and doubles (UCCSD) and adaptive ans\"atze within active spaces extracted from the larger material system. We explore active spaces of (6e,6o), (8e,8o), and (10e,10o), corresponding to 12, 16, and 20 qubits, respectively, and simulate them using CUDA-Q's GPU-accelerated state-vector simulator. Gate fusion is shown to decrease circuit evaluation time by 2-3$\times$, while parameter shift decreases the number of epochs required for variational convergence. The ADAPT-VQE method decreases both the number of epochs required for convergence and reduces the number of circuit parameters across all active spaces, at the cost of an increased number of circuit evaluations. Combining ADAPT-VQE with the 1- and 2-electron integrals from a CASSCF calculation recovers more correlation energy, at the cost of increased computational time. The CO$_2$ binding energy is computed, and we observe and discuss how increasing the active space size can lead to uneven recovery of correlation energy, making the predicted binding energies variable, even positive (\textit{i.e.}, energetically unfavorable) in some instances. This can be partially remedied by using an alternative approach to computing the binding energy that more evenly spreads the active space. This work explores the application of VQE to a novel material system using simulated QPUs and provides some insight into various consideration when performing these types of calculations, ultimately highlighting the challenges of studying chemisorption on near-term quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Visualization enhances Problem Solving in multi-Qubit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a vast, diverse, and abstract field. In consequence, learners face many challenges. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research has found that visualizations are valuable to aid learners in complex matters. The conditions under which visualizations pose benefits are largely unexplored in QIS education. In this eye-tracking study, we examine the conditions under which the visualization of multi-qubit systems with the Dimensional Circle Notation (DCN) in addition to the mathematical symbolic Dirac Notation (DN) is associated with a benefit for solving problems on the ubiquitously used Hadamard gate operation in terms of performance, Extraneous Cognitive Load (ECL) and Intrinsic Cognitive Load (ICL). We find that DCN increases performance and reduces cognitive load for participants with little experience in quantum physics. In addition, representational competence is able to predict reductions in ECL with DCN, but not performance or ICL. Analysis of the eye-tracking results indicates that task solvers with more transitions between DN and DCN benefit less from the visualization. We discuss the generalizability of the results and practical implications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>

      <title>(2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of contraction map proof method for holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The contraction map proof method is the commonly used method to prove holographic entropy inequalities. Existence of a contraction map corresponding to a holographic entropy inequality is a sufficient condition for its validity. But is it also necessary? In this note, we answer that question in affirmative for all linear holographic entropy inequalities with rational coefficients. We show that the pre-image of a non-contraction map is not a hypercube, but a proper cubical subgraph, and show that this manifests as alterations to the geodesic structure in the bulk, which leads to the violation of inequalities by holographic geometries obeying the RT formula.</description>

      <title>Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which reveals the role played by vacuum fluctuations in seeding the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features. These point towards future experimental probes of the late-time nonlinear regime where further analogies can be drawn with reheating, i.e. the thermalization of the post-inflationary Universe.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>A Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Machine -- A Theory for a Novel Type of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Unique Dissipative System and one Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on an interesting dissipative system found in a photonics system. In this dissipative system, we theoretically identified that robust causality is generated and as a result, it becomes possible to produce behavior that can be understood as SSB, and, we experimentally demonstrated this finding. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrated that by combining such dissipative systems as fundamental elements and establishing a certain relationship between them through optical interference, it is possible to create a unique system that generates complex SSB as a whole. This unique SSB can be understood as having a duality with the model of the creation of many-body-like system (MBLS), and by using the correspondence between the many-body-like system and the Ising model, it holds promise as an alternative computational resource for solving combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through superoscillations. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the common claim that nonlinear modifications of quantum theory necessarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. We focus on hypothetical extensions of quantum theory that contain readout devices. These black boxes provide a classical description of quantum states without perturbing them. They allow quantum state cloning, though in a way consistent with the relativistic no-signalling principle. We review the existence of such devices in the context of Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity, which postulates that the gravitational field remains classical and is sourced by the expectation value of a quantum energy-momentum tensor. We show that the definition of information in the models examined in this paper deviates from that given by von Neumann entropy, and that claims of second law violations based on the distinguishability of non-orthogonal states or on violations of uncertainty principles fail to hold in such theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

      <title>Super-resolution with Fourier measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2\pi/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of $N$ sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.</description>

      <title>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <title>Transverse response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic bandstructures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the B\"uttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting transverse voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the transverse response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer transverse signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.</description>

      <title>Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Wave-Packet Dynamics in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--H\"{a}nchen shifts at the edge.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in C$^*$-algebras: tensor products of state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Namioka-Phelps minimal and maximal tensor products of compact convex sets arising as state spaces of C$^*$-algebras, and, relatedly, study entanglement in (infinite dimensional) C$^*$-algebras. The minimal Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the state spaces of two C$^*$-algebras is shown to correspond to the set of separable (= un-entangled) states on the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras.
  The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. This can be used, for example, to show that the trace simplex of (any) tensor product of C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex if and only if the trace simplex of each of the C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex or trivial (and not all trivial).</description>
