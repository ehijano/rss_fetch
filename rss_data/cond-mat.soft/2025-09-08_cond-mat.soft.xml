      <title>Active Heat Transfer Fluids (AHTF): Enhancement of Convective Heat Transfer by Bubble-Driven Self-Propelled Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid coolants containing conductive nanoparticles (nanofluids) have been widely studied over the past 30 years but have seen limited adoption in real-world cooling applications. The ability of passive nanoparticles to enhance heat transfer in liquids is fundamentally limited because the nanoparticles cannot move on their own relative to the bulk fluid, and thus generate negligible convective enhancements in heat transport. In this work, we present experimental evidence that micron-scale self-propelled particles, which convert chemical energy into autonomous motion, enhance convective heat transfer in liquids. We quantified this enhancement by measuring the convective heat transfer coefficient in a pool of suspension heated from below. The enhancements associated with self-propulsion are most pronounced at low heating powers (Rayleigh number of 10,000), in which case the heat transfer coefficient can be over 100 percent higher in the self-propelled case compared to the same particles without propulsion. This work provides a proof-of-concept demonstration that active particles can enhance heat transfer in liquids, motivating the development of "Active Heat Transfer Fluids" for various cooling applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent odd viscoelasticity in chiral soft glassy materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rheological properties of chiral active materials have been an important area of research in the recent past, in particular regarding odd terms in their mechanical response. While much progress has been made in the study of odd viscous fluids and odd elastic solids, there is still a lack of understanding of odd viscoelastic responses. We introduce a chiral soft glassy rheology model to understand the emergence and nature of such odd viscoelastic responses in a class of amorphous solids. We use this model, which effectively considers an ensemble of actively rotating inclusions in a glassy matrix, to study the linear stress response to steady and oscillatory shear flows. For steady shear we find an odd viscosity that, non-trivially, grows as the active rotation frequency {\Omega} decreases. In oscillatory shear we find an odd viscoelastic spectrum with a non-trivial dependence on the driving frequency {\omega}, combining resonance effects around {\omega} = 2{\Omega} with glassy power laws at larger {\omega}.</description>

      <title>A Review on Molecular Simulations for the Rupture of Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular simulations provide a powerful means to unravel the complex relationships between network architecture and the mechanical response of polymer networks, with a particular emphasis on rupture and fracture phenomena. Although simulation studies focused on polymer network rupture remain relatively limited compared to the broader field, recent advances have enabled increasingly nuanced investigations that bridge molecular structures and macroscopic failure behaviors. This review surveys the evolution of molecular simulation approaches for polymer network rupture, from early studies on related materials to state-of-the-art methods. Key challenges, including mismatched spatial and temporal scales with experiments, the validity of coarse-grained models, the choice of simulation protocols and boundary conditions, and the development of meaningful structural descriptors, are critically discussed. Special attention is paid to the assumptions underlying universality, limitations of current methodologies, and the ongoing need for theoretically sound and experimentally accessible network characterization. Continued progress in computational techniques, model development, and integration with experimental insights will be essential for a deeper, predictive understanding of polymer network rupture.</description>

      <title>Glassy interphases reinforce elastomeric nanocomposites by enhancing percolation-driven volume expansion under strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nearly a century, introduction of nanoparticles to elastomers has yielded extraordinarily tough nanocomposites that are critical to technologies from actuators to tires. The mechanisms by which this reinforcement occurs have nevertheless remained a central open question in material science. One widely debated hypothesis posits that strong interactions between polymer and particles induce "glassy bridges" that cement particles into a cohesive percolating network that resists elongation. Here, molecular dynamics simulations show that glassy particle shells do not primarily provide elongational cohesion. Instead, they amplify an underlying mechanism wherein competition between filler and elastomer networks causes the elastomer's volume to increase on deformation. This induces contributions from the elastomer's bulk modulus, which is of order 1000 times larger than its Young's modulus. These findings establish a unified understanding of low-strain reinforcement in filled elastomers as emanating from volumetric competition between coexisting particulate and elastomeric networks. This reframes and unifies our understanding of low-strain reinforcement, provides a clear-cut diagnostic for the presence of glassy bridging, and offers a new design principle for tough elastomeric nanocomposites.</description>

      <title>Active thermodynamics of inertial chiral active gases: equation of state and edge currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental quests in the physics of active matter concerns the existence of a comprehensive theory for its macroscopic properties, i.e. an ``active thermodynamics''. Here, we derive and experimentally verify key elements of the active thermodynamics of ideal chiral active gases, unveiling edge currents and odd diffusivity as their peculiar features. Our main results are the derivation of an equation of state relating density and pressure via a chirality-dependent effective temperature, the derivation of Fick's law including the full diffusion matrix predicting odd diffusion, and the exact prediction of edge currents at container walls that nonmonotonically depend on chirality.</description>

      <title>Elasticity and plasticity of epithelial gap closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epiboly, during which a tissue closes around the surface of the egg, pervades animal development. This epithelial gap closure involves cell intercalations at the edge of the gap. Here, inspired by serosa closure in the beetle Tribolium, we study the interplay between these plastic cell rearrangements and the elasticity of the tissue in a minimal continuum model of the closure of a circular gap bounded by a contractile actomyosin cable. We discover two different closure mechanisms at the tissue scale depending on the energy barrier $E_\text{b}$ to and the energy $\Delta E$ released by intercalation: If $E_\text{b}\gg\Delta E$, cells intercalate into the gap to close it. For a fluidised tissue in which $E_\text{b}\ll\Delta E$, however, cells deintercalate from the boundary into the bulk of the tissue, and we reveal an emergent mechanical role of inhomogeneities of the actomyosin cable. Our work thus explains the mechanical role of tissue fluidisation in Tribolium serosa closure and processes of epiboly and wound healing more generally.</description>

      <title>Local Mechanical Response of Lipid Membranes to Tilt Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics, this study investigates the local elastic properties of transverse shear deformation of lipid membranes. The analysis demonstrates that transverse shear deformation induces anisotropy in the local stress profile of the lipid bilayer, a phenomenon attributed to the Poynting effect. By analyzing the relationship between transverse shear stress and the induced anisotropy, the local transverse shear modulus is determined. From the local transverse shear modulus, several integral elastic parameters can be derived, including the monolayer tilt modulus, tilt-curvature coupling modulus, and curvature-gradient modulus. The calculated tilt modulus values show good agreement with results from an independent analysis of lipid director fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical crossover between stretched- and compressed-exponential relaxation in a photoexcited crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous relaxation is one of the hallmarks of disordered systems. Following perturbation by an external source, many glassy, jammed and amorphous systems relax as a stretched or compressed exponential as a function of time. However, despite their ubiquity, the origins of and the connection between these phenomenological relaxation functions remains to be understood. Here, we observe a tunable crossover from stretched- to compressed-exponential relaxation by photoexciting single crystal Ca3Ru2O7 across a structural phase transition. We present a simple lattice model that shows how spatial inhomogeneity and local, strain-mediated interactions cooperate to produce the dynamical crossover. Our work reveals anomalous relaxation dynamics in an idealized single crystal material and establishes photoexcited solids as promising platforms for probing the mechanisms underlying anomalous relaxation.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion near a soft surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.</description>

      <title>Edge states, pairing, and sorting of motile chiral particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present experiments on chiral active polar particles, realized as vibrated granular rods, revealing the formation of robust ``skipping orbits'' at hard boundaries. These edge states exhibit a net circulation opposite to the particles' intrinsic rotation and lead to a pronounced accumulation at the boundary, stronger than for their achiral counterparts. The directed nature of these orbits provides a simple yet high-fidelity mechanism for chiral sorting -- even for solitary particles, unlike in T Barois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 238003 (2020). We propose a unified theoretical framework for boundary interactions of both chiral and achiral particles. In this model, an effective outward radial force, proportional to motility and chirality, explains the observed boundary-hugging. Our theory predicts, and our experiments confirm, a transition in the pairing of two particles of the same chirality, from apolar spinners to polar circle walkers, with increasing packing fraction of an ambient medium of beads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the correlations between the position of a tagged tracer and the density of surrounding bath particles is crucial for understanding tracer diffusion in interacting particle systems, and for characterizing the response properties of the bath. We address this problem analytically for both hard-core and soft-core interactions, using minimal yet paradigmatic models in $d$ spatial dimensions. In both cases, we derive analytical expressions for the spatial correlation profiles in the reference frame of the tracer. We reveal unexpected universal features in their large-distance behavior, characterized by power-law tails with exponents that depend solely on the spatial dimensionality of the system. Beyond these simple models, we demonstrate the robustness of our results across different regimes using particle-based numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Local construction of knotted screw dislocations in smectic liquid crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to show that, mathematically, screw dislocation loops with distinct topological properties can be introduced locally on a given smectic liquid crystal configuration. Concretely, given a configuration, we show that a new screw dislocation loop can be introduced along any knot or link transverse to the regular layers through a purely local modification. We define a topological invariant of screw dislocation loops, the multiplicity, and show that it can be explicitly prescribed in our construction. Finally, we apply this method to establish that any link type can be locally introduced within the set of screw dislocations of smectic configurations of a certain class. This shows that both the global topology (link type) and the local topology (multiplicity) of loop dislocations can be very rich, even when constrained to arise from local modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasticity with softening and fracture mechanics lead to ill-posed mathematical problems due to the loss of monotonicity. Multiple co-existing solutions are possible when softening elements are coupled together, and solutions cannot be continued beyond the point of complete degradation of the set of admissible stresses. We present a state-dependent sweeping process which solves the evolution of elasto-plastic Lattice Spring Models with arbitrary placement of softening, hardening and perfectly plastic springs. Using numerical simulations of regular grid lattices with softening we demonstrate the emergence of non-symmetric shear bands with strain localization. At the same time, in toy examples it is easy to analytically derive multiple co-existing solutions. These solutions correspond to fixed points in the implicit catch-up algorithm and we observe a discontinuous bifurcation with the exchange of stability of those fixed points.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Solvent Dynamics Drives the Formation of the Hydrated Electron in Photoexcited Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.</description>
