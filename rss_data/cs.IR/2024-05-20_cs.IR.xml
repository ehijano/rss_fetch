      <title>Pointwise Metrics for Clustering Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines pointwise clustering metrics, a collection of metrics for characterizing the similarity of two clusterings. These metrics have several interesting properties which make them attractive for practical applications. They can take into account the relative importance of the various items that are clustered. The metric definitions are based on standard set-theoretic notions and are simple to understand. They characterize aspects that are important for typical applications, such as cluster homogeneity and completeness. It is possible to assign metrics to individual items, clusters, arbitrary slices of items, and the overall clustering. The metrics can provide deep insights, for example they can facilitate drilling deeper into clustering mistakes to understand where they happened, or help to explore slices of items to understand how they were affected. Since the pointwise metrics are mathematically well-behaved, they can provide a strong foundation for a variety of clustering evaluation techniques. In this paper we discuss in depth how the pointwise metrics can be used to evaluate an actual clustering with respect to a ground truth clustering.</description>

      <title>Positional encoding is not the same as context: A study on positional encoding for Sequential recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of streaming media and e-commerce has led to a boom in recommendation systems, including Sequential recommendation systems, which consider the user's previous interactions with items. In recent years, research has focused on architectural improvements such as transformer blocks and feature extraction that can augment model information. Among these features are context and attributes. Of particular importance is the temporal footprint, which is often considered part of the context and seen in previous publications as interchangeable with positional information. Other publications use positional encodings with little attention to them. In this paper, we analyse positional encodings, showing that they provide relative information between items that are not inferable from the temporal footprint. Furthermore, we evaluate different encodings and how they affect metrics and stability using Amazon datasets. We added some new encodings to help with these problems along the way. We found that we can reach new state-of-the-art results by finding the correct positional encoding, but more importantly, certain encodings stabilise the training.</description>

      <title>In-context Contrastive Learning for Event Causality Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims at determining the existence of a causal relation between two events. Although recent prompt learning-based approaches have shown promising improvements on the ECI task, their performance are often subject to the delicate design of multiple prompts and the positive correlations between the main task and derivate tasks. The in-context learning paradigm provides explicit guidance for label prediction in the prompt learning paradigm, alleviating its reliance on complex prompts and derivative tasks. However, it does not distinguish between positive and negative demonstrations for analogy learning. Motivated from such considerations, this paper proposes an In-Context Contrastive Learning (ICCL) model that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the effectiveness of both positive and negative demonstrations. Additionally, we apply contrastive learning to event pairs to better facilitate event causality identification. Our ICCL is evaluated on the widely used corpora, including the EventStoryLine and Causal-TimeBank, and results show significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>CELA: Cost-Efficient Language Model Alignment for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction holds a paramount position in recommender systems. The prevailing ID-based paradigm underperforms in cold-start scenarios due to the skewed distribution of feature frequency. Additionally, the utilization of a single modality fails to exploit the knowledge contained within textual features. Recent efforts have sought to mitigate these challenges by integrating Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). They design hard prompts to structure raw features into text for each interaction and then apply PLMs for text processing. With external knowledge and reasoning capabilities, PLMs extract valuable information even in cases of sparse interactions. Nevertheless, compared to ID-based models, pure text modeling degrades the efficacy of collaborative filtering, as well as feature scalability and efficiency during both training and inference. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{C}ost-\textbf{E}fficient \textbf{L}anguage Model \textbf{A}lignment (\textbf{CELA}) for CTR prediction. CELA incorporates textual features and language models while preserving the collaborative filtering capabilities of ID-based models. This model-agnostic framework can be equipped with plug-and-play textual features, with item-level alignment enhancing the utilization of external information while maintaining training and inference efficiency. Through extensive offline experiments, CELA demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an online A/B test conducted on an industrial App recommender system showcases its practical effectiveness, solidifying the potential for real-world applications of CELA.</description>

      <title>Know in AdVance: Linear-Complexity Forecasting of Ad Campaign Performance with Evolving User Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time Bidding (RTB) advertisers wish to \textit{know in advance} the expected cost and yield of ad campaigns to avoid trial-and-error expenses. However, Campaign Performance Forecasting (CPF), a sequence modeling task involving tens of thousands of ad auctions, poses challenges of evolving user interest, auction representation, and long context, making coarse-grained and static-modeling methods sub-optimal. We propose \textit{AdVance}, a time-aware framework that integrates local auction-level and global campaign-level modeling. User preference and fatigue are disentangled using a time-positioned sequence of clicked items and a concise vector of all displayed items. Cross-attention, conditioned on the fatigue vector, captures the dynamics of user interest toward each candidate ad. Bidders compete with each other, presenting a complete graph similar to the self-attention mechanism. Hence, we employ a Transformer Encoder to compress each auction into embedding by solving auxiliary tasks. These sequential embeddings are then summarized by a conditional state space model (SSM) to comprehend long-range dependencies while maintaining global linear complexity. Considering the irregular time intervals between auctions, we make SSM's parameters dependent on the current auction embedding and the time interval. We further condition SSM's global predictions on the accumulation of local results. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. AdVance has been deployed on the Tencent Advertising platform, and A/B tests show a remarkable 4.5\% uplift in Average Revenue per User (ARPU).</description>

      <title>SynDy: Synthetic Dynamic Dataset Generation Framework for Misinformation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diaspora communities are disproportionately impacted by off-the-radar misinformation and often neglected by mainstream fact-checking efforts, creating a critical need to scale-up efforts of nascent fact-checking initiatives. In this paper we present SynDy, a framework for Synthetic Dynamic Dataset Generation to leverage the capabilities of the largest frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) to train local, specialized language models. To the best of our knowledge, SynDy is the first paper utilizing LLMs to create fine-grained synthetic labels for tasks of direct relevance to misinformation mitigation, namely Claim Matching, Topical Clustering, and Claim Relationship Classification. SynDy utilizes LLMs and social media queries to automatically generate distantly-supervised, topically-focused datasets with synthetic labels on these three tasks, providing essential tools to scale up human-led fact-checking at a fraction of the cost of human-annotated data. Training on SynDy's generated labels shows improvement over a standard baseline and is not significantly worse compared to training on human labels (which may be infeasible to acquire). SynDy is being integrated into Meedan's chatbot tiplines that are used by over 50 organizations, serve over 230K users annually, and automatically distribute human-written fact-checks via messaging apps such as WhatsApp. SynDy will also be integrated into our deployed Co-Insights toolkit, enabling low-resource organizations to launch tiplines for their communities. Finally, we envision SynDy enabling additional fact-checking tools such as matching new misinformation claims to high-quality explainers on common misinformation topics.</description>

      <title>A Unified Search and Recommendation Framework Based on Multi-Scenario Learning for Ranking in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search and recommendation (S&amp;R) are the two most important scenarios in e-commerce. The majority of users typically interact with products in S&amp;R scenarios, indicating the need and potential for joint modeling. Traditional multi-scenario models use shared parameters to learn the similarity of multiple tasks, and task-specific parameters to learn the divergence of individual tasks. This coarse-grained modeling approach does not effectively capture the differences between S&amp;R scenarios. Furthermore, this approach does not sufficiently exploit the information across the global label space. These issues can result in the suboptimal performance of multi-scenario models in handling both S&amp;R scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an effective and universal framework for Unified Search and Recommendation (USR), designed with S&amp;R Views User Interest Extractor Layer (IE) and S&amp;R Views Feature Generator Layer (FG) to separately generate user interests and scenario-agnostic feature representations for S&amp;R. Next, we introduce a Global Label Space Multi-Task Layer (GLMT) that uses global labels as supervised signals of auxiliary tasks and jointly models the main task and auxiliary tasks using conditional probability. Extensive experimental evaluations on real-world industrial datasets show that USR can be applied to various multi-scenario models and significantly improve their performance. Online A/B testing also indicates substantial performance gains across multiple metrics. Currently, USR has been successfully deployed in the 7Fresh App.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SemEval 2024 BRAINTEASER task represents a pioneering venture in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by focusing on lateral thinking, a dimension of cognitive reasoning that is often overlooked in traditional linguistic analyses. This challenge comprises of Sentence Puzzle and Word Puzzle subtasks and aims to test language models' capacity for divergent thinking.
  In this paper, we present our approach to the BRAINTEASER task. We employ a holistic strategy by leveraging cutting-edge pre-trained models in multiple choice architecture, and diversify the training data with Sentence and Word Puzzle datasets. To gain further improvement, we fine-tuned the model with synthetic humor/jokes dataset and the RiddleSense dataset which helped augmenting the model's lateral thinking abilities. Empirical results show that our approach achieve 92.5\% accuracy in Sentence Puzzle subtask and 80.2\% accuracy in Word Puzzle subtask.</description>

      <title>Neural Optimization with Adaptive Heuristics for Intelligent Marketing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational marketing has become increasingly important in today's digital world, facing challenges such as massive heterogeneous data, multi-channel customer journeys, and limited marketing budgets. In this paper, we propose a general framework for marketing AI systems, the Neural Optimization with Adaptive Heuristics (NOAH) framework. NOAH is the first general framework for marketing optimization that considers both to-business (2B) and to-consumer (2C) products, as well as both owned and paid channels. We describe key modules of the NOAH framework, including prediction, optimization, and adaptive heuristics, providing examples for bidding and content optimization. We then detail the successful application of NOAH to LinkedIn's email marketing system, showcasing significant wins over the legacy ranking system. Additionally, we share details and insights that are broadly useful, particularly on: (i) addressing delayed feedback with lifetime value, (ii) performing large-scale linear programming with randomization, (iii) improving retrieval with audience expansion, (iv) reducing signal dilution in targeting tests, and (v) handling zero-inflated heavy-tail metrics in statistical testing.</description>

      <title>RDRec: Rationale Distillation for LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based recommender models that bridge users and items through textual prompts for effective semantic reasoning have gained considerable attention. However, few methods consider the underlying rationales behind interactions, such as user preferences and item attributes, limiting the reasoning capability of LLMs for recommendations. This paper proposes a rationale distillation recommender (RDRec), a compact model designed to learn rationales generated by a larger language model (LM). By leveraging rationales from reviews related to users and items, RDRec remarkably specifies their profiles for recommendations. Experiments show that RDRec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both top-N and sequential recommendations. Our source code is released at https://github.com/WangXFng/RDRec.</description>

      <title>INDUS: Effective and Efficient Language Models for Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on general domain corpora showed remarkable results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, previous research demonstrated LLMs trained using domain-focused corpora perform better on specialized tasks. Inspired by this pivotal insight, we developed INDUS, a comprehensive suite of LLMs tailored for the Earth science, biology, physics, heliophysics, planetary sciences and astrophysics domains and trained using curated scientific corpora drawn from diverse data sources. The suite of models include: (1) an encoder model trained using domain-specific vocabulary and corpora to address natural language understanding tasks, (2) a contrastive-learning-based general text embedding model trained using a diverse set of datasets drawn from multiple sources to address information retrieval tasks and (3) smaller versions of these models created using knowledge distillation techniques to address applications which have latency or resource constraints. We also created three new scientific benchmark datasets namely, CLIMATE-CHANGE-NER (entity-recognition), NASA-QA (extractive QA) and NASA-IR (IR) to accelerate research in these multi-disciplinary fields. Finally, we show that our models outperform both general-purpose encoders (RoBERTa) and existing domain-specific encoders (SciBERT) on these new tasks as well as existing benchmark tasks in the domains of interest.</description>

      <title>GenToC: Leveraging Partially-Labeled Data for Product Attribute-Value Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the e-commerce domain, the accurate extraction of attribute-value pairs from product listings (e.g., Brand: Apple) is crucial for enhancing search and recommendation systems. The automation of this extraction process is challenging due to the vast diversity of product categories and their respective attributes, compounded by the lack of extensive, accurately annotated training datasets and the demand for low latency to meet the real-time needs of e-commerce platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce GenToC, a novel two-stage model for extracting attribute-value pairs from product titles. GenToC is designed to train with partially-labeled data, leveraging incomplete attribute-value pairs and obviating the need for a fully annotated dataset. Moreover, we introduce a bootstrapping method that enables GenToC to progressively refine and expand its training dataset. This enhancement substantially improves the quality of data available for training other neural network models that are typically faster but are inherently less capable than GenToC in terms of their capacity to handle partially-labeled data. By supplying an enriched dataset for training, GenToC significantly advances the performance of these alternative models, making them more suitable for real-time deployment. Our results highlight the unique capability of GenToC to learn from a limited set of labeled data and to contribute to the training of more efficient models, marking a significant leap forward in the automated extraction of attribute-value pairs from product titles. GenToC has been successfully integrated into India's largest B2B e-commerce platform, IndiaMART.com, achieving a significant increase of 21.1% in recall over the existing deployed system while maintaining a high precision of 89.5% in this challenging task.</description>

      <title>Large language models can accurately predict searcher preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data.
  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs, and best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real searchers needs high-quality "gold" labels, but with these we find that models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.</description>

      <title>Cross Domain LifeLong Sequential Modeling for Online Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) that incorporated lifelong sequential modeling (LSM) have brought great success to recommendation systems in various social media platforms. While continuous improvements have been made in domain-specific LSM, limited work has been done in cross-domain LSM, which considers modeling of lifelong sequences of both target domain and source domain. In this paper, we propose Lifelong Cross Network (LCN) to incorporate cross-domain LSM to improve the click-through rate (CTR) prediction in the target domain. The proposed LCN contains a LifeLong Attention Pyramid (LAP) module that comprises of three levels of cascaded attentions to effectively extract interest representations with respect to the candidate item from lifelong sequences. We also propose Cross Representation Production (CRP) module to enforce additional supervision on the learning and alignment of cross-domain representations so that they can be better reused on learning of the CTR prediction in the target domain. We conducted extensive experiments on WeChat Channels industrial dataset as well as on benchmark dataset. Results have revealed that the proposed LCN outperforms existing work in terms of both prediction accuracy and online performance.</description>

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) shifts the modeling of user preferences from flat to stereoscopic by integrating and learning interaction information from multiple domains at different granularities (ranging from inter-sequence to intra-sequence and from single-domain to cross-domain). In this survey, we first define the CDSR problem using a four-dimensional tensor and then analyze its multi-type input representations under multidirectional dimensionality reductions. Following that, we provide a systematic overview from both macro and micro views. From a macro view, we abstract the multi-level fusion structures of various models across domains and discuss their bridges for fusion. From a micro view, focusing on the existing models, we first discuss the basic technologies and then explain the auxiliary learning technologies. Finally, we exhibit the available public datasets and the representative experimental results as well as provide some insights into future directions for research in CDSR.</description>

      <title>IDGenRec: LLM-RecSys Alignment with Textual ID Learning</title>

Abstract: Generative recommendation based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the traditional ranking-based recommendation style into a text-to-text generation paradigm. However, in contrast to standard NLP tasks that inherently operate on human vocabulary, current research in generative recommendations struggles to effectively encode recommendation items within the text-to-text framework using concise yet meaningful ID representations. To better align LLMs with recommendation needs, we propose IDGen, representing each item as a unique, concise, semantically rich, platform-agnostic textual ID using human language tokens. This is achieved by training a textual ID generator alongside the LLM-based recommender, enabling seamless integration of personalized recommendations into natural language generation. Notably, as user history is expressed in natural language and decoupled from the original dataset, our approach suggests the potential for a foundational generative recommendation model. Experiments show that our framework consistently surpasses existing models in sequential recommendation under standard experimental setting. Then, we explore the possibility of training a foundation recommendation model with the proposed method on data collected from 19 different datasets and tested its recommendation performance on 6 unseen datasets across different platforms under a completely zero-shot setting. The results show that the zero-shot performance of the pre-trained foundation model is comparable to or even better than some traditional recommendation models based on supervised training, showing the potential of the IDGen paradigm serving as the foundation model for generative recommendation.
