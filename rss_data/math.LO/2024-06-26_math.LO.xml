      <title>Modal definability in Kripke's theory of truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Outline of a Theory of Truth, Kripke introduces some of the central concepts of the logical study of truth and paradox. He informally defines some of these -- such as groundedness and paradoxicality -- using modal locutions. We introduce a modal language for regimenting these informal definitions. Though groundedness and paradoxicality are expressible in the modal language, we prove that intrinsicality -- which Kripke emphasizes but does not define modally -- is not. We characterize the modally definable relations and completely axiomatize the modal semantics.</description>

      <title>Games with backtracking options corresponding to the ordinal analysis of $PA$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give another proof of ordinal analysis of $I\Sigma_{k}$-fragments of Peano Arithmetic which is free from cut-elimination of $\omega$-logic. Our main tool is a direct witnessing argument utilizing game notion, motivated from the realm of proof complexity and bounded arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Robust non-computability of dynamical systems and computability of robust dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between the stability of the dynamical system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ and the computability of its basins of attraction. We present a computable $C^{\infty}$ system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ that possesses a computable and stable equilibrium point, yet whose basin of attraction is robustly non-computable in a neighborhood of $f$ in the sense that both the equilibrium point and the non-computability of its associated basin of attraction persist when $f$ is slightly perturbed. This indicates that local stability near a stable equilibrium point alone is insufficient to guarantee the computability of its basin of attraction. However, we also demonstrate that the basins of attraction associated with a structurally stable - globally stable (robust) - planar system defined on a compact set are computable. Our findings suggest that the global stability of a system and the compactness of the domain play a pivotal role in determining the computability of its basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>First-order Logic with Being a Thesis Modal Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce syntactic modal operator $\BOX$ for \textit{being a thesis} into first-order logic. This logic is a modern realization of R. Carnap's old ideas on modality, as logical necessity (J. Symb. Logic, 1946) \cite{Ca46}. We place it within the modern framework of quantified modal logic with a variant of possible world semantics with variable domains. We prove completeness using a kind of normal form and show that in the canonical frame, the relation on all maximal consistent sets, $R = \{\langle \Gamma, \Delta \rangle : \forall A (\BOX A \in \Gamma \Longrightarrow A \in \Delta)\}$, is a universal relation. The strength of the $\BOX$ operator is a proper extension of modal logic $\mathsf{S5}$. Using completeness, we prove that satisfiability in a model of $\BOX A$ under arbitrary valuation implies that $A$ is a thesis of formulated logic. So we can syntactically define logical entailment and consistency. Our semantics differ from S. Kripke's standard one \cite{Kr63} in syntax, semantics, and interpretation of the necessity operator. We also have free variables, contrary to Kripke's and Carnap's approaches, but our notion of substitution is non-standard (variables inside modalities are not free). All $\BOX$-free first-order theses are provable, as well as the Barcan formula and its converse. Our specific theses are \linebreak[4] $\BOX A \to \forall x A$, $\neg \BOX (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX \neg (x = y)$, $\neg \BOX P(x)$, $\neg \BOX \neg P(x)$. We also have $\POS \exists x A(x) \to \POS A(^{y}/_{x})$, and $\forall x \BOX A(x) \to \BOX A(^{y}/_{x})$, if $A$ is a $\BOX$-free formula.</description>
