      <title>Revisiting the energy-momentum squared gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we have revisited the energy-momentum squared gravity theory, by taking into account the second derivative of the matter Lagrangian with respect to the metric, encapsulating relations originated from thermodynamical grounds. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the energy-momentum squared gravity with the new corrections, we have analyzed the physical implications by relying on the linear stability theory. The results show that the current cosmological system is compatible with the expansion of the Universe for some specific matter Lagrangians, explaining the emergence of matter domination era, approaching the late time accelerated expansion era close to the de-Sitter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Monolayer Ice on a Hydrophobic Metal Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding water-metal interactions is central to disciplines spanning catalysis, electrochemistry, and atmospheric science. Monolayer ice phases are well established on hydrophilic surfaces, where strong water-substrate interactions stabilize ordered hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, their formation on hydrophobic metals has been deemed ther-modynamically unfavourable, with water typically assembling into amorphous films, three-dimensional crystallites, or interlocked bilayer ice. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a monolayer ice phase on the hydrophobic Au(111) surface using a low-energy-electron-assisted growth method. Combined experimental characterizations including low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by first-principles calculations, prove that the monolayer ice phase composes of intact water molecules. This approach provides a generalizable strategy for stabilizing ordered two-dimensional ice on inert substrates and offers new insight into the interplay between water and low-energy electrons at hydrophobic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Understanding the sign problem from an exact Path Integral Monte Carlo model of interacting harmonic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the recently discovered operator contraction identity for solving the discreet Path Integral of the harmonic oscillator can be applied equally to fermions in any dimension. This then yields an exactly solvable model for studying the sign problem where the Path Integral Monte Carlo energy at any time step for any number of fermions is known analytically, or can be computed numerically. It is found that repulsive/attractive pairwise interaction shifts the sign problem to larger/smaller imaginary time, but does not make it more severe than the non-interacting case. More surprisingly, for closed-shell number of fermions, the sign problem goes away at large imaginary time. Fourth-order and newly found variable-bead algorithms are used to compute ground state energies of quantum dots with up to 110 electrons and compared to results obtained by modern neural networks.</description>

      <title>Sculpting of Martian brain terrain reveals the drying of ancient Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Martian brain terrain (MBT), characterized by its unique brain-like morphology, is a potential geological archive for finding hints of paleoclimatic conditions during its formation period. The morphological similarity of MBT to self-organized patterned ground on Earth suggests a shared formation mechanism. However, the lack of quantitative descriptions and robust physical modeling of self-organized stone transport jointly limits the study of the thermal and aqueous conditions governing MBT's formation. Here we established a specialized quantitative system for extracting the morphological features of MBT, taking a typical region located in the northern Arabia Terra as an example, and then employed a numerical model to investigate its formation mechanisms. Our simulation results accurately replicate the observed morphology of MBT, matching its key geometric metrics with deviations $&lt;10\%$. Crucially, however, we find that the self-organized transport can solely produce relief $&lt;0.5$ m, insufficient to explain the formation of MBT with average relief of $3.29 \pm 0.65$ m. We attribute this discrepancy to sculpting driven by late-stage sublimation, constraining cumulative subsurface ice loss in this region to $\sim 3$ meters over the past $\sim 3$ Ma. These findings demonstrate that MBT's formation is a multi-stage process: initial patterning driven by freeze-thaw cycles (implying liquid water) followed by vertical sculpting via sublimation (requiring a dry environment). This evolution provides physical evidence for the transition of the ancient Martian climate from a wetter period to a colder hyper-arid state.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Interactions for Efficient Swarm-Based Brownian Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from swarm intelligence, we show that short-range attractive interactions between thermally driven Brownian quasiparticles enable energy-efficient optimization. As quasiparticles can be generated directly within a material, the swarm size can be adjusted with minimal energy overhead. Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time. These findings establish interacting Brownian quasiparticles as a physical platform for scalable and energy-efficient unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Hexagonal Nanowire MAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cell with Broadband Light Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as strong contenders for the next generation of photovoltaic (PV) technologies due to their exceptional light absorption properties, tunability, and affordability in manufacturing. Here, we presented an ingenious hexagonal nanowire (HNW)-based PSC that achieves broadband absorption, minimizes reflectance, and offers robust polarization insensitivity by improving light-matter interaction and increasing charge-collection efficiency. The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance. To further intensify photon confinement, a dielectric SiO2 sphere is partially embedded in the ITO layer, improving long-wavelength absorbance and increasing electron-hole pair generation near the active region. We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport. The optimized HNW structure achieved a notable power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, highlighting a strong connection between optical confinement and effective carrier transport. These attributes render the proposed HNW PSC a viable option for high-performance PV systems and scalable thin-film solar technologies.</description>

      <title>Clever algorithms for glasses work by time reparametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultraslow dynamics of glass-formers has been explained by two views considered as mutually exclusive: one invokes locally hindered mobility, the other rests on the complexity of the configuration space. Here we demonstrate that the evolution responds strongly to the details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time-flow: it has time-reparametrization softness. This finding reconciles both views: while local constraints reparametrize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparametrization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparametrization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Simulations of Tidal Disruption Encores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.</description>
