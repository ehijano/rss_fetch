      <title>Illuminating the Cosmos: Dark matter, primordial black holes, and cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$-CDM model of cosmology has done much to clarify our picture of the early universe. However, there are still some questions that $\Lambda$-CDM does not necessarily answer; questions such as what is the fundamental nature of dark matter? What is its origin? And what causes the intriguing measurements that we are seeing from cosmic dawn? In this thesis, I will describe three directions in which I have pushed forward our understanding of how fundamental physics manifests in cosmology. First, I have studied the signatures of exotic energy injection in various astrophysical and cosmological probes, including the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, and the formation of the earliest stars in our universe. Second, I have investigated the formation of primordial black hole dark matter in a general model for inflation with multiple scalar fields. I have identified the space of models that can generate primordial black holes while remaining in compliance with observational constraints using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and also showed that future gravitational wave observatories will be able to further constrain these models. Finally, I have developed an analytic description of signals from 21\,cm cosmology using methods inspired by effective field theory. This method includes realistic observational effects and has been validated against state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamic simulations, including those with alternative dark matter scenarios. With these recent efforts, we are advancing the frontiers of dark matter phenomenology and cosmology, thereby paving the way towards illuminating the remaining mysteries of our cosmos and drawing closer to a comprehensive understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Effects on the Tachyon Inflation from Thermodynamic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering the Friedmann equations emerging from the entropy-area law of black hole thermodynamics in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle, we study tachyon inflation in the early universe. The presence of a minimal length modifies the Friedmann equations and hence the slow-roll and perturbation parameters in the tachyon model. These modifications, though small, affect the viability of the tachyon inflation in confrontation with observational data. We compare the numerical results of the model with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BAO+BK14(18) data and Planck2018 TT, TE,EE +lowE+lensing+BK14(18) +BAO+LIGO $\&amp;$ Virgo2016 data at $68\%$ and $95\%$ CL. We show that while the tachyon inflation with power-law, inverse power-law and inverse exponential potentials is not observationally viable in comparison with the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ confidence levels of the new joint data, in the presence of the minimal length the model becomes observationally viable.</description>

      <title>The full-sky Spherical Fourier-Bessel power spectrum in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism for analyzing galaxy clustering on the lightcone with the 2-point correlation in the Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) formalism, which is a natural choice to account for all wide-angle and relativistic (GR) effects. We extend previous studies by including all projection and GR effects, developing an efficient numerical implementation that avoids the use of the Limber approximation, includes multi-bins correlations and a full non-diagonal covariance.
  Using this formalism, we investigate the impact of neglecting GR corrections, and in particular how much this could bias measurements of the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL}$.
  Our results show that not including relativistic projection terms can systematically and non-negligibly bias estimates of $f_\mathrm{NL}$. The exact results depend on survey specifications and galaxy population properties, but we stress that a bias will generally be present.
  Finally, we develop a novel prescription for cross-bin correlations that allow to search for a clean signal of relativistic corrections, and show that this requires the use of the 3D full-sky formalism.</description>

      <title>Halo Radius (Splashback Radius) of Groups and Clusters of Galaxies on small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of a study of the distribution of galaxies in the projection along the radius ($R \leq 3R_{200c}$) for 157~groups and clusters of galaxies in the local Universe (0.01 &lt; $z$ &lt; 0.10) with line-of-sight velocity dispersions~200~km~s$^{-1}$ &lt; $ \sigma$ &lt; 1100~km~s$^{-1}$. We introduce a new observed boundary for the halos of clusters of galaxies, which we identify with the splashback radius $R_{\rm{sp}}$. We also identified the core of groups/clusters of galaxies with the radius$R_c$. These radii are determined by the observed integrated distribution of the number of galaxies as a function of squared angular radius from the center of the group/cluster, which (usually) coincides with the brightest galaxy. We found for the entire sample that the boundary of dark matter $R_{\rm{sp}}$ for groups/clusters of galaxies is proportional to the radius $R_{\rm{200c}}$ of the virialized region. We measured the mean radius $\langle R_{\rm{sp}} \rangle = 1.14\pm0.02$~Mpc for groups of galaxies ($\sigma \leq 400$~km~s$^{-1}$) and $\langle R_{\rm{sp}} \rangle = 2.00\pm0.07$~Mpc for clusters of galaxies ($\sigma &gt; 400$~km~s$^{-1}$). The mean ratio of radii is $\langle R_{\rm{sp}}/R_{\rm{200c}} \rangle = 1.40\pm0.02$}, or $\langle R_{\rm{sp}}/R_{\rm{200m}} \rangle = 0.88\pm0.02$.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen--Kaplan--Nelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

      <title>Theoretical wavelet $\ell_1$-norm from one-point PDF prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing, resulting from the bending of light due to the presence of matter along the line of sight, is a potent tool for exploring large-scale structures, particularly in quantifying non-Gaussianities. It stands as a pivotal objective for upcoming surveys. In the realm of current and forthcoming full-sky weak-lensing surveys, the convergence maps, representing a line-of-sight integration of the matter density field up to the source redshift, facilitate field-level inference, providing an advantageous avenue for cosmological exploration. Traditional two-point statistics fall short of capturing non-Gaussianities, necessitating the use of higher-order statistics to extract this crucial information. Among the various higher-order statistics available, the wavelet $\ell_1$-norm has proven its efficiency in inferring cosmology (Ajani et al.2021). However, the lack of a robust theoretical framework mandates reliance on simulations, demanding substantial resources and time. Our novel approach introduces a theoretical prediction of the wavelet $\ell_1$-norm for weak lensing convergence maps, grounded in the principles of Large-Deviation theory. We present, for the first time, a theoretical prediction of the wavelet $\ell_1$-norm for convergence maps, derived from the theoretical prediction of their one-point probability distribution. Additionally, we explore the cosmological dependence of this prediction and validate the results on simulations. A comparison of our predicted wavelet $\ell_1$-norm with simulations demonstrates a high level of accuracy in the weakly non-linear regime. Moreover, we show its ability to capture cosmological dependence, paving the way for a more robust and efficient parameter inference process.</description>

      <title>The impact of a primordial gravitational wave background on LISA resolvable sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a common prediction in various models of the early Universe. Despite constraints at different frequency ranges and claims of detection in the nHz range by Pulsar Timing Arrays, the amplitude and spectral dependence of the SGWB in the mHz range remain largely unknown. Plausible models of early Universe Physics predict a wide range of SGWB amplitudes, from undetectable to exceeding the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. This paper explores the potential impact of a prominent primordial SGWB on LISA's main scientific targets. Our main analyses focuses on Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). By employing publicly available MBHB population models and state-of-the-art LISA's forecasting pipeline, we analyze the effects of the SGWB on MBHB detections. We find that the decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio induced by a strong primordial GWB can significantly reduce the number of detectable events, compromise the precision of constraints, and even hinder sky localization for some events. We also examine the impact of the SGWB on Stellar Origin Black Hole Binaries (SOBHBs) and Galactic Binaries (GBs), which are fainter sources than MBHBs. Depending on the spectral properties of the SGWB, we conclude that these sources could be either marginally affected or rendered completely undetectable. This largely unexplored aspect raises critical questions about the potential challenges posed by a prominent SGWB to LISA's astrophysical objectives, including MBHBs, SOBHBs, and GBs.</description>

      <title>DESI and the Hubble tension in light of modified recombination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements and analyses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration and supernova surveys combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, indicate that the dark energy density changes over time. Here we explore the possibility that the dark energy density is constant, but that the cosmological recombination history differs substantially from that in $\Lambda$CDM. When we free up the ionization history, but otherwise assume the standard cosmological model, we find the combination of CMB and DESI data prefer i) early recombination qualitatively similar to models with small-scale clumping, ii) a value of $H_0$ consistent with the estimate from the SH0ES Collaboration at the $2\sigma$ level, and iii) a higher CMB lensing power, which takes pressure off of otherwise tight constraints on the sum of neutrino masses. Our work provides additional motivation for finding physical models that lead to the small-scale clumping that can theoretically explain the ionization history preferred by DESI and CMB data.</description>

      <title>Axion Stars: Mass Functions and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles, as leading dark matter candidates, can also have interesting implications for dark matter substructures if the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken after inflation. In such a scenario, axion perturbations on small scales will lead to the formation of axion miniclusters at matter-radiation equality, and subsequently the formation of axion stars. Such compact objects open new windows for indirect searches for axions. We compute the axion star mass function based on recent axion minicluster studies and Bose star simulations. Applying this mass function, we find post-inflation axion-like particles with masses $m_a&lt; 3.3 \times 10^{-17}$ eV are constrained by the lack of dynamical heating of stars in ultrafaint dwarfs. We also find that current microlensing surveys are insensitive to QCD axion stars. While we focus on the gravitational detectability of axion stars, our result can be directly applied to other interesting signatures of axion stars, e.g. their decay to photons, that require as input the abundance, mass, and density distribution of axion stars.</description>

      <title>The influence of environmental effects on Type Ia Supernovae Standardization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are used as reliable cosmic distance indicators and their standardization is necessary for a more accurate measurement of the cosmological parameters of the Universe. However, the Hubble diagram still shows some intrinsic dispersion, potentially influenced by the supernova's environment. In this study, we reproduce the Hubble diagram fit for the Pantheon supernova sample, and also investigate the possibility of introducing various standardization equations for supernovae exploded in early- and late-type galaxies. We analyze 330 Pantheon SNe Ia to study how host galaxy morphology affects their standardization. We find that SNe Ia hosted by early-type galaxies have different standardization parameters compared to those hosted by late-type galaxies. We conclude that correcting supernova luminosity for host galaxy morphology is essential to perform the precise cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>Implications of a Scalar Field Interacting with the Dark Matter Fluid on the Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the implications of a scalar field interacting with the dark matter fluid on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. We choose an interaction type which before a critical matter density $\rho_m^c$ during the reheating era or early radiation domination era, the scalar field loses energy transferring it to the dark matter fluid, while after the critical matter density $\rho_m^c$ the dark matter fluid loses energy transferring it to the scalar field. The scalar field is assumed to have an exponential potential and at the critical matter density with $\rho_m\sim \rho_m^c$, at which point, the interaction between the scalar and the dark matter fluid is switched off, we demand that the effective equation of state of scalar field is described by a matter dominated era. This is crucial since it affects the behavior of the trajectories and the fixed points of the two dimensional dynamical system composed by the dark matter fluid and the scalar field. Specifically the phase space contains two stable dark matter dominated final attractors and two unstable stiff era dominated fixed points. Thus, there exists the remarkable possibility that the Universe might feel the passing of the scalar field through the unstable kinetic dominated fixed points, during the reheating era, with the total equation of state parameter of the Universe being deformed to be larger than $w=1/3$. This deformation of the total equation of state parameter during the reheating era can potentially have significant effects on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Also the model we use also contains an $F(R)$ gravity which controls in a dominant way inflation and the late-time acceleration, in a phenomenologically viable way.</description>

      <title>Indefinitely Flat Circular Velocities and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation from Weak Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a new deprojection formula to infer the gravitational potential around isolated galaxies from weak gravitational lensing. The results imply circular velocity curves that remain flat for hundreds of kpc, greatly extending the classic result from 21 cm observations. Indeed, there is no clear hint of a decline out to 1 Mpc, well beyond the expected virial radii of dark matter halos. Binning the data by mass reveals a correlation with the flat circular speed that closely agrees with the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation known from kinematic data. These results apply to both early and late type galaxies, indicating a common universal behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I summarize the stellar side of the cosmological lithium problem(s). Evidence from independent studies is accumulating and indicates that stars may very well be fully responsible for lowering their surface lithium from the predicted primordial value to observed levels through internal element-transport mechanisms collectively referred to as atomic diffusion. While atomic diffusion can be modelled from first principles, stellar evolution uses a parametrized representation of convection making it impossible to predict convective-boundary mixing as a vital stellar process moderating atomic diffusion. More work is clearly needed here for a fully quantitative picture of lithium (and metallicity) evolution as stars age. Lastly, note that inferred stellar lithium-6 abundances have all but disappeared.</description>

      <title>Subhalos are Distributed Anisotropically About Their Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distributions of subhalos about their hosts in two suites of zoom-in N-body simulations of halo growth -- one suite focused on Milky Way Mass halos ($\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and another focused on cluster ($\sim 10^{15} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) halos in the Symphony simulation suite. We find, in agreement with previous work on this subject, that subhalos are distributed anisotropically about their host halos. In particular, the positions of subhalos lie preferentially near the major axes of their host halos, possibly implying that satellite galaxies will exhibit a similar alignment. Furthermore, we show that in two-dimensional projection subhalos are more likely to be observed near the halo center (where the central galaxy presumably resides) when the host halo is projected nearly along its major axis. This projection effect is significant. Within a projected radius of $5\%$ of the virial radius of the host halo, the fraction of mass in subhalos is $\sim 44\%$ larger for Milky Way mass halos and as much as $\sim 145\%$ larger for cluster halos when projected along the major axis as compared to the average from a random projection. This result has consequences for many applications including the interpretation of gravitational lenses. Finally, we find that the orbital angular momentum vector of subhalos is aligned with the angular momentum vector of their host halo, indicating that a significant component of a halo's angular momentum may be carried in its subhalos. This has consequences for galaxy formation models which use host halo angular momentum as a proxy for galaxy momentum.</description>

      <title>The quantumness of relic gravitons</title>

Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale cosmological simulations are an indispensable tool for modern cosmology. To enable model-space exploration, fast and accurate predictions are critical. In this paper, we show that the performance of such simulations can be further improved with time-stepping schemes that use input from cosmological perturbation theory. Specifically, we introduce a class of time-stepping schemes derived by matching the particle trajectories in a single leapfrog/Verlet drift-kick-drift step to those predicted by Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). As a corollary, these schemes exactly yield the analytic Zel'dovich solution in 1D in the pre-shell-crossing regime (i.e. before particle trajectories cross). One representative of this class is the popular FastPM scheme by Feng et al. 2016, which we take as our baseline. We then construct more powerful LPT-inspired integrators and show that they outperform FastPM and standard integrators in fast simulations in two and three dimensions with $\mathcal{O}(1 - 100)$ timesteps, requiring less steps to accurately reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrum of the density field. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that, for any integrator, convergence is limited in the post-shell-crossing regime (to order 3/2 for planar wave collapse), owing to the lacking regularity of the acceleration field, which makes the use of high-order integrators in this regime futile. Also, we study the impact of the timestep spacing and of a decaying mode present in the initial conditions. Importantly, we find that symplecticity of the integrator plays a minor role for fast approximate simulations with a small number of timesteps.</description>

      <title>The MillenniumTNG Project: The impact of baryons and massive neutrinos on high-resolution weak gravitational lensing convergence maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study weak gravitational lensing convergence maps produced from the MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations by direct projection of the mass distribution on the past backwards lightcone of a fiducial observer. We explore the lensing maps over a large dynamic range in simulation mass and angular resolution, allowing us to establish a clear assessment of numerical convergence. By comparing full physics hydrodynamical simulations with corresponding dark-matter-only runs we quantify the impact of baryonic physics on the most important weak lensing statistics. Likewise, we predict the impact of massive neutrinos reliably far into the non-linear regime. We also demonstrate that the "fixed &amp; paired" variance suppression technique increases the statistical robustness of the simulation predictions on large scales not only for time slices but also for continuously output lightcone data. We find that both baryonic and neutrino effects substantially impact weak lensing shear measurements, with the latter dominating over the former on large angular scales. Thus, both effects must explicitly be included to obtain sufficiently accurate predictions for stage IV lensing surveys. Reassuringly, our results agree accurately with other simulation results where available, supporting the promise of simulation modelling for precision cosmology far into the non-linear regime.</description>

      <title>Covariant cosmography: the observer-dependence of the Hubble parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disagreement between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble parameter is emerging as a serious challenge to the standard model of cosmology. We develop a covariant cosmographic analysis of the Hubble parameter in a general spacetime, which is fully model-independent and can thus be used as part of a robust assessment of the tension. Here our focus is not on the tension but on understanding the relation between the physical expansion rate and its measurement by observers -- which is critical for model-independent measurements and tests. We define the physical Hubble parameter and its multipoles in a general spacetime and derive for the first time the covariant boost transformation of the multipoles measured by a heliocentric observer. The analysis is extended to the covariant deceleration parameter. Current cosmographic measurements of the expansion anisotropy contain discrepancies and disagreements, some of which may arise because the correct transformations for a moving observer are not applied. A heliocentric observer will detect a dipole, generated not only by a Doppler effect, but also by an aberration effect due to shear. In principle, the observer can measure both the intrinsic shear anisotropy and the velocity of the observer relative to the matter -- without any knowledge of peculiar velocities, which are gauge dependent and do not arise in a covariant approach. The practical implementation of these results is investigated in a follow-up paper. We further show that the standard cosmographic relation between the Hubble parameter, the redshift and the luminosity distance (or magnitude) is not invariant under boosts and holds only in the matter frame. A moving observer who applies the standard cosmographic relation should correct the luminosity distance by a redshift factor -- otherwise an incorrect dipole and a spurious octupole are predicted.</description>

      <title>Modeling the core-halo mass relation in FDM halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is an intriguing candidate alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM). The FDM model predicts that dark halos have characteristic core structures generated by the effect of quantum pressure, which is different from the structure of CDM halos. We devise a semi-analytic model of a FDM halo density profile by assuming that the density distribution results from the redistribution of mass in a halo with the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We calculate the mass redistribution radius by considering dynamical relaxation within the FDM halo. We adopt a concentration-halo mass relation with lower concentration compared to that in the CDM model below the half mode mass, which originates from the suppressed matter density fluctuations at small length scales. Our model reproduces the core-halo mass relation (CHMR) found in the numerical simulation of \citet{2014NatPh..10..496S} at $z&lt;1$. We show that the CHMR is well described by a double power law, unlike previous studies that approximate it by a single power law. Our model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of the largest FDM simulation of \citet{2021MNRAS.506.2603M} at $z=3$. We find that the core mass for a given halo mass follows the log-normal distribution, both in our model and in the simulation results for the first time, and quantitatively compare the variance of the distribution among them. Although our model does not fully explain the scatter of the CHMR, we show the scatter of the concentration-halo mass relation sizably contributes to them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that pairwise peculiar velocity correlations for galaxy clusters can be directly reconstructed from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signature imprinted in the CMB using a machine learning model with a gradient boosting algorithm trained on high-fidelity kSZ simulations. The machine learning model is trained using six to eight cluster features that are directly related to observables from CMB and large-scale structure surveys. We validate the capabilities of the approach in light of the presence of primary CMB, detector noise, and potential uncertainties in the cluster mass estimate and cluster center location. The pairwise velocity statistics extracted using the techniques developed here have the potential to elicit valuable cosmological constraints on dark energy, modified gravity models, and massive neutrinos with kSZ measurements from upcoming CMB surveys, including the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4 and CCAT, and the DESI and SDSS galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the IceCube collaboration observed a neutrino excess in the direction of NGC 1068 with high statistical significance. This constitutes the second detection of an astrophysical neutrino point source after the discovery of a variable emission originating from the blazar TXS~0506+056. Neutrinos emitted by these sources traverse huge, well-determined distances on their way to Earth. This makes them a promising tool to test new physics in the neutrino sector. We consider secret interactions with the cosmic neutrino background and discuss their impact on the flux of neutrino point sources. The observation of emission from NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 can then be used to put limits on the strength of the interaction. We find that our ignorance of the absolute neutrino masses has a strong impact and, therefore, we present limits in two benchmark scenarios with the sum of the neutrino masses around their lower and upper limits.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the Standard Model III: Improved estimate of NLO contributions to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the dominant QED correction to the neutrino-electron interaction rate in the vicinity of neutrino decoupling in the early universe, and estimate its impact on the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ in cosmic microwave background anisotropy observations. We find that the correction to the interaction rate is at the sub-percent level, consistent with a recent estimate by Jackson and Laine. Relative to that work we include the electron mass in our computations, but restrict our analysis to the enhanced $t$-channel contributions. The fractional change in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ due to the rate correction is of order $10^{-5}$ or below, i.e., about a factor of 30 smaller than that recently claimed by Cielo {\it et al.}, and below the nominal computational uncertainties of the current benchmark value of $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM} = 3.0440 \pm 0.0002$. We therefore conclude that aforementioned number remains to be the state-of-the-art benchmark for $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ in the standard model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of holographic dark energy with apparent-horizon cutoff and non-minimal derivative coupling gravity in non-flat FLRW universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background cosmological dynamics for a universe with matter, a scalar field non-minimally derivative coupling to Einstein tensor under power-law potential and holographic vacuum energy is considered here. The holographic IR cutoff scale is apparent horizon which, for accelerating universe, forms a trapped null surface in the same spirit as blackhole's event horizon. For non-flat case, effective gravitational constant cannot be expressed in the Friedmann equation. Therefore holographic vacuum density is defined with standard gravitational constant instead of the effective one. Dynamical and stability analysis shows four independent fixed points. One fixed point is stable and it corresponds to $w_{\text{eff}} = -1$. One branch of the stable fixed-point solutions corresponds to de-Sitter expansion. The others are either unstable or saddle nodes. Numerical integrations of the dynamical system are performed and plotted confronting with $H(z)$ data. It is found that for flat universe, $H(z)$ observational data favors large negative value of NMDC coupling, $\kappa$. Larger holographic contribution, $c$, and larger negative NMDC coupling increase slope and magnitude of the $w_{\text{eff}}$ and $H(z)$. Negative $\kappa$, can contribute to phantom equation of state, $w_{\text{eff}} &lt; -1$. The NMDC-spatial curvature coupling could have phantom energy contribution. Free negative spatial curvature term can also contribute to phantom equation of state, but only with significantly large negative value of the spatial curvature. The model could give phantom equation of state for $\kappa = -200$ and high value of $c$ for both flat and open cases.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <title>Galaxy lens reconstruction based on strongly lensed gravitational waves: similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) galaxy lens reconstruction is a crucial step for many GW lensing science applications. However, dark siren GW lensing (i.e. lensed GW without observed electromagnetic (EM) counterpart) suffers from similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy. We review these two degeneracies and discuss their implications on GW-based lens reconstruction and two well-known GW lensing science cases: the Hubble constant measurement and test for modified GW propagation. Building upon previous works, our conclusions are:1) GWs can only infer the scale-free lens mass model parameters, the dimensionless source position, the GW luminosity distance and the time delay scaling (a combination of Einstein radius, lens redshift, and cosmology).2) Lens reconstruction (of singular isothermal ellipsoid lens) with only two GW signals is unlikely to yield a complete lens model, while four (three) signals can measure all the above parameters accurately (with large uncertainties).3) The similarity transformation degeneracy causes the lens redshift/Einstein radius/cosmology to be degenerate in dark siren measurements. Breaking the degeneracy can be achieved by supplementing the GWs with EM observation of lens redshifts/Einstein radius (source redshift is not required).4) The mass-sheet degeneracy causes the GW luminosity distance to be entirely degenerate with a constant mass sheet.5) Contrary to expectation, the Hubble constant is degenerate with the mass-sheet even when supplemented with lens reconstruction/redshift/Einstein radius and can only be lifted with lens galaxy velocity dispersion measurement, while modified GW propagation test discussed in prior literature is unaffected by the degeneracy. These properties highlight the need for GW observations to be supplemented by EM observations, which could become accessible through a lens archival search or a rapid EM follow-up.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to memory of late Professor V. G. Bagrov, who was my first teacher in theoretical physics. About 45 years later, theoretical physics has changed and me too. The subject of this paper relates some old ideas in cosmology with some recent ideas, as is reflected in the title. The current status of Starobinsky inflation is reviewed and compared to three main conjectures in the Swampland program. It is argued that the Starobinsky inflation model is not in conflict with those Swampland conjectures in their basic versions.</description>
