      <title>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem, namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder (magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory (bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group (RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms and condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Two-level systems and harmonic excitations in a mean-field anharmonic quantum glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural glasses display at low temperature a set of anomalies in thermodynamic observables. The prominent example is the linear-in-temperature scaling of the specific heat, at odds with the Debye cubic scaling found in crystals, due to acoustic phonons. Such an excess of specific heat in amorphous solids is thought of arising from phenomenological soft excitations dubbed tunneling two-level systems (TTLS). Their nature as well as their statistical properties remain elusive from a first-principle viewpoint. In this work we investigate the canonically quantized version of the KHGPS model, a mean-field glass model of coupled anharmonic oscillators, across its phase diagram, with an emphasis on the specific heat. The thermodynamics is solved in a semiclassical expansion. We show that in the replica-symmetric region of the model, up to the marginal glass transition line where replica symmetry gets continuously broken, a disordered version of the Debye approximation holds: the specific heat is dominated by harmonic vibrational excitations inducing a power-law scaling at the transition, ruled by random matrix theory. This mechanism generalizes a previous semiclassical argument in the literature. We then study the marginal glass phase where the semiclassical expansion becomes non-perturbative due to the emergence of instantons that overcome disordered Debye behavior. Inside the glass phase, a variational solution to the instanton approach provides the prevailing excitations as TTLS, which generate a linear specific heat. This phase thus hosts a mix of TTLS and harmonic excitations generated by interactions. We finally suggest to go beyond the variational approximation through an analogy with the spin-boson model.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of networks with weak geometric coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Renormalization Group is crucial for understanding systems across scales, including complex networks. Renormalizing networks via network geometry, a framework in which their topology is based on the location of nodes in a hidden metric space, is one of the foundational approaches. However, the current methods assume that the geometric coupling is strong, neglecting weak coupling in many real networks. This paper extends renormalization to weak geometric coupling, showing that geometric information is essential to preserve self-similarity. Our results underline the importance of geometric effects on network topology even when the coupling to the underlying space is weak.</description>

      <title>The Training Process of Many Deep Networks Explores the Same Low-Dimensional Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop information-geometric techniques to analyze the trajectories of the predictions of deep networks during training. By examining the underlying high-dimensional probabilistic models, we reveal that the training process explores an effectively low-dimensional manifold. Networks with a wide range of architectures, sizes, trained using different optimization methods, regularization techniques, data augmentation techniques, and weight initializations lie on the same manifold in the prediction space. We study the details of this manifold to find that networks with different architectures follow distinguishable trajectories but other factors have a minimal influence; larger networks train along a similar manifold as that of smaller networks, just faster; and networks initialized at very different parts of the prediction space converge to the solution along a similar manifold.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation corrections to Lifshitz tails in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quenched disorder in semiconductors induces localized electronic states at the band edge, which manifest as an exponential tail in the density of states. For large impurity densities, this tail takes a universal Lifshitz form that is characterized by short-ranged potential fluctuations. We provide both analytical expressions and numerical values for the Lifshitz tail of a parabolic conduction band, including its exact fluctuation prefactor. Our analysis is based on a replica field integral approach, where the leading exponential scaling of the tail is determined by an instanton profile, and fluctuations around the instanton determine the subleading pre-exponential factor. This factor contains the determinant of a fluctuation operator, and we avoid a full computation of its spectrum by using a Gel'fand-Yaglom formalism, which provides a concise general derivation of fluctuation corrections in disorder problems. We provide a revised result for the disorder band tail in two dimensions.</description>
