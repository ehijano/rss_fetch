      <title>Noise Resilience in a High-Bandwidth Atom Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utility of inertial sensors depends on resilience against real-world dynamics and noise. Atom interferometry offers a sensing technology with the advantage of good long-term stability, high sensitivity, and accuracy. High measurement bandwidth improves an atom interferometer's ability to reject errors due to dynamics and noise. Here we demonstrate resilience against time-varying environmental noise by rapidly switching the direction of inertial sensitivity in the atom interferometer through a common technique known as k-reversal. We demonstrate sub-interrogation-time k-reversal at 592 Hz in a cold-beam atomic interferometer with an inverse interrogation time of 148 Hz. The interferometer fringe output is read out continuously and post-processed using nonlinear Kalman filters to determine both the inertial and error contributions to the output phase. The resulting power spectral densities show a significant reduction of phase error due to a noisy magnetic field as the k-reversal frequency increases.</description>

      <title>The Role of Buffer Gas in Shaping the D1 Line Spectrum of Potassium Vapour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of buffer gas and magnetic field on the spectral line shapes of the potassium D1 transition using sealed vapour cells filled with varying amounts of neon as a buffer gas. Employing a dual-temperature control system, we independently manipulate the cell body and stem temperatures to explore Doppler and collisional effects on the spectrum. Our results show how the Voigt spectral profile changes from Gaussian- to Lorentzian-dominated forms due to pressure broadening and shifts caused by collisions between potassium atoms and neon. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with the literature values for potassium-neon collisions. For the first time we were able to incorporate the buffer-gas shift and broadening into the modified Voigt profile via the ElecSus code, and found excellent agreement between the predicted and measured line profiles. We also analyse the potassium D1 spectral lines in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime using strong magnetic fields, demonstrating how Zeeman splitting modifies the pressure-broadened line shape. This work provides valuable insights into collision-induced broadening and shifts, enhancing our understanding of potassium spectroscopy and its application in the development of advanced magneto-optical filters for solar physics and other applications.</description>

      <title>Molecular excited state in the interaction quench dynamics of two different atoms in a two-dimensional anisotropic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the interaction quench dynamics of two atoms with different masses and subject to different trapping potentials. Notably, under such anisotropic conditions, the nonequilibrium dynamics can lead to the occupation of molecular excited states. We consider cases of quenching from attractive to repulsive interaction and vice versa, analyzing the impact of the pre- and postquench states. The analysis of overlap integrals for the both states reveals a significant contribution from the molecular excited state. Moreover, the overlap with the prequench states might serve as an indicator of when this excited state may emerge. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum for the lowest levels in the both isotropic and anisotropic harmonic traps. Throughout our study, we use a Gaussian-shaped finite-range interaction potential.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting new dark physics with the next generation of atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide classes of new fundamental physics theories cause apparent variations in particle mass ratios in space and time. In theories that violate the weak equivalence principle (EP), those variations are not uniform across all particles and may be detected with atomic and molecular clock frequency comparisons. In this work we explore the potential to detect those variations with near-future clock comparisons. We begin by searching published clock data for variations in the electron-proton mass ratio. We then undertake a statistical analysis to model the noise in a variety of clock pairs that can be built in the near future according to the current state of the art, determining their sensitivity to various fundamental physics signals. Those signals are then connected to constraints on fundamental physics theories that lead directly or indirectly to an effective EP-violating, including those motivated by dark matter, dark energy, the vacuum energy problem, unification or other open questions of fundamental physics. This work results in projections for tight new bounds on fundamental physics that could be achieved with atomic and molecular clocks within the next few years. Our code for this work is packaged into a forecast tool that translates clock characteristics into bounds on fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Absolute frequency measurement of a Lu$^+$ $(^{3}\rm D_1)$ optical frequency standard via link to international atomic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an absolute frequency measurement of the ${\rm Lu}^{+}\,(^{3}\rm D_1)$ standard frequency which is defined as the hyperfine-average of $^{1}\rm S_0$ to $^{3}\rm D_1$ optical clock transitions in $^{176}{\rm Lu}^{+}$. The measurement result of $353\,638\,794\,073\,800.34(32)$Hz with a fractional uncertainty of $9.1 \times 10^{-16}$ was obtained by operating a single-ion $^{176}{\rm Lu}^{+}$ frequency standard intermittently over 3 months with a total uptime of 162 hours. Traceability to the International System of Units (SI) is realized by remote link to International Atomic Time. This is the first reported absolute frequency value for a ${\rm Lu}^{+}\,(^{3}\rm D_1)$ optical frequency standard.</description>
