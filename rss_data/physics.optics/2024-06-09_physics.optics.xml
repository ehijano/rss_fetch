      <title>Complex far fields and optical singularities due to propagation beyond tight focusing: combined effects of wavefront curvature and aperture diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All optical systems, which involve the collimation of a reflected, transmitted or scattered wave subsequent to tight focusing, are subject to two kinds of deviations. One is the wavefront curvature due to inaccurate focal placement of the interface or scatterer particle under consideration, and the other is the diffraction caused by the finite lens aperture. In the present paper we explore these phenomena in detail by considering a rigorous simulated model and an appropriate experimental setup. We hence demonstrate the complicated intensity profiles and optical singularity characteristics of the observed far field. Then we describe ways to minimize these deviations in a general experiment. But more importantly, our analysis proves that these deviations by themselves are significant optical phenomena of fundamental interest. The observed complex field profiles have similarities to standard diffraction-limited tight focal fields, though our field detection is different from the standard schemes. This indicates the relevance of these complex fields to a larger class of systems involving wavefront curvature and aperture diffraction. The detailed analysis and results of the present paper already serve as core explorations of these optical phenomena; and we also suggest future research directions where these system aspects can be purposefully created and explored further.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Orientations of and Separation between an Overlapping Pair of Dipole Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that it is impossible to distinguish between two fluorescent dipoles versus a single rotating molecule by either modulating the polarization of pumping light or the detection dipole-spread function (DSF). Even if the target is known to be a dipole pair, existing orientation-imaging methods perform poorly for measuring their angular separation. We propose modulating both excitation polarization and the DSF simultaneously, thereby demonstrating robust discrimination between dipole pairs versus single molecules. Combined excitation modulation-DSF engineering improves the precision of measuring centroid orientation by 50% and angular separation by 4- to 6-fold.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>

      <title>Dephasingless two-color terahertz generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A laser pulse composed of a fundamental and an appropriately phased second harmonic can drive a time-dependent current of photoionized electrons that generates broadband THz radiation. Over the propagation distances relevant to many experiments, dispersion causes the relative phase between the harmonics to evolve. This "dephasing" slows the accumulation of THz energy and results in a multi-cycle THz pulse with significant angular dispersion. Here, we introduce a novel optical configuration that compensates the relative phase evolution, allowing for the formation of a half-cycle THz pulse with almost no angular dispersion. The configuration uses the spherical aberration of an axilens to map a prescribed radial phase variation in the near field to a desired longitudinal phase variation in the far field. Simulations that combine this configuration with an ultrashort flying focus demonstrate the formation of a half-cycle THz pulse with a controlled emission angle and 1/4 the angular divergence of the multi-cycle pulse created by a conventional optical configuration.</description>

      <title>Preparation of high precision aspherical lenses based on micro stereolithography technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D printing technology based on digital light processing (DLP) has highlighted its powerful manufacturing capabilities for optical components. However, the printing structure obtained by DLP based down projection printing is easily adhered to the printing window below, and the printed lens surface will have a step effect. This article uses DLP 3D printing technology to print non spherical lenses. During the printing process, a new type of inert liquid fluoride solution was used as the isolation layer, which can more effectively and conveniently prevent the printing structure from sticking to the printing window. At the same time, a vertical lifting immersion method was proposed to smooth the step effect on the surface of the lens.</description>

      <title>Xenon plasma-focused ion beam milling as a method to deterministically fabricate bright and high-purity single-photon sources operating at C-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron beam lithography is a standard method for fabricating photonic nanostructures around semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which are crucial for efficient single and indistinguishable photon sources in quantum information processing. However, this technique lacks direct 3D control over the nanostructure shape, complicating the design and enlarging the 2D footprint to suppress in-plane photon leakage while directing photons into the collecting lens aperture. Here, we present an alternative approach to employ Xenon plasma-focused ion beam (Xe-PFIB) technology as a reliable method for the 3D shaping of photonic nanostructures containing low-density self-assembled InAs/InP quantum dots emitting in the C-band range of the 3rd telecommunication window. We explore both deterministic and non-deterministic fabrication approaches, resulting in mesas naturally shaped as truncated cones. As a demonstration, we fabricate mesas using a heterogeneously integrated structure with a QDs membrane atop an aluminum mirror and silicon substrate. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations show that the angled sidewalls significantly increase photon extraction efficiency, achieving {\eta} = 0.89 for NA = 0.65. We demonstrate experimentally a high purity of pulsed single-photon emission (~99%) and a high extraction efficiency of {\eta} = 0.24, with the latter surpassing the highest reported values obtained using electron beam lithography in the C-band.</description>

      <title>Encapsulated void resonators in lossy dielectric van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric optical resonators traditionally rely on materials with the combination of high refractive indices and low optical losses. Such materials are scarce for operation in visible spectrum and shorter wavelengths. This limitation can be circumvented by relaxing the requirement of low losses. We demonstrate that highly lossy dielectric materials can be structured to support optical resonances that confine light in air voids. We theoretically design void resonances in the visible spectrum and identify resonant modes supported by void arrays. Experimentally, we fabricate void arrays in tungsten diselenide and characterize the confined resonances using far-field reflectance measurements and scanning near-field optical microscopy. Using van der Waals heterostructure assembly, we encapsulate the voids with hexagonal boron nitride which reduces the void volume causing a large spectral blue shift of the void resonance exceeding 150 nm. Our work demonstrates a versatile optical platform for lossy materials, expanding the range of suitable materials and the spectral range of photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of All-Optical Up- and Down-Conversion of 3GPP 5G NR Signals using an Optomechanical Crystal Cavity Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical crystal cavities (OMCCs) allow the interaction between localized optical and mechanical modes through the radiation-pressure force. Driving such cavities with blue-detuned lasers relative to the optical resonance can induce a phonon lasing regime where the OMCC supports self-sustained mechanical oscillations. This dynamic state results in a narrow and stable microwave tone that modulates the laser at integer multiples of the mechanical resonance frequency, ultimately creating an optomechanical (OM) frequency comb suitable for microwave photonics applications. OMCCs enable compact, low-cost power-efficient all-photonic processing of multiple microwave signals, crucial for current 5G and future beyond-5G systems, whilst being compatible with silicon integrated photonic circuits. This work reports the experimental demonstration of all-optical multi-frequency up- and down-conversion of 3GPP 5G new-radio (NR) signals from the low- to mid- and extended-mid bands using the first and second harmonics of the frequency comb generated in a silicon OMCC. The OM comb generates up to 6 harmonics in the K-band, which is suitable for microwave photonic applications. The experimental demonstration also evaluates the impact of the phase-noise and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the frequency-converted 5G NR signals when the first and second OMCC harmonics are employed for frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Cactus-like Metamaterial Structures for Electromagnetically Induced Transparency at THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: THz metamaterials present unique opportunities for next generation technologies and applications, as they can fill the ``THz gap'' originating from the weak response of natural materials in this regime, providing a variety of novel or advanced electromagnetic wave control components and systems. Here, we propose a novel metamaterial design, made of three-dimensional, metallic, "cactus like" meta-atoms, showing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and enhanced refractive index sensing performance at low THz frequencies. Following a detailed theoretical analysis, the structure is realized experimentally using multi-photon polymerization and electroless silver plating. The experimental characterization results obtained through THz time domain spectroscopy validate the corresponding numerical data, verifying the high potential of the proposed structure in slow light and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral optical fission in time-varying subwavelength layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent conducting oxides are highly doped semiconductors that exhibit favourable characteristics when compared to metals, including reduced material losses, tuneable electronic and optical properties, and enhanced damage thresholds. Recently, the photonic community has renewed its attention towards these materials, recognizing their remarkable nonlinear optical properties in the near-infrared spectrum, a feature previously overlooked despite their long-standing application in photovoltaics and touchscreens. The exceptionally large and ultra-fast change of the refractive index, which can be optically induced in these compounds, extends beyond the boundaries of conventional perturbative analysis and makes this class of materials the closest approximation to a time-varying system, and a unique playground for studying a variety of novel phenomena within the domain of photon acceleration. Here we report the spatio-spectral fission of an ultra-fast pulse trespassing a thin film of aluminium zinc oxide with a non-stationary refractive index. By applying phase conservation to this time-varying layer, our model can account for both space and time refraction and explain in quantitative terms, the spatial separation of both the spectrum and energy. Our findings represent an example of extreme nonlinear phenomena on subwavelength propagation distances and shed light on the nature of several nonlinear effects recently reported not accounting for the full optical field distribution. Our work also provides new important insights into transparent conducting oxides transient optical properties which are critical for the ongoing research in photonic time crystals, on-chip generation of nonclassical states of light, integrated optical neural networks as well as ultra-fast beam steering and frequency division multiplexing</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important optical component, lens is widely used in scientific inquiry and production. At present, lens manufacturing mainly relies on grinding, polishing and other methods. However, these methods often require expensive equipment and complex processes. This paper presents a method of injecting liquid material into the frame structure and curing it quickly. At the same time, based on the principle of energy minimization, we give a set of theory that can accurately predict the lens face shape, and give the simulation results by software. In this paper, 3D printing technology was used to produce different shapes of borders, which were used to produce free-form surface and spherical lens samples. By characterizing their surface contours and optical properties, the practicability of the method was verified. This method has the advantages of low cost, fast forming, high surface smoothness, and can theoretically prepare any size aperture lens, which has great potential for development.</description>

      <title>Time-correlation Transduction in Strong-field Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in high-power ultrafast optical technology and emerging theoretical frameworks in strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED) are unveiling nuanced differentiations between the semi-classical and full quantum mechanical descriptions of physical systems. Here we present a computational investigation of a novel technique for attosecond optical sensing through time correlation transduction (TCT) by investigating high-harmonic generation (HHG) as a representative SF-QED process. TCT is an experimental method to capture photon-electron interactions at higher harmonic orders by temporarily correlating the emitted and driving photon fields. This approach enables resolving the dynamical behavior of optically-driven strong-field phenomena in quantum materials such as Two-dimensional Materials and Dirac Semimetals down to 10 attosecond temporal resolution to discover a full quantum explanation. Predicting and measuring the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative regimes with attosecond resolution can deepen the understanding of SF-QED such as HHG. As such, we find that TCT is a powerful method to pave the way toward the functional characterization of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Nano-Focusing of Vortex Beams with Hyperbolic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy of judiciously engineered nanostructures and complex topology of light creates unprecedented opportunities for tailoring light-matter interactions on the nanoscale. Electromagnetic waves can carry multiple units of angular momentum per photon, stemming from both spin and orbital angular momentum contributions, offering a potential route for modifying the optical transition selection rules. However, the size difference between a vortex beam and quantum objects limits the interaction strength and the angular momentum exchange. Here, we demonstrate the sub-diffraction-limited focusing of a vortex beam using the high in-plane wave number modes present in hyperbolic metamaterials. The spin-orbit interaction within the hyperbolic structure gives rise to the formation of an optical skyrmion with a deep subwavelength structure, which may enable the exploration of new light-matter interaction phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum erasure based on phase structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum eraser effect exemplifies the distinct properties of quantum mechanics that challenge classical intuition and expose the wave-particle duality of light. This effect has been extensively explored in various experiments; most of these investigations use polarisation to distinguish which path information, and less attention has been paid to the phase structure which is related wavefront of photon. In this study, we introduce a theoretical framework for quantum erasure that focusses on the phase structure and demonstrate it experimentally. In this experiment, we employ a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) where a first-order spiral phase plate (SPP) is integrated into one of its arms. This setup applied orbital angular momentum (OAM) to the photons and established predetermined which-way information. Consequently, the photon demonstrates its particle characteristics, with absence of interference at the MZI's output ports. Utilizing an additional SPP to erase the phase structure from the output photon results in pronounced interference patterns, observable in a post-measurement scenario. This result allows us to include the structure information of the equiphase plane of the light field in quantum erasure. The results challenge the traditional cause-effect relationship in classical physics, given that the subsequent choice of the SPP adheres to a space-like separation.</description>

      <title>Single Exposure Quantitative Phase Imaging with a Conventional Microscope using Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase imaging is gaining importance due to its applications in fields like biomedical imaging and material characterization. In biomedical applications, it can provide quantitative information missing in label-free microscopy modalities. One of the most prominent methods in phase quantification is the Transport-of-Intensity Equation (TIE). TIE often requires multiple acquisitions at different defocus distances, which is not always feasible in a clinical setting. To address this issue, we propose to use chromatic aberrations to induce the required through-focus images with a single exposure, effectively generating a through-focus stack. Since the defocus distance induced by the aberrations is small, conventional TIE solvers are insufficient to address the resulting artifacts. We propose Zero-Mean Diffusion, a modified version of diffusion models designed for quantitative image prediction, and train it with synthetic data to ensure robust phase retrieval. Our contributions offer an alternative TIE approach that leverages chromatic aberrations, achieving accurate single-exposure phase measurement with white light and thus improving the efficiency of phase imaging. Moreover, we present a new class of diffusion models that are well-suited for quantitative data and have a sound theoretical basis. To validate our approach, we employ a widespread brightfield microscope equipped with a commercially available color camera. We apply our model to clinical microscopy of patients' urine, obtaining accurate phase measurements.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Rashba Interactions in a TMDC Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin relaxation dynamics of interlayer excitons in a MoSe2/MoS2 heterostructure induced by the Rashba effect. In such a system, Rashba interactions arise from an out-of-plane electric field due to photo-generated interlayer excitons inducing a phonon-assisted intravalley spin relaxation. We develop a theoretical description based on a microscopic approach to quantify the magnitude of Rashba interactions and test these predictions via time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements. In agreement with the calculations, we find that the Rashba-induced intravalley spin mixing becomes the dominating spin relaxation channel above T = 50 K. Our work identifies a previously unexplored spin-depolarization channel in heterostructures which can be used for ultrafast spin manipulation.</description>

      <title>Efficient backward x-ray emission in a finite-length plasma irradiated by a laser pulse of ps duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments employing ps-long, kilojoule laser pulses, we examined x-ray emission in a finite-length underdense plasma irradiated by such a pulse using two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We found that, in addition to the expected forward emission, the plasma also efficiently emits in the backward direction. Our simulations reveal that the backward emission occurs when the laser exits the plasma. The longitudinal plasma electric field generated by the laser at the density down-ramp turns around some of the laser-accelerated electrons and re-accelerates them in the backward direction. As the electrons collide with the laser, they emit hard x-rays. The energy conversion efficiency is comparable to that for the forward emission, but the effective source size is smaller. We show that the ps laser duration is required for achieving a spatial overlap between the laser and the backward energetic electrons. At peak laser intensity of $1.4\times 10^{20}~\rm{W/cm^2}$, backward emitted photons (energies above 100~keV and $10^{\circ}$ divergence angle) account for $2 \times 10^{-5}$ of the incident laser energy. This conversion efficiency is three times higher than that for similarly selected forward emitted photons. The source size of the backward photons ($5~\rm{\mu m}$) is three times smaller than the source size of the forward photons.</description>

      <title>Considerations for extracting moir\'e-level strain from dark field intensities in transmission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bragg interferometry (BI) is an imaging technique based on four-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (4D-STEM) wherein the intensities of select overlapping Bragg disks are fit or more qualitatively analyzed in the context of simple trigonometric equations to determine local stacking order. In 4D-STEM based approaches, the collection of full diffraction patterns at each real-space position of the scanning probe allows the use of precise virtual apertures much smaller and more variable in shape than those used in conventional dark field imaging, such that even buried interfaces marginally twisted from other layers can be targeted. A coarse-grained form of dark field ptychography, BI uses simple physically derived fitting functions to extract the average structure within the illumination region and is therefore viable over large fields of view. BI has shown a particular advantage for selectively investigating the interlayer stacking and associated moir\'e reconstruction of bilayer interfaces within complex multi-layered structures. This has enabled investigation of reconstruction and substrate effects in bilayers through encapsulating hexagonal boron nitride and of select bilayer interfaces within trilayer stacks. However, the technique can be improved to provide a greater spatial resolution and probe a wider range of twisted structures, for which current limitations on acquisition parameters can lead to large illumination regions and the computationally involved post-processing can fail. Here we analyze these limitations and the computational processing in greater depth, presenting a few methods for improvement over previous works, discussing potential areas for further expansion, and illustrating the current capabilities of this approach for extracting moir\'e-scale strain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based control principle is applicable to entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel correction outperforming direct transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-distance optical quantum channels are necessarily lossy, leading to errors in transmitted quantum information, entanglement degradation and, ultimately, poor protocol performance. Quantum states carrying information in the channel can be probabilistically amplified to compensate for loss, but are destroyed when amplification fails. Quantum correction of the channel itself is therefore required, but break-even performance -- where arbitrary states can be better transmitted through a corrected channel than an uncorrected one -- has so far remained out of reach. Here we perform distillation by heralded amplification to improve a noisy entanglement channel. We subsequently employ entanglement swapping to demonstrate that arbitrary quantum information transmission is unconditionally improved -- i.e. without relying on postselection or post-processing of data -- compared to the uncorrected channel. In this way, it represents realisation of a genuine quantum relay. Our channel correction for single-mode quantum states will find use in quantum repeater, communication and metrology applications.</description>

Abstract: Topological dislocation modes resulting from the interplay between spatial dislocations and momentum-space topology have recently attracted significant interest. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate time-dislocation topological modes which are induced by the interplay between temporal dislocations and Floquet-band topology. By utilizing an extra physical dimension to represent the frequency-space lattice, we implement a two-dimensional Floquet higher-order topological phase and observe time-dislocation induced $\pi$-mode topological corner modes in a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial. Intriguingly, the realized time-dislocation topological modes exhibit spatial localization at the temporal dislocation, despite homogeneous in-plane lattice couplings across it. Our study opens a new avenue to explore the topological phenomena enabled by the interplay between real-space, time-space and momentum-space topology.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Biphoton Spatial Wave Function Dynamics with Quantum Wavefront Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an extremely high dimensionality, the spatial degree of freedom of entangled photons is a key tool for quantum foundation and applied quantum techniques. To fully utilize the feature, the essential task is to experimentally characterize the multiphoton spatial wave function including the entangled amplitude and phase information at different evolutionary stages. However, there is no effective method to measure it. Quantum state tomography is costly, and quantum holography requires additional references. Here we introduce quantum Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing to perform efficient and reference-free measurement of the biphoton spatial wave function. The joint probability distribution of photon pairs at the back focal plane of a microlens array is measured and used for amplitude extraction and phase reconstruction. In the experiment, we observe that the biphoton amplitude correlation becomes weak while phase correlation shows up during free-space propagation. Our work is a crucial step in quantum physical and adaptive optics and paves the way for characterizing quantum optical fields with high-order correlations or topological patterns.</description>

      <title>Ohms law lost and regained: observation and impact of zeros and poles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum conductance and its classical wave analogue, the transmittance, are given by the sum of the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix. The lowest transmission eigenvalue in diffusive media might be expected to play a negligible role in the conductance, and, in any case, to be too small to be observed. Here, we observe the lowest transmission eigenchannel in microwave waveguides, though it is orders of magnitude below the nominal noise level, and show that the transmittance is pulled down by global correlation among transmission eigenvalues and among zeros and poles of the transmission matrix. Transmission vanishes either when the energy density on the sample output vanishes at topological transmission zeros or when the longitudinal velocity vanishes precisely at the crossover to a new channel. This lowers the conductance by an amount proportional to the modulation of the density of states. In accord with the correspondence principle, the conductance approaches Ohms law as the number of channels increases with sample width. The exploration of the transmission matrix opens the door to a new understanding of mesoscopic transport and ultrasensitive detection techniques.</description>

Abstract: Slowing down light in on-chip photonic devices strongly enhances light-matter interaction, but typically also leads to increased backscattering and small-bandwidth operation. It was shown recently that, if one modifies the edge termination of a photonic Chern insulator such that the edge mode wraps many times around the Brillouin zone, light can be slowed to arbitrarily low group velocity over a large bandwidth, without being subject to backscattering. Here we study the robustness of these in-gap slow light modes against fabrication disorder, finding that disorder on scales significantly larger than the minigaps between edge bands is tolerable. We identify the mechanism for wavepacket breakup as disorder-induced velocity renormalization and calculate the associated breakup time.</description>

Abstract: One challenge of using nonlinear optical phenomena for practical applications is the need to perform phase-matching. Recently, epsilon-near-zero materials have been shown to demonstrate strong optical nonlinearities, in addition to their other unique properties. As suggested by their name, the permittivity of the material is close to zero for a certain wavelength range. We demonstrate that this small permittivity allows for efficient three-wave mixing interactions to take place in indium-tin-oxide thin films without the need for phase matching the pump and signal beams. The efficiency of the second-order nonlinear interactions is characterized, and cascaded three-wave mixing is demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: Access to eye care can be expanded with high-throughput, easy-to-use, and portable diagnostic tools. Phase mask encoded imaging could improve these aspects of the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing without any moving parts. This approach circumvents the need to adjust lenses to compensate for refractive errors. We developed a computational fundus camera by introducing a holographic diffuser at the plane conjugate to the ocular pupil, resulting in a laterally shift-invariant point spread function. We demonstrate computational refocusing of a model eye fundus over a large range of defocus errors. We also show computationally refocused, color, in vivo, human fundus images with a $\geq$35-degree field-of-view (FOV). This technology could eventually be combined with the wavefront-sensing capabilities of phase mask encoded imaging to create a compact ophthalmic imaging system that simultaneously captures a fundus image and performs aberrometry.</description>

Abstract: Edholm's Law predicts exponential growth in data rate and spectrum bandwidth for communications and is forecasted to remain true for the upcoming deployment of 6G. Compounding this issue is the exponentially increasing demand for deep neural network (DNN) compute, including DNNs for signal processing. However, the slowing of Moore's Law due to the limitations of transistor-based electronics means that completely new paradigms for computing will be required to meet these increasing demands for advanced communications. Optical neural networks (ONNs) are promising DNN accelerators with ultra-low latency and energy consumption. Yet state-of-the-art ONNs struggle with scalability and implementing linear with in-line nonlinear operations. Here we introduce our multiplicative analog frequency transform ONN (MAFT-ONN) that encodes the data in the frequency domain, achieves matrix-vector products in a single shot using photoelectric multiplication, and uses a single electro-optic modulator for the nonlinear activation of all neurons in each layer. We experimentally demonstrate the first hardware accelerator that computes fully-analog deep learning on raw RF signals, performing single-shot modulation classification with 85% accuracy, where a 'majority vote' multi-measurement scheme can boost the accuracy to 95% within 5 consecutive measurements. In addition, we demonstrate frequency-domain finite impulse response (FIR) linear-time-invariant (LTI) operations, enabling a powerful combination of traditional and AI signal processing. We also demonstrate the scalability of our architecture by computing nearly 4 million fully-analog multiplies-and-accumulates for MNIST digit classification. Our latency estimation model shows that due to the Shannon capacity-limited analog data movement, MAFT-ONN is hundreds of times faster than traditional RF receivers operating at their theoretical peak performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absolute angular rotation rate measurements with sensitivity better than prad/s would be beneficial for fundamental science investigations. On this regard, large frame Earth based ring laser gyroscopes are top instrumentation as far as bandwidth, long--term operation, and sensitivity are concerned. Here, we demonstrate that the GINGERINO active--ring laser upper limiting noise is close to $2 \times 10^{-15}$ rad/s for $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ s of integration time, as estimated by the Allan deviation evaluated in a differential measurement scheme. This is more than a factor 10 better than the theoretical prediction so far accounted for ideal ring lasers shot--noise with the two beams counter--propagating inside the cavity considered as two independent propagating modes. This feature is related to the peculiarity of real ring laser system dynamics that causes phase cross--talking among the two counter--propagating modes. In this context, the independent beam model is, then, not applicable and the measured noise limit falls below the expected one.</description>

Abstract: Interferometers and beam splitters are fundamental building blocks for photonic neuromorphic and quantum computing machinery. In waveguide-based photonic integrated circuits, beam-splitting is achieved with directional couplers that rely on transition regions where the waveguides are adiabatically bent to suppress back-reflection. We present a novel, compact approach to introducing guided mode coupling. By leveraging multimodal domain walls between microwave topological photonic crystals, we use the photonic-spin-conservation to suppress back-reflection while relaxing the topological protection of the valley degree of freedom to implement tunable beam splitting. Rapid advancements in chip-scale topological photonics suggest that the proposed simultaneous utilization of multiple topological degrees of freedom could benefit the development of novel photonic computing platforms.</description>
