      <title>What If: Causal Analysis with Graph Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are expressive abstractions representing more effectively relationships in data and enabling data science tasks. They are also a widely adopted paradigm in causal inference focusing on causal directed acyclic graphs. Causal DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) are manually curated by domain experts, but they are never validated, stored and integrated as data artifacts in a graph data management system. In this paper, we delineate our vision to align these two paradigms, namely causal analysis and property graphs, the latter being the cornerstone of modern graph databases. To articulate this vision, a paradigm shift is required leading to rethinking property graph data models with hypernodes and structural equations, graph query semantics and query constructs, and the definition of graph views to account for causality operators. Moreover, several research problems and challenges arise aiming at automatically extracting causal models from the underlying graph observational data, aligning and integrating disparate causal graph models into unified ones along with their maintenance upon the changes in the underlying data. The above vision will allow to make graph databases aware of causal knowledge and pave the way to data-driven personalized decision-making in several scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Cross-table Synthetic Tabular Data Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic tabular data is essential to prevent the distribution of false or manipulated datasets that could compromise data-driven decision-making. This study explores whether synthetic tabular data can be reliably identified ''in the wild''-meaning across different generators, domains, and table formats. This challenge is unique to tabular data, where structures (such as number of columns, data types, and formats) can vary widely from one table to another. We propose three cross-table baseline detectors and four distinct evaluation protocols, each corresponding to a different level of ''wildness''. Our very preliminary results confirm that cross-table adaptation is a challenging task.</description>

      <title>On Enhancing Root Cause Analysis with SQL Summaries for Failures in Database Workload Replays at SAP HANA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing the workload of a database and replaying this workload for a new version of the database can be an effective approach for regression testing. However, false positive errors caused by many factors such as data privacy limitations, time dependency or non-determinism in multi-threaded environment can negatively impact the effectiveness. Therefore, we employ a machine learning based framework to automate the root cause analysis of failures found during replays. However, handling unseen novel issues not found in the training data is one general challenge of machine learning approaches with respect to generalizability of the learned model. We describe how we continue to address this challenge for more robust long-term solutions. From our experience, retraining with new failures is inadequate due to features overlapping across distinct root causes. Hence, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to analyze failed SQL statements and extract concise failure summaries as an additional feature to enhance the classification process. Our experiments show the F1-Macro score improved by 4.77% for our data. We consider our approach beneficial for providing end users with additional information to gain more insights into the found issues and to improve the assessment of the replay results.</description>

      <title>Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics (ARTEMIS-DA), a novel framework designed to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex, multi-step data analytics tasks. ARTEMIS-DA integrates three core components: the Planner, which dissects complex user queries into structured, sequential instructions encompassing data preprocessing, transformation, predictive modeling, and visualization; the Coder, which dynamically generates and executes Python code to implement these instructions; and the Grapher, which interprets generated visualizations to derive actionable insights. By orchestrating the collaboration between these components, ARTEMIS-DA effectively manages sophisticated analytical workflows involving advanced reasoning, multi-step transformations, and synthesis across diverse data modalities. The framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact, demonstrating its ability to tackle intricate analytical tasks with precision and adaptability. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with automated code generation and execution and visual analysis, ARTEMIS-DA offers a robust, scalable solution for multi-step insight synthesis, addressing a wide range of challenges in data analytics.</description>

      <title>Privately Answering Queries on Skewed Data via Per Record Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the private release of statistics (like aggregate payrolls) where it is critical to preserve the contribution made by a small number of outlying large entities. We propose a privacy formalism, per-record zero concentrated differential privacy (PzCDP), where the privacy loss associated with each record is a public function of that record's value. Unlike other formalisms which provide different privacy losses to different records, PRzCDP's privacy loss depends explicitly on the confidential data. We define our formalism, derive its properties, and propose mechanisms which satisfy PRzCDP that are uniquely suited to publishing skewed or heavy-tailed statistics, where a small number of records contribute substantially to query answers. This targeted relaxation helps overcome the difficulties of applying standard DP to these data products.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Sketches for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketch algorithms only allow to give very rough estimates with limited memory cost, whereas some learning-augmented algorithms have been proposed recently, their offline framework requires actual frequencies that are challenging to access in general for training, and speed is too slow for real-time processing, despite the still coarse-grained accuracy.
  To this end, we propose a more practical learning-based estimation framework namely UCL-sketch, by following the line of equation-based sketch to estimate per-key frequencies. In a nutshell, there are two key techniques: online training via equivalent learning without ground truth, and highly scalable architecture with logical estimation buckets. We implemented experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art sketches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution, while preserving resource efficiency. Our code is attached in the supplementary material, and will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch.</description>
