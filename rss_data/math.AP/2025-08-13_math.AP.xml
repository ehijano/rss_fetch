      <title>Eigenvalue falls in thin broken quantum strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interesting in the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian in thin broken strips with angle $\alpha$. Playing with symmetries, this leads us to investigate spectral problems for the Laplace operator with mixed boundary conditions in thin trapezoids characterized by a parameter $\varepsilon$ small. We give an asymptotic expansion of the first eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. The new point in this work is to study the dependence with respect to $\alpha$. We show that for a small fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, at certain particular angles $\alpha^\star_k$, $k=0,1,\dots$, that we characterize, an eigenvalue dives, i.e. moves down rapidly, below the normalized threshold $\pi^2/\varepsilon^2$ as $\alpha&gt;0$ increases. We describe the way the eigenvalue dives below $\pi^2/\varepsilon^2$ and prove that the phenomenon is milder at $\alpha^\star_0=0$ than at $\alpha^\star_k$ for $k\ge1$.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit from kinetic models with massless electrons to the ionic Euler--Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the derivation of ion dynamics, namely, the ionic Euler--Poisson system, from kinetic descriptions. The kinetic framework consists of the ionic Vlasov--Poisson equation coupled with either a nonlinear Fokker--Planck operator or a local alignment term. In both kinetic and fluid models, the massless electrons are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, leading to an electric potential governed by the Poisson--Boltzmann equation. The exponential nonlinearity in this semilinear elliptic problem creates significant mathematical difficulties, which we overcome by exploiting the physical structure of the system, in particular, the role of the electron velocity field hidden in the limiting equation. Our first main result establishes the hydrodynamic limit from the kinetic model to the ionic Euler--Poisson system, providing quantitative error estimates via the modulated energy method. As a second contribution, we prove the global-in-time existence of weak entropy solutions to the kinetic equations, ensuring consistency with the hydrodynamic limit framework.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability of critical points for the nonlocal-Sobolev inequality in Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantitative stability of the nonlocal Sobolev inequality in Heisenberg group \begin{equation*}\label{non-Sobolev}
  C_{HL}(Q,\mu) \left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\xi)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}|u(\eta)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\eta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}\mathrm{d}\xi\mathrm{d}\eta\right)^{\frac{1}{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}\leq \int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}|\nabla_{H}u|^{2}d\xi,\qquad\forall u\in S^{1,2}(\mathbb{H}^{n}), \end{equation*} where $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of the Hiesenberg group $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $\mu\in(0,Q)$ and $Q^{\ast}_{\mu}=\frac{2Q-\mu}{Q-2}$ are two parameters corresponding to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and Folland-Stein inequality on Heisenberg group, $C_{HL}(Q,\mu)$ is the sharp constant of the nonlocal-Sobolev inequality. Specifically, when $u$ is close to solving the Euler equation \begin{equation*}\label{non-critical-n}
  -\Delta_{H} u=\left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\eta)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\eta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}\mathrm{d}\eta\right)|u|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}-2}u,\qquad\xi,\eta\in\mathbb{H}^{n}, \end{equation*} the natural distance between $u$ and the the set of optimizers $U_{\lambda,\zeta}$, defined as $\delta(u)=||\nabla_{H}u-\nabla_{H}U_{\lambda,\zeta}||_{L^{2}}$, can be linearly bounded by the functional derivative term \begin{equation*}
  \Gamma(u)=\left\|\Delta_{H}u+\left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\eta)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\eta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}\mathrm{d}\eta\right)|u|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}-2}u\right\|_{(S^{1,2}(\mathbb{H}^{n}))^{-1}}.
  \end{equation*} And for the weakly interacting bubble solutions $\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i=1}^{\nu}U_{\lambda_{i},\zeta_{i}}$, the aforementioned quantitative stability result holds when the dimension $Q=4$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of reaction-diffusion wave trains under large and fully nonlocalized modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of periodic wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems on the real line under large, fully nonlocalized modulations. We prove that solutions with nearby initial data converge, at an enhanced diffusive rate, to a modulated wave train whose leading-order phase and wavenumber dynamics are governed by an explicit solution to the viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This constitutes a global stability result: such initial data are generally not close to the large-time modulated wave train. In contrast to previous modulational stability results, our analysis does not require that the initial data approach phase shifts of the wave train at spatial infinity. The central methodological advance is a nontrivial extension of the recently developed $L^\infty$-stability theory to accommodate large phase modulations. This framework, based entirely on $L^\infty$-estimates, removes all localization requirements as imposed in the previous literature, allowing us to treat the full range of bounded modulational initial data under minimal regularity assumptions. The main technical contributions include: the strategic use of interpolation inequalities to balance smallness and temporal decay, and a detailed analysis of the linear dynamics under fully nonlocalized modulational data.</description>

      <title>Global solution and asymptotic behavior for the kinetic derivative NLS on $\mathbb R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the global well-posedness and long-term behavior of solutions to the kinetic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (KDNLS) on the real line. The equation incorporates both local cubic nonlinearities with derivative terms and a non-local term arising from the Hilbert transform, modeling interactions in plasma physics. We establish global existence for small initial data in the weighted Sobolev space $H^2 \cap H^{1,1}$ and optimal time decay effect. Using energy methods and a frequency-localized gauge transformation, we overcome the difficulties posed by the non-local nonlinearities and provide a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic behavior. Our results also describe modified scattering phenomena with a suitable phase modification, showing that the solutions exhibit a precise asymptotic profile as $t \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Splash in Free Boundary Problem of 3D Neo-Hookean Elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes finite-time splash singularity formation for 3D viscous incompressible neo-Hookean elastodynamics with free boundaries. The system features mixed stress-kinematic conditions where viscous-elastic stresses balance pressure forces at the evolving interface -- a configuration generating complex boundary integrals that distinguish it from Navier-Stokes or MHD systems. To address this challenge, we employ a Lagrangian framework inspired by Coutand and Shkoller (2019), developing specialized coordinate charts and constructing a sequence of shrinking initial domains with cylindrical necks connecting hemispherical regions to bases. Divergence-free initial velocity and deformation tensor fields are designed to satisfy exact mechanical compatibility. Uniform a priori estimates across the domain sequence demonstrate that interface evolution preserves local smoothness while developing finite-time self-intersection. Energy conservation provides foundational stability, while higher-order energy functionals yield scaling-invariant regularity control. The analysis proves inevitable splash singularity formation within explicitly bounded time, maintaining spatial smoothness near the singular point up to the intersection time.</description>

      <title>Improved existence time for Whitham and a Whitham-Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time of existence of the solutions to two full dispersion models derived from the water waves equations in the shallow water regime: the Whitham equation and a Whitham-Boussinesq system in dimension one and two. The regime is characterized by the nonlinearity parameter $\epsilon\in(0,1]$ and the shallow water parameter $\mu\in(0,1]$.
  We extend the lifespan of the solution beyond the hyperbolic time $\epsilon^{-1}$. More precisely, we establish well-posedness on the timescale of order $\mu^{\frac{1}{4}^-}\epsilon^{(-\frac{5}{4})^+}$ in the one-dimensional case, and of order $\mu^{\frac{1}{4}^-}\epsilon^{(-\frac{3}{2})^+}$ in dimension two. We emphasize that for the two-dimensional case, we obtain a time of existence of order $\epsilon^{-\frac54}$ in the long wave regime $\mu \sim \epsilon$. This kind of result seems to be new, even for the Boussinesq systems.
  The proofs combine energy methods with Strichartz estimates. Here, a key ingredient is to obtain new refined Strichartz estimates that include the small parameter $\mu$. These techniques are robust and could be adapted to improve the lifespan of solutions for other equations and systems of the same form.</description>

      <title>Generalized quasi-linear fractional Wentzell problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded $(\epsilon,\delta)$-domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R\!}^N$ ($N\geq2$) whose boundary $\Gamma:=\partial\Omega$ is a $d$-set for $d\in(N-p,N)$, we investigate a generalized quasi-linear elliptic boundary value problem governed by the regional fractional $p$-Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s_{_{p,\Omega}}$ in $\Omega$, and generalized fractional Wentzell boundary conditions of type $$C'_{p,s}\mathcal{N}^{p'(1-s)}u+\beta|u|^{q-2} u+\Theta^{\eta}_qu\,=\,g\indent\indent\indent\textrm{on}\,\,\Gamma,$$ where $\Theta^{\eta}_q$ stands as a nonlocal fractional-type $q$-operator on $\Gamma$ (also refered as a Besov $q$-map), $C'_{p,s}\mathcal{N}^{p'(1-s)}$ denotes the fractional $p$-normal derivative operator in $\Gamma$, and $p,\,q$ are two growth exponents acting on the interior and boundary, respectively (which are in general unrelated between each other). We first show that this model equation admits a unique weak solution, which is globally bounded in $\overline{\Omega}$. Furthermore, given two distinct weak solution related to this boundary value problem with different data values, we establish a priori $L^{\infty}$-estimates for the difference of weak solutions with upper bound depending in the differences of the respective interior and boundary data functions. Additionally, a Weak Comparison Principle is derived, and we conclude by establishing a sort of nonlinear Fredholm Alternative related to this generalized elliptic fractional model equation.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Reissner-Mindlin model from nonlinear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how the Reissner-Mindlin plate model can be derived from three-dimensional finite elasticity in terms of $\Gamma$-convergence. The presence of transverse shear effects in the Reissner-Mindlin model requires to scale different components of the three-dimensional elastic strain differently. A main technical tool is then the combination of rigidity estimates for the deformation and suitably averaged versions.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity in half-spaces for singular quasilinear elliptic problems involving the gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positive solutions to the problem $-\Delta_p u + \vartheta |\nabla u|^q = \frac{1}{u^\gamma} + f(u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N_+$ with the zero Dirichlet boundary condition, where $p&gt;1$, $\gamma&gt;0$, $0&lt;q\le p$, $\vartheta\ge0$ and $f:[0,+\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$ is a locally Lipschitz continuous function. We describe the behavior of solutions and their derivatives near the boundary. Then we exploit that information and the moving plane method to prove the monotonicity of solutions in the $x_N$-direction. This result holds for $W^{1,p}_{\rm loc}(\mathbb{R}^2_+)\cap L^\infty_{\rm loc}(\overline{\mathbb{R}^2_+})$ solutions in dimension two and for $W^{1,p}_{\rm loc}(\mathbb{R}^N_+)$ solutions which are bounded in strips in higher dimensions. Most of our results are new even in the case $\vartheta=0$ or $p=2$.</description>

      <title>A Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu result for fractional thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the limit of squared $H^s$-Gagliardo seminorms on thin domains of the form $\Omega_\varepsilon=\omega\times(0,\varepsilon)$ in $\mathbb R^d$. When $\varepsilon$ is fixed, multiplying by $1-s$ such seminorms have been proved to converge as $s\to 1^-$ to a dimensional constant $c_d$ times the Dirichlet integral on $\Omega_\varepsilon$ by Bourgain, Brezis and Mironescu. In its turn such Dirichlet integrals divided by $\varepsilon$ converge as $\varepsilon\to 0$ to a dimensionally reduced Dirichlet integral on $\omega$. We prove that if we let simultaneously $\varepsilon\to 0$ and $s\to 1$ then these squared seminorms still converge to the same dimensionally reduced limit when multiplied by $(1-s) \varepsilon^{2s-3}$, independently of the relative converge speed of $s$ and $\varepsilon$. This coefficient combines the geometrical scaling $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and the fact that relevant interactions for the $H^s$-Gagliardo seminorms are those at scale $\varepsilon$. We also study the usual membrane scaling, obtained by multiplying by $(1-s)\varepsilon^{-1}$, which highlighs the {\em critical scaling} $1-s\sim|\log\varepsilon|^{-1}$, and the limit when $\varepsilon\to 0$ at fixed $s$.</description>

      <title>Weighted, Multiphase, Volume-Preserving Mean Curvature Flow as Limit of the MBO Scheme on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous thresholding scheme by Merriman, Bence, and Osher (Motion of multiple junctions: A level set approach. Journal of Computational Physics 112.2 (1994): 334-363.) proved itself as a very efficient time discretization of mean curvature flow. The present paper studies a multiphase, volume constrained version on a weighted manifold that naturally arises in the context of data science. The main result of this work proves convergence to multiphase, weighted, volume-preserving mean curvature flow on a smooth, closed manifold. The proof is only conditional in the sense that convergence of the approximating energy to the weighted perimeter is assumed. These type of assumptions are natural and common in the literature. The proof shows convergence in the energy dissipation inequality, induced by the underlying gradient flow structure, similar to the work of Laux and Otto (The thresholding scheme for mean curvature flow and De Giorgi's ideas for minimizing movements. The Role of Metrics in the Theory of Partial Differential Equations 85 (2020): 63-94.). This leads to a new De Giorgi solution concept that describes weakly the limiting flow. Estimates regarding the derivatives of the heat kernel are developed in order to pass to the limit in the variations of the energy and metric.</description>

      <title>Sharp phase transition in the grand canonical $\Phi^3$ measure at critical chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transition and critical phenomenon for the grand canonical $\Phi^3$ measure in two-dimensional Euclidean quantum field theory. The study of this measure was initiated by Jaffe, Bourgain, and Carlen--Fr\"ohlich--Lebowitz, primarily in regimes far from criticality. We identify a critical chemical potential and show that the measure exhibits a sharp phase transition at this critical threshold. At the critical threshold, the analysis is based on establishing the correlation decay of the Gaussian fluctuations in the partition function, combined with a coarse-graining argument to show divergence of the maximum of an approximating Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Vanishing Campanato Spaces via Ball Banach Function Spaces and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the authors provide some new characterizations of several vanishing Campanato spaces using a type of oscillation defined within the general framework of ball Banach function spaces. This approach yields fresh insights even in the special case of the vanishing BMO space. The characterization reveals a self-improvement phenomenon inherent in vanishing Campanato spaces. A key innovation of this approach lies in using higher-order differences to dominate oscillations. Instead of directly estimating these differences, the authors achieve the domination by smoothing the function via convolution. As additional outcomes, the authors also obtain new characterizations of vanishing Campanato spaces in terms of higher-order differences. Finally, the authors present several examples to show that these vanishing Campanato spaces naturally arise in the study on the compactness of fractional integral commutators in Morrey spaces.</description>

      <title>Stability of spinorial Sobolev inequalities on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spinorial Sobolev inequality on the unit sphere states \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq 0, \end{equation*} with equality if and only if $\psi \in {\mathcal M}$, the set of all $-\frac 12$-Killing spinors and their conformal transformations.
  Our main result in this paper is to refine this inequality by establishing a stability inequality
  \begin{equation*} \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}-\frac{n}{2}\omega_{n}^{1/n}\int\langle D\psi,\psi\rangle
  \geq {\bf c}_S\inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{M}}\Big(\int| D(\psi-\phi)|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}}.
  \end{equation*}
  As a by-product of our argument, we show that elements in set $\mathcal M$ are not optimizers of another spinorial Sobolev inequality
  \begin{equation*}
  \Big(\int| D\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n+1}}\Big)^{\frac{n+1}{n}} \geq C_S \Big(\int|\psi|^{\frac{2n}{n-1}}\Big)^{\frac{n-1}{n}},
  \end{equation*}
  unlike expected by experts. They have in fact index $n+1$ and nullity $2^{[\frac n2]+2}$.</description>

      <title>Regularity of vector fields with piecewise regular curl and divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ with sufficiently smooth boundary and prove piecewise Sobolev regularity of vector fields that have piecewise regular curl and divergence, but may be discontinuous across mutually disjoint and sufficiently smooth surfaces inside of $\Omega$. The main idea behind our approach is to employ recently developed parametrices for the curl-operator and the regularity theory of Poisson transmission problems. We conclude our work by applying our findings to the heterogeneous time-harmonic Maxwell equations with either a) impedance, b) natural or c) essential boundary conditions and providing wavenumber-explicit piecewise regularity estimates for these equations.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>A nonvariational form of the acoustic single layer potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a bounded open subset $\Omega$ of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in]0,1[$ and the space $V^{-1,\alpha}(\partial\Omega)$ of (distributional) normal derivatives on the boundary of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions in $\Omega$ that have Laplace operator in the Schauder space with negative exponent $C^{-1,\alpha}(\overline{\Omega})$. Then we prove those properties of the acoustic single layer potential that are necessary to analyze the Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation in $\Omega$ with boundary data in $V^{-1,\alpha}(\partial\Omega)$ and solutions in the space of $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous functions in $\Omega$ that have Laplace operator in $C^{-1,\alpha}(\overline{\Omega})$, \textit{i.e.}, in a space of functions that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. Namely, a Neumann problem that does not belong to the classical variational setting.</description>

      <title>Blow-up solutions of parabolic $p$-Laplacian inequalities on locally finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study blow up behavior of the semilinear parabolic inequality with $p$-Laplacian operator and nonlinear source $u_t - \Delta_p u \geq \sigma(x, t)\Phi(u)$ on a locally finite connected weighted graph $G = (V, E)$. We extend the comparison principle and thereby establish the relationship between the initial value and the existence of blow-up solutions to the problem under different growth rates of $\Phi$. We prove that when the growth rate of $\Phi$ exceeds linear growth, blow-up solutions exist under appropriate initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Pohozaev-like identity for the regional fractional laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new integration by parts formula for the regional fractional laplacian $(-\Delta)^s_\Omega$ in bounded open sets of class $C^2$. As a direct application, we prove that weak solutions to the corresponding Dirichlet problem satisfy a Pohozaev-like identity with an explicit remainder term. We apply the later to eigenvalue problems in the unit ball and discuss its potential use in establishing boundary-type unique continuation properties.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral outside a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field generated outside a spherical surface using surface data on the sphere. The method employs Lebedev quadratures, which are optimal integration on the sphere, and Lagrange interpolation and differentiation in an advanced time algorithm for the evaluation of the transient field. Numerical testing demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes, making the method an efficient means of evaluating the field generated by a large number of sources.</description>
