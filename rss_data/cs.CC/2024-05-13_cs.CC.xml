      <title>A Pair of Bayesian Network Structures has Undecidable Conditional Independencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Bayesian network structure (directed acyclic graph), the celebrated d-separation algorithm efficiently determines whether the network structure implies a given conditional independence relation. We show that this changes drastically when we consider two Bayesian network structures instead. It is undecidable to determine whether two given network structures imply a given conditional independency, that is, whether every collection of random variables satisfying both network structures must also satisfy the conditional independency. Although the approximate combination of two Bayesian networks is a well-studied topic, our result shows that it is fundamentally impossible to accurately combine the knowledge of two Bayesian network structures, in the sense that no algorithm can tell what conditional independencies are implied by the two network structures. We can also explicitly construct two Bayesian network structures, such that whether they imply a certain conditional independency is unprovable in the ZFC set theory, assuming ZFC is consistent.</description>

      <title>PCF Learned Sort: a Learning Augmented Sort Algorithm with $O(n \log\log n)$ Expected Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorting is one of the most fundamental algorithms in computer science. Recently, Learned Sorts, which use machine learning to improve sorting speed, have attracted attention. While existing studies show that Learned Sort is experimentally faster than classical sorting algorithms, they do not provide theoretical guarantees about its computational complexity. We propose PCF Learned Sort, a theoretically guaranteed Learned Sort algorithm. We prove that the expected complexity of PCF Learned Sort is $O(n \log \log n)$ under mild assumptions on the data distribution. We also confirm experimentally that PCF Learned Sort has a computational complexity of $O(n \log \log n)$ on both synthetic and real datasets. This is the first study to theoretically support the experimental success of Learned Sort, and provides evidence for why Learned Sort is fast.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separation between Noisy Quantum Polynomial Time and the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the oracle separation between the physically motivated complexity class of noisy quantum circuits, inspired by definitions such as those presented by Chen, Cotler, Huang, and Li (2022). We establish that with a constant error rate, separation can be achieved in terms of NP. When the error rate is $\Omega(\log n/n)$, we can extend this result to the separation of PH. Notably, our oracles, in all separations, do not necessitate error correction schemes or fault tolerance, as all quantum circuits are of constant depth. This indicates that even quantum computers with minor errors, without error correction, may surpass classical complexity classes under various scenarios and assumptions. We also explore various common noise settings and present new classical hardness results, generalizing those found in studies by Raz and Tal (2022) and Bassirian, Bouland, Fefferman, Gunn, and Tal (2021), which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Rank-Ramsey Problem and the Log-Rank Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is called Rank-Ramsey if (i) Its clique number is small, and (ii) The adjacency matrix of its complement has small rank. We initiate a systematic study of such graphs. Our main motivation is that their constructions, as well as proofs of their non-existence, are intimately related to the famous log-rank conjecture from the field of communication complexity. These investigations also open interesting new avenues in Ramsey theory.
  We construct two families of Rank-Ramsey graphs exhibiting polynomial separation between order and complement rank. Graphs in the first family have bounded clique number (as low as $41$). These are subgraphs of certain strong products, whose building blocks are derived from triangle-free strongly-regular graphs. Graphs in the second family are obtained by applying Boolean functions to Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Their clique number is logarithmic, but their complement rank is far smaller than in the first family, about $\mathcal{O}(n^{2/3})$. A key component of this construction is our matrix-theoretic view of lifts.
  We also consider lower bounds on the Rank-Ramsey numbers, and determine them in the range where the complement rank is $5$ or less. We consider connections between said numbers and other graph parameters, and find that the two best known explicit constructions of triangle-free Ramsey graphs turn out to be far from Rank-Ramsey.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic and Causal Satisfiability: the Impact of Marginalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) formalizes three types of reasoning: observational, interventional, and counterfactual, that reflect the progressive sophistication of human thought regarding causation. We investigate the computational complexity aspects of reasoning in this framework focusing mainly on satisfiability problems expressed in probabilistic and causal languages across the PCH. That is, given a system of formulas in the standard probabilistic and causal languages, does there exist a model satisfying the formulas? The resulting complexity changes depending on the level of the hierarchy as well as the operators allowed in the formulas (addition, multiplication, or marginalization).
  We focus on formulas involving marginalization that are widely used in probabilistic and causal inference, but whose complexity issues are still little explored. Our main contribution are the exact computational complexity results showing that linear languages (allowing addition and marginalization) yield NP^PP-, PSPACE-, and NEXP-complete satisfiability problems, depending on the level of the PCH. Moreover, we prove that the problem for the full language (allowing additionally multiplication) is complete for the class succ$\exists$R for languages on the highest, counterfactual level. Previous work has shown that the satisfiability problem is complete for succ$\exists$R on the lower levels leaving the counterfactual case open. Finally, we consider constrained models that are restricted to a small polynomial size. The constraint on the size reduces the complexity of the interventional and counterfactual languages to NEXP-complete.</description>

Abstract: We investigate logics and classes of problems below Fagin's existential second-order logic (ESO) and above Feder and Vardi's logic for constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), the so called monotone monadic SNP without inequality (MMSNP). It is known that MMSNP has a dichotomy between P and NP-complete but the removal of any of these three restrictions imposed on SNP yields a logic that is Ptime equivalent to ESO: so by Ladner's theorem we have three stronger sibling logics that are nondichotomic above MMSNP. In this paper, we explore the area between these four logics, mostly by considering guarded extensions of MMSNP, with the ultimate goal being to obtain logics above MMSNP that exhibit such a dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Problems in NP can Admit Double-Exponential Lower Bounds when Parameterized by Treewidth or Vertex Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08149v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treewidth (tw) is an important parameter that, when bounded, yields tractability for many problems. For example, graph problems expressible in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic and QUANTIFIED SAT or, more generally, QUANTIFIED CSP, are FPT parameterized by the tw of the input's (primal) graph plus the length of the MSO-formula [Courcelle, Information &amp; Computation 1990] and the quantifier rank [Chen, ECAI 2004], resp. The algorithms from these (meta-)results have running times whose dependence on tw is a tower of exponents. A conditional lower bound by Fichte et al. [LICS 2020] shows that, for QUANTIFIED SAT, the height of this tower is equal to the number of quantifier alternations. Lower bounds showing that at least double-exponential factors in the running time are necessary are rare: there are very few (for tw and vertex cover vc parameterizations) and they are for problems that are complete for #NP, $\Sigma_2^p$, $\Pi_2^p$, or higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.
  We show, for the first time, that it is not necessary to go higher up in the polynomial hierarchy to obtain such lower bounds. We design a novel, yet simple versatile technique based on Sperner families to obtain such lower bounds and apply it to 3 problems: METRIC DIMENSION, STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, and GEODETIC SET. We prove that they do not admit $2^{2^{o(tw)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms, even on bounded diameter graphs, unless the ETH fails. For STRONG METRIC DIMENSION, the lower bound holds even for vc. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds.</description>

      <title>On Good $2$-Query Locally Testable Codes from Sheaves on High Dimensional Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expose a strong connection between good $2$-query locally testable codes (LTCs) and high dimensional expanders. Here, an LTC is called good if it has constant rate and linear distance. Our emphasis in this work is on LTCs testable with only $2$ queries, which are of particular interest to theoretical computer science. This is done by introducing a new object called a sheaf that is put on top of a high dimensional expander. Sheaves are vastly studied in topology. Here, we introduce sheaves on simplicial complexes. Moreover, we define a notion of an expanding sheaf that has not been studied before.
  We present a framework to get good infinite families of $2$-query LTCs from expanding sheaves on high dimensional expanders, utilizing towers of coverings of these high dimensional expanders. Starting with a high dimensional expander and an expanding sheaf, our framework produces an infinite family of codes admitting a $2$-query tester. We show that if the initial sheaved high dimensional expander satisfies some conditions, which can be checked in constant time, then these codes form a family of good $2$-query LTCs.
  We give candidates for sheaved high dimensional expanders which can be fed into our framework, in the form of an iterative process which conjecturally produces such candidates given a high dimensional expander and a special auxiliary sheaf. (We could not verify the prerequisites of our framework for these candidates directly because of computational limitations.) We analyse this process experimentally and heuristically, and identify some properties of the fundamental group of the high dimensional expander at hand which are sufficient (but not necessary) to get the desired sheaf, and consequently an infinite family of good $2$-query LTCs.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Distance-$d$ Independent Set Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07199v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed positive integer $d \geq 2$, a distance-$d$ independent set (D$d$IS) of a graph is a vertex subset whose distance between any two members is at least $d$. Imagine that there is a token placed on each member of a D$d$IS. Two D$d$ISs are adjacent under Token Sliding ($\mathsf{TS}$) if one can be obtained from the other by moving a token from one vertex to one of its unoccupied adjacent vertices. Under Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$), the target vertex needs not to be adjacent to the original one. The Distance-$d$ Independent Set Reconfiguration (D$d$ISR) problem under $\mathsf{TS}/\mathsf{TJ}$ asks if there is a corresponding sequence of adjacent D$d$ISs that transforms one given D$d$IS into another. The problem for $d = 2$, also known as the Independent Set Reconfiguration problem, has been well-studied in the literature and its computational complexity on several graph classes has been known. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of D$d$ISR on different graphs under $\mathsf{TS}$ and $\mathsf{TJ}$ for any fixed $d \geq 3$. On chordal graphs, we show that D$d$ISR under $\mathsf{TJ}$ is in $\mathtt{P}$ when $d$ is even and $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete when $d$ is odd. On split graphs, there is an interesting complexity dichotomy: D$d$ISR is $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $d = 2$ but in $\mathtt{P}$ for $d=3$ under $\mathsf{TS}$, while under $\mathsf{TJ}$ it is in $\mathtt{P}$ for $d = 2$ but $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete for $d = 3$. Additionally, certain well-known hardness results for $d = 2$ on perfect graphs and planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth can be extended for $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Good Codes Approaching Distance 1 in Ulam Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ulam distance of two permutations on $[n]$ is $n$ minus the length of their longest common subsequence. In this paper, we show that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists some $\alpha&gt;0$, and an infinite set $\Gamma\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, such that for all $n\in\Gamma$, there is an explicit set $C_n$ of $(n!)^{\alpha}$ many permutations on $[n]$, such that every pair of permutations in $C_n$ has pairwise Ulam distance at least $(1-\varepsilon)\cdot n$. Moreover, we can compute the $i^{\text{th}}$ permutation in $C_n$ in poly$(n)$ time and can also decode in poly$(n)$ time, a permutation $\pi$ on $[n]$ to its closest permutation $\pi^*$ in $C_n$, if the Ulam distance of $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ is less than $ \frac{(1-\varepsilon)\cdot n}{4} $.
  Previously, it was implicitly known by combining works of Goldreich and Wigderson [Israel Journal of Mathematics'23] and Farnoud, Skachek, and Milenkovic [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'13] in a black-box manner, that it is possible to explicitly construct $(n!)^{\Omega(1)}$ many permutations on $[n]$, such that every pair of them have pairwise Ulam distance at least $\frac{n}{6}\cdot (1-\varepsilon)$, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and the bound on the distance can be improved to $\frac{n}{4}\cdot (1-\varepsilon)$ if the construction of Goldreich and Wigderson is directly analyzed in the Ulam metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Annealers are basically quantum computers that with high probability can optimize certain quadratic functions on Boolean variables in constant time. These functions are basically the Hamiltonian of Ising models that reach the ground energy state, with a high probability, after an annealing process. They have been proposed as a way to solve SAT.
  These Hamiltonians can be seen as Max2XOR problems, i.e. as the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of XOR clauses of at most 2 variables that are satisfied. In this paper, we present several gadgets to reduce SAT to Max2XOR. We show how they can be used to translate SAT instances to initial configurations of a quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms in a Superposition of Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize our ability to process information. The advancement from classical to quantum computing is a product of our advancement from classical to quantum physics -- the more our understanding of the universe grows, so does our ability to use it for computation. A natural question that arises is, what will physics allow in the future? Can more advanced theories of physics increase our computational power, beyond quantum computing?
  An active field of research in physics studies theoretical phenomena outside the scope of explainable quantum mechanics, that form when attempting to combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) with General Relativity (GR) into a unified theory of Quantum Gravity (QG). QG is known to present the possibility of a quantum superposition of causal structure and event orderings. In the literature of quantum information theory, this translates to a superposition of unitary evolution orders.
  In this work we show a first example of a natural computational model based on QG, that provides an exponential speedup over standard quantum computation (under standard hardness assumptions). We define a model and complexity measure for a quantum computer that has the ability to generate a superposition of unitary evolution orders, and show that such computer is able to solve in polynomial time two of the fundamental problems in computer science: The Graph Isomorphism Problem ($\mathsf{GI}$) and the Gap Closest Vector Problem ($\mathsf{GapCVP}$), with gap $O\left( n \sqrt{n} \right)$. These problems are believed by experts to be hard to solve for a regular quantum computer. Interestingly, our model does not seem overpowered, and we found no obvious way to solve entire complexity classes that are considered hard in computer science, like the classes $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{SZK}$.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>

Abstract: We explore the relationship between Turing completeness and topological entropy of dynamical systems. We first prove that a natural class of Turing machines that we call "regular Turing machines" (which includes most of the examples of universal Turing machines) has positive topological entropy. We deduce that any Turing complete dynamics with a continuous encoding that simulates a universal machine in this class is chaotic. This applies to our previous constructions of Turing complete area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the disk and 3D stationary Euler flows. The article concludes with an appendix written by Ville Salo that introduces a method to construct universal Turing machines that are not regular and have zero topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Seed Selection in the Heterogeneous Moran Process</title>

Abstract: The Moran process is a classic stochastic process that models the rise and takeover of novel traits in network-structured populations. In biological terms, a set of mutants, each with fitness $m\in(0,\infty)$ invade a population of residents with fitness $1$. Each agent reproduces at a rate proportional to its fitness and each offspring replaces a random network neighbor. The process ends when the mutants either fixate (take over the whole population) or go extinct. The fixation probability measures the success of the invasion. To account for environmental heterogeneity, we study a generalization of the Standard process, called the Heterogeneous Moran process. Here, the fitness of each agent is determined both by its type (resident/mutant) and the node it occupies. We study the natural optimization problem of seed selection: given a budget $k$, which $k$ agents should initiate the mutant invasion to maximize the fixation probability? We show that the problem is strongly inapproximable: it is $\mathbf{NP}$-hard to distinguish between maximum fixation probability 0 and 1. We then focus on mutant-biased networks, where each node exhibits at least as large mutant fitness as resident fitness. We show that the problem remains $\mathbf{NP}$-hard, but the fixation probability becomes submodular, and thus the optimization problem admits a greedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation. An experimental evaluation of the greedy algorithm along with various heuristics on real-world data sets corroborates our results.</description>
