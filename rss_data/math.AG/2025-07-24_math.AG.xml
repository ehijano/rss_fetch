      <title>The Splitting Lemma in any Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple proof of the splitting lemma in singularity theory, also known as generalized Morse lemma, for formal power series over arbitrary fields. Our proof for the uniqueness of the residual part in any characteristic is new and was previously unknown in characteristic two. Beyond the formal case, we give proofs for algebraic power series and for convergent real and complex analytic power series, which are new for non-isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>Motivic classes of fixed-generators Hilbert schemes of unibranch curve singularities and Igusa zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17642v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the study of Hilbert schemes of unibranch plane curves whose points have a fixed number of minimal generators. Building on the work of Oblomkov, Rasmussen and Shende we provide a formula for their motivic classes and investigate the relationship with principal Hilbert schemes of the same given unibranch curve. In addition, the paper specializes this study to the case of $(p,q)$-curves, where we obtain more structured results for the motivic classes of fixed-generators Hilbert schemes: their positivity and topological invariance, and an explicit relationship to one-generator schemes i.e. principal ideals in $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{C,0}$. Finally, we focus on a special open component in the one-generator locus, whose motivic class is naturally related to the motivic measure on the arc scheme $\mathbb A^2_\infty$ of the plane introduced by Denef and Loeser as well as to the Igusa zeta function. We also provide an explicit formulation of these motivic classes in terms of an embedded resolution of the singularity, proving their polynomiality as well as making them an interesting topological invariant of the given curve.</description>

      <title>A derived category analogue of the Nakai--Moishezon criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete characterization of the line bundles on a proper variety whose tensor powers generate the derived category, answering a 2010 question of Chris Brav. The condition is analogous to the Nakai--Moishezon criterion and can be stated purely in terms of classical notions of positivity of line bundles. There is also a generalization which works for all Noetherian schemes. We use our criterion to prove basic properties of such line bundles and provide non-trivial examples of them. As an application, we give new examples of varieties which can be reconstructed from their derived categories in the sense of the Bondal--Orlov Reconstruction Theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantum TBA for refined BPS indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</description>

      <title>The Alpha Group Tensorial Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Alpha Group is an abstract geometry group in $\mathbb{R}^4$. The way it was conceived allows a new interpretation of the structure of hypercomplex space, with a new geometry and spatial topology, and a meaning for the geometric representation of $\mathbb{R}^4$ space to infinity. Therefore, it has been described as the tensorial metric formula in the Alpha Group. It will be shown that the Riemannian and Euclidean distance metrics between infinitesimal surfaces are represented as special cases of the metric of the Alpha Group.</description>

      <title>Multifold degeneracy points of quantum systems and singularities of matrix varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-dependent quantum systems often exhibit energy degeneracy points, whose comprehensive description naturally lead to the application of methods from singularity theory. A prime example is an electronic band structure where two energy levels coincide in a point of momentum space. It may happen, and this case is the focus of our work, that three or more levels coincide at a parameter point, called multifold degeneracy. Upon a generic perturbation, such a multifold degeneracy point is dissolved into a set of Weyl points, that is, generic two-fold degeneracy points. In this work, we provide an upper bound to the number of Weyl points born from the multifold degeneracy point. To compute this upper bound, we describe the geometric degeneracy variety in the space of complex matrices. We compute its multiplicity at certain singular points corresponding to a multifold degeneracy, and the multiplicity of holomorphic map germs with respect to this variety. Our work covers physics and mathematics aspects in detail, and attempts to bridge the two disciplines and communities. For self-containedness, we survey examples of multi-fold degeneracies in quantum systems and condensed-matter physics, as well as the established tools of local algebraic geometry that we use to identify the upper bound.</description>

      <title>An integral comparison of crystalline and de Rham cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be a mixed characteristic complete DVR with perfect residue field $k$ and fraction field $K$. It is a celebrated result of Berthelot and Ogus that for a smooth proper formal scheme $X/\mathcal{O}_K$ there exists a comparison between the de Rham cohomology groups $\mathrm{H}^i_\mathrm{dR}(X/\mathcal{O}_K)$ and the crystalline cohomology groups $\mathrm{H}^i_\mathrm{crys}(X_k/W(k))$ of the special fibre, after tensoring with $K$. In this article, we use the stacky perspective on prismatic cohomology, due to Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie, to give a version of this comparison result with coefficients in a perfect complex of prismatic $F$-crystals on $X$. Our method is of an integral nature and suggests new tools to understand the relationship between torsion in de Rham and crystalline cohomology.</description>

      <title>Indecomposability of derived categories in families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.00994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the moduli space of semiorthogonal decompositions in a smooth projective family, introduced by the second, the third and the fourth author, we propose a novel approach to indecomposability questions for derived categories. Modulo a natural conjecture on the structure of the moduli space, we give both general results, and discuss interesting explicit examples of the behaviour of indecomposability in families, by relating it to the behaviour of the canonical base locus in families. These examples are symmetric powers of curves, certain regular surfaces of general type with large canonical base locus, and Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces. Indecomposability for symmetric powers of curves has been settled via other means, the other cases remain open and we expect that our analysis of the base locus will prove instrumental in finding unconditional proofs.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kodaira dimension of the compactified n-fold Kuga variety over the moduli space of principally polarised abelian g-folds. We construct a suitable compactification, which we call a Namikawa compactification, and show that in most cases it has canonical singularities. We then use results about the slope of Siegel modular forms to determine the Kodaira dimension for all g&gt;1 and n&gt;0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a construction of the Coulomb branch of a $3d\ {\mathcal N}=4$ gauge theory corresponding to a choice of a connected reductive group $G$ and a symplectic finite-dimensional reprsentation $\mathbf M$ of $G$, satisfying certain anomaly cancellation condition. This extends the construction of arXiv:1601.03586 (where it was assumed that ${\mathbf M}={\mathbf N}\oplus{\mathbf N}^*$ for some representation $\mathbf N$ of $G$). Our construction goes through certain "universal" ring object in the twisted derived Satake category of the symplectic group $Sp(2n)$. The construction of this object uses a categorical version of the Weil representation; we also compute the image of this object under the (twisted) derived Satake equivalence and show that it can be obtained from the theta-sheaf introduced by S.Lysenko on $\operatorname{Bun}_{Sp(2n)}({\mathbb P}^1)$ via certain Radon transform. We also discuss applications of our construction to a potential mathematical construction of $S$-duality for super-symmetric boundary conditions in 4-dimensional gauge theory and to (some extension of) the conjectures of D.Ben-Zvi, Y.Sakellaridis and A.Venkatesh.</description>

Abstract: For a vector bundle $\mathcal E \to \mathbb P^\ell$ we investigate exceptional sequences of line bundles on the total space of the projectivisation $X = \mathbb P(\mathcal E)$. In particular, we consider the case of the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb P^\ell$. If $\ell = 2$, we completely classify the (strong) exceptional sequences and show that any maximal exceptional sequence is full. For general $\ell$, we prove that the Rouquier dimension of $\mathcal D(X)$ equals $\dim X$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Orlov.</description>

      <title>Classification of simple 0-dimensional isolated complete intersection singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is the classification of simple 0-dimensional isolated complete intersection singularities in positive characteristic. As usual, a singularity is called simple or 0-modal if there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of singularities into which the given singularity can deform. The notion of simpleness was introduced by V. I. Arnold and the classification of low modality singularities has become a fundamental task in singularity theory. Simple complex analytic isolated complete intersection singularities (ICIS) were classified by M. Giusti. However, the classification in positive characteristic requires different methods and is much more involved. The final result is nevertheless similar to the classification in characteristic 0 with some additional normal forms in low characteristic. The theoretical results in this paper mainly concern families of ICIS that are formal in the fiber and algebraic in the base (formal deformation theory is not sufficient).

      <title>Localizing and colocalizing subcategories on schemes</title>

Abstract: A full triangulated subcategory $\mathsf{L} \subset \mathsf{T}$ of triangulated category $\mathsf{T}$ is \emph{localizing} if it is stable for coproducts. If, further, $\mathsf{T}$ is $\otimes$-triangulated, we say that $\mathsf{L}$ is $\otimes$-ideal if $F \otimes G \in \mathsf{L}$ for all $G \in \mathsf{L}$ and all $F \in \mathsf{T}$. Analogously, a full triangulated subcategory $\mathsf{C} \subset \mathsf{T}$ is \emph{colocalizing} if it is stable for products. If, further, $\mathsf{T}$ is \emph{closed}, \textit{i.e.} $\otimes$-triangulated with internal homs (denoted $[-,-]$), we say that $\mathsf{C}$ is $\mathcal{H}$-coideal if $[F, G] \in \mathsf{C}$ for all $G \in \mathsf{C}$ and all $F \in \mathsf{T}$.
  For a point generated concentrated scheme $X$, we prove that all $\otimes$-ideal localizing subcategories of $\mathbf{D}_{qc}(X)$ are classified by the subsets of $X$. As a consequence, we prove that for $\mathcal{H}$-coideal colocalizing subcategories of $\mathbf{D}_{qc}(X)$ the same holds. Moreover, every such colocalizing subcategory $\mathsf{C}$ is of the form $\mathsf{C} = \mathsf{L}^\perp$, where $\mathsf{L}$ is a $\otimes$-ideal localizing subcategory.</description>

      <title>Perfectoidness via Sen Theory and Applications to Shimura Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sen's theorem on the ramification of a $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic local fields shows that its perfectoidness is equivalent to the non-vanishing of its arithmetic Sen operator. By developing $p$-adic Hodge theory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen's criterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its (Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing of the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application, we prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher degrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>Polymatroid Schubert varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lattice of flats $\mathcal L_M$ of a matroid $M$ is combinatorially well-behaved and, when $M$ is realizable, admits a geometric model in the form of a "matroid Schubert variety". In contrast, the lattice of flats of a polymatroid exhibits many combinatorial pathologies and admits no similar geometric model.
  We address this situation by defining the lattice $\mathcal L_P$ of "combinatorial flats" of a polymatroid $P$. Combinatorially, $\mathcal L_P$ exhibits good behavior analogous to that of $\mathcal L_M$: it is graded, determines $P$ when $P$ is simple, and is top-heavy. When $P$ is realizable over a field of characteristic 0, we show that $\mathcal L_P$ is modelled by a "polymatroid Schubert variety".
  Our work generalizes a number of results of Ardila-Boocher and Huh-Wang on matroid Schubert varieties; however, the geometry of polymatroid Schubert varieties is noticeably more complicated than that of matroid Schubert varieties. Many natural questions remain open.</description>

      <title>Enumerative Geometry of Quantum Periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret the $q$-refined theta function $\vartheta_1$ of a log Calabi-Yau surface $(\mathbb{P},E)$ as a natural $q$-refinement of the open mirror map, defined by quantum periods of mirror curves for outer Aganagic-Vafa branes on the local Calabi-Yau $K_{\mathbb{P}}$. The series coefficients are all-genus logarithmic two-point invariants, directly extending the relation found in [GRZ]. Yet we find an explicit discrepancy at higher genus in the relation to open Gromov-Witten invariants of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. Using a degeneration argument, we express the difference in terms of relative invariants of an elliptic curve. With $\pi: \widehat{\mathbb{P}} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}$ the toric blow up of a point, we use the Topological Vertex [AKMV] to show a correspondence between open invariants of $K_{\mathbb{P}}$ and closed invariants of $K_{\widehat{\mathbb{P}}}$ generalizing a variant of [CLLT][LLW] to arbitrary genus and winding. We also equate winding-1, open-BPS invariants with closed Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.</description>

      <title>A converse to Cartan's Theorem B: The extension property for real analytic and Nash sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1957 Cartan proved his celebrated Theorem B and deduced that if $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ is an open set and $X$ is a coherent real analytic subset of $\Omega$, then $X$ has the analytic extension property, that is, each real analytic function on $X$ extends to a real analytic function on $\Omega$. The converse implication in its full generality remains unproven. In the literature only special cases of non-coherent real analytic sets $X\subset\Omega$ without the extension property appear, some of them due to Cartan himself: mainly real analytic sets $X\subset\Omega$ that have a visible `tail'.
  We prove the converse implication: If a subset $X$ of $\Omega$ has the analytic extension property, it is a coherent real analytic subset of $\Omega$. The class of sets with the analytic extension property coincides with that of coherent real analytic sets.
  We extend the previous characterization to the Nash case, which is somehow more demanding, because of its finiteness properties and its disappointing behavior with respect to cohomology of sheaves of Nash function germs. Let $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ be an open semialgebraic set and let $X\subset\Omega$ be a set. We prove that each Nash function on $X$ extends to a Nash function on $\Omega$ if and only if $X\subset\Omega$ is a coherent Nash set. The `if' implication goes back to some celebrated results of Coste, Ruiz and Shiota.
  If $M\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ is a Nash manifold, ${\mathcal C}^\infty$ semialgebraic functions on $M$ coincide with Nash functions on $M$. As an application, we confront the coherence of a Nash set $X\subset\Omega$ with the fact that each ${\mathcal C}^\infty$ semialgebraic function on $X$ is a Nash function on $X$. We provide a full characterization of the semialgebraic sets $S\subset\Omega$ for which ${\mathcal C}^\infty$ semialgebraic functions on $S$ coincide with Nash functions on $S$.</description>

      <title>Generating systems, generalized Thomsen collections and derived categories of toric varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bondal claims that for a smooth toric variety $X$, its bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $D_{c}^{b}(X)$ is generated by the Thomsen collection $T(X)$ of line bundles obtained as direct summands of the pushforward of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ along a Frobenius map with sufficiently divisible degree. The claim is confirmed recently. In this article, we consider a generalized Thomsen collection of line bundles $T(X,D)$ with a $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor $D$ as an auxiliary input, which recovers Thomsen's oringinal collection by setting $D=0$. We introduce the notion of a generating system and prove a theorem on the generation of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ using many line bundles arising from the generating system. As an application, we verify Bondal's claim for some toric varieties, using a different argument from existing works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the finiteness of the N\'eron-Severi lattices of complex projective K3 surfaces whose automorphism groups are non-elementary hyperbolic with explicit descriptions, under the assumption that the Picard number $\ge 6$ which is optimal to ensure the finiteness. Our proof of finiteness is based on the study of genus one fibrations on K3 surfaces and recent work of Kikuta and Takatsu.</description>

      <title>Relative Calabi-Yau structures and ice quivers with potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Van den Bergh showed that complete 3-Calabi-Yau algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are equivalent to Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential. He also proved the natural generalisation to higher dimensions and non-algebraically closed ground fields. The relative version of the notion of Ginzburg dg algebra is that of Ginzburg morphism. For example, every ice quiver with potential gives rise to a Ginzburg morphism. We generalise Van den Bergh's theorem by showing that, under suitable assumptions, any morphism with a relative Calabi-Yau structure is equivalent to a Ginzburg(-Lazaroiu) morphism. In particular, in dimension 3 and over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic 0, it is given by an ice quiver with potential. Thanks to the work of Bozec-Calaque-Scherotzke, this result can also be viewed as a non-commutative analogue of Joyce-Safronov's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem in derived symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>Determination Problems for Orbit Closures and Matrix Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational problems concerning the orbit of a point under the action of a matrix group occur throughout computer science, including in program analysis, complexity theory, quantum computation, and automata theory. In many cases the focus extends beyond orbits proper to orbit closures under a suitable topology. Typically one starts from a group and a set of points and asks questions about the orbit closure of the set under the action of the group, e.g., whether two given orbit closures intersect.
  In this paper we consider a collection of what we call determination problems concerning matrix groups and orbit closures. These problems begin with a given variety and seek to understand whether and how it arises either as an algebraic matrix group or as an orbit closure. The how question asks whether the underlying group is $s$-generated, meaning it is topologically generated by $s$ matrices for a given number $s$. Among other applications, problems of this type have recently been studied in the context of synthesising loops subject to certain specified invariants on program variables.
  Our main result is a polynomial-space procedure that inputs a variety and a number $s$ and determines whether the given variety arises as an orbit closure of a point under an $s$-generated commutative algebraic matrix group. The main tools in our approach are structural properties of commutative algebraic matrix groups and module theory. We leave open the question of determining whether a variety is an orbit closure of a point under an $s$-generated algebraic matrix group (without the requirement of commutativity).</description>
