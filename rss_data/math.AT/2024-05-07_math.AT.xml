      <title>Characterization of locally standard, $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariantly formal manifolds in general position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a characterization of locally standard, $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariantly formal manifolds in general position. In particular, we show that for dimension $2n$ at least $10$, to every such manifold with labeled GKM graph $\Gamma$ there is an equivariantly formal torus manifold such that the restriction of the $T^n$-action to a certain $T^{n-1}$-action yields the same labeled graph $\Gamma$, thus showing that the (equivariant) cohomology with $\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients of those manifolds has the same description as that of equivariantly formal torus manifolds.</description>

      <title>Cofinality Theorems of Infinity Categories and Algebraic K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theorem that proves a condition when an inclusion morphism between simplicial sets becomes a weak homotopy equivalence. Additionally, we present two applications of this result. The first application demonstrates that cofinal full inclusion functors of (\infty)-categories are weak homotopy equivalences. For our second application, we provide an alternative proof of Barwick's cofinality theorem of algebraic (K)-theory.</description>

      <title>Immersions of 3-manifolds into the 5-space, almost contact structures, and complex tangents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wu invariant is a regular homotopy invariant for immersions of oriented 3-manifolds into the 5-space. In this paper, we present new expressions and vanishing theorems for the invariant, from the viewpoint of almost contact structures and complex tangents. As an application, we determine the regular homotopy classes of inclusion maps of the surface singularity links of type ADE into the 5-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study operations on functors in the category of abelian groups simplar to the derivation in the sense of Dold-Puppe. They are defined as derived limits of a functor applied to the relation subgroup over a category of free presentations of the group. The integral homology of the Eilenberg-Maclane space $K(\mathbb Z,3)$ appears as a part of description of these operations applied to symmetric powers.</description>

      <title>Compact and finite-type support in the homology of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-theory and Artin $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Quillen-Lichtenbaum Conjecture relating special values of Dedekind zeta functions to algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups. The former has been settled by Rost-Voevodsky up to the Iwasawa Main Conjecture. Our generalization extends the scope of this conjecture to Artin $L$-functions of Galois representations of finite, function, and totally real number fields. The statement of this conjecture relates norms of the special values of these $L$-functions to sizes of equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups with coefficients in an equivariant Moore spectrum attached to a Galois representation.
  We prove this conjecture in many cases, integrally, except up to a possible factor of powers of $2$ in the non-abelian and totally real number field case. In the finite field case, we further determine the group structures of their equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups with coefficients in Galois representations. At heart, our method lifts the M\"obius inversion formula for factorizations of zeta functions as a product of $L$-functions, to the $E_1$-page of an equivariant spectral sequence converging to equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups. Additionally, the spectral Mackey functor structure on equivariant $\mathrm{K}$-theory allows us to incorporate certain ramified extensions that appear in these $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>A topological model for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the first known topological model for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial. More precisely, we prove that this invariant is given by a set of graded intersections between explicit Lagrangian submanifolds in a fixed configuration space on a Heegaard surface for the link exterior. The submanifolds are supported on arcs and ovals on the surface.
  The construction also leads to a topological model for the Jones polynomial constructed from Heegaard surfaces associated directly to the link diagram. In particular, it does not rely on a choice of a braid representative for the link. This opens up new avenues for investigation of the geometry of these invariants, as well as categorifications of geometric nature.</description>

      <title>Chern-Dold character in complex cobordisms and theta divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.05782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the smooth theta divisors of general principally polarised abelian varieties can be chosen as irreducible algebraic representatives of the coefficients of the Chern-Dold character in complex cobordisms and describe the action of the Landweber-Novikov operations on them. We introduce a quantisation of the complex cobordism theory with the dual Landweber-Novikov algebra as the deformation parameter space and show that the Chern-Dold character can be interpreted as the composition of quantisation and dequantisation maps. Some smooth real-analytic representatives of the cobordism classes of theta divisors are described in terms of the classical Weierstrass elliptic functions. The link with the Milnor-Hirzebruch problem about possible characteristic numbers of irreducible algebraic varieties is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $V$ a finite dimensional (non-zero) orthogonal $G$-module such that, for each prime $p$ dividing the order of $G$, the subspace of $V$ fixed by a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ is non-zero and, if the dimension of $V$ is odd, has dimension greater than $1$. Using ideas of Avvakumov, Karasev, Kudrya and Skopenkov and work of Noakes on self-maps of sphere bundles, we show that, for any principal $G$-bundle $P\to X$ over a compact ENR $X$, there exists a $G$-map from $P$ to the unit sphere $S(V)$ in $V$.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard diffeology and generalized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonstandard extension of the category of diffeological spaces, and demonstrate its application to the study of generalized functions. Just as diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of Euclidean open sets, our nonstandard diffeological spaces are defined as concrete sheaves on the site of open subsets of nonstandard Euclidean spaces, i.e. finite dimensional vector spaces over (the quasi-asymptotic variant of) Robinson's hyperreal numbers. It is shown that nonstandard diffeological spaces form a category which is enriched over the category of diffeological spaces, is closed under small limits and colimits, and is cartesian closed. Furthermore, it can be shown that the space of nonstandard functions on the extension of a Euclidean open set is a smooth differential algebra that admits an embedding of the differential vector space of Schwartz distributions. Since our algebra of generalized functions comes as a hom-object in a category, it enables not only the multiplication of distributions but also the composition of them. To illustrate the usefulness of this property we show that the homotopy extension property can be established for smooth relative cell complexes by exploiting extended maps.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry using a flat connection on the space of 1-forms on a formally smooth associative algebra. We then extend this construction to the case of associative algebras with any finite cohomological dimension, which allows us to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra via geometry over Lie operad.</description>

Abstract: For any smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $d\geq4$ we construct explicit classes in homotopy groups of spaces of embeddings of either an arc or a circle into $M$, in every degree that is a multiple of $d-3$, and show that they are detected in the Taylor tower of Goodwillie and Weiss. The classes are obtained from families of string links constructed in the $d$-ball.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Deconfinement Transition for Potts Lattice Gauge Theory in Codimension Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Aizenman, Chayes, Chayes, Fr\"ohlich, and Russo proved that $2$-dimensional Bernoulli plaquette percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^3$ exhibits a sharp phase transition for the event that a large rectangular loop is "bounded by a surface of plaquettes.'' We extend this result both to $(d-1)$-dimensional plaquette percolation in $\mathbb{Z}^d,$ and to a dependent model of plaquette percolation called the plaquette random-cluster model. As a consequence, we obtain a sharp phase transition for Wilson loop expectations in $(d-2)$-dimensional $q$-state Potts hyperlattice gauge theory on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ dual to that of the Potts model. Our proof is unconditional for Ising lattice gauge theory, but relies on a regularity conjecture for the random-cluster model in slabs when $q&gt;2.$ We also further develop the general theory of the $i$-plaquette random cluster model and its relationship with $(i-1)$-dimensional Potts lattice gauge</description>
