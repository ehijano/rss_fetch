      <title>American option pricing using generalised stochastic hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to pricing American options using piecewise diffusion Markov processes (PDifMPs), a type of generalised stochastic hybrid system that integrates continuous dynamics with discrete jump processes. Standard models often rely on constant drift and volatility assumptions, which limits their ability to accurately capture the complex and erratic nature of financial markets. By incorporating PDifMPs, our method accounts for sudden market fluctuations, providing a more realistic model of asset price dynamics. We benchmark our approach with the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm, both in its original form and modified to include PDifMP asset price trajectories. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our PDifMP-based method not only provides a more accurate reflection of market behaviour but also offers practical advantages in terms of computational efficiency. The results suggest that PDifMPs can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of American options pricing by more closely aligning with the stochastic volatility and jumps observed in real financial markets.</description>

      <title>MarS: a Financial Market Simulation Engine Powered by Generative Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models aim to simulate realistic effects of various actions across different contexts, from text generation to visual effects. Despite efforts to build real-world simulators, leveraging generative models for virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains underexplored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate market effects of various behaviors, enabling interaction with market scenes and players, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key objectives of this paper include evaluating LMM's scaling law in financial markets, assessing MarS's realism, balancing controlled generation with market impact, and demonstrating MarS's potential applications. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment. Our contributions include pioneering a generative model for financial markets, designing MarS to meet domain-specific needs, and demonstrating MarS-based applications' industry potential.</description>

      <title>MoA is All You Need: Building LLM Research Team using Mixture of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) research in the financial domain is particularly complex due to the sheer number of approaches proposed in literature. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the leading methods in the sector due to its inherent groundedness and data source variability. In this work, we introduce a RAG framework called Mixture of Agents (MoA) and demonstrate its viability as a practical, customizable, and highly effective approach for scaling RAG applications. MoA is essentially a layered network of individually customized small language models (Hoffmann et al., 2022) collaborating to answer questions and extract information. While there are many theoretical propositions for such an architecture and even a few libraries for generally applying the structure in practice, there are limited documented studies evaluating the potential of this framework considering real business constraints such as cost and speed. We find that the MoA framework, consisting of small language models (Hoffmann et al., 2022), produces higher quality and more grounded responses across various financial domains that are core to Vanguard's business while simultaneously maintaining low costs.</description>

      <title>Pricing Barrier Options with DeepBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.10966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and direct approach to price boundary and final-value problems, corresponding to barrier options, using forward deep learning to solve forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). Barrier instruments are instruments that expire or transform into another instrument if a barrier condition is satisfied before maturity; otherwise they perform like the instrument without the barrier condition. In the PDE formulation, this corresponds to adding boundary conditions to the final value problem. The deep BSDE methods developed so far have not addressed barrier/boundary conditions directly. We extend the forward deep BSDE to the barrier condition case by adding nodes to the computational graph to explicitly monitor the barrier conditions for each realization of the dynamics as well as nodes that preserve the time, state variables, and trading strategy value at barrier breach or at maturity otherwise. Given these additional nodes in the computational graph, the forward loss function quantifies the replication of the barrier or final payoff according to a chosen risk measure such as squared sum of differences. The proposed method can handle any barrier condition in the FBSDE set-up and any Dirichlet boundary conditions in the PDE set-up, both in low and high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Failure of Fourier pricing techniques to approximate the Greeks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08421v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Greeks Delta and Gamma of plain vanilla options play a fundamental role in finance, e.g., in hedging or risk management. These Greeks are approximated in many models such as the widely used Variance Gamma model by Fourier techniques such as the Carr-Madan formula, the COS method or the Lewis formula. However, for some realistic market parameters, we show empirically that these three Fourier methods completely fail to approximate the Gamma. As a solution, we propose to use finite differences instead to obtain the Greeks</description>

      <title>Robust financial calibration: a Bayesian approach for neural SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a Bayesian framework for the calibration of financial models using neural stochastic differential equations (neural SDEs). The method is based on the specification of a prior distribution on the neural network weights and an adequately chosen likelihood function. The resulting posterior distribution can be seen as a mixture of different classical neural SDE models yielding robust bounds on the implied volatility surface. Both, historical financial time series data and option price data are taken into consideration, which necessitates a methodology to learn the change of measure between the risk-neutral and the historical measure. The key ingredient for a robust numerical optimization of the neural networks is to apply a Langevin-type algorithm, commonly used in the Bayesian approaches to draw posterior samples.</description>

      <title>Reconciling rough volatility with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconcile rough volatility models and jump models using a class of reversionary Heston models with fast mean reversions and large vol-of-vols. Starting from hyper-rough Heston models with a Hurst index $H \in (-1/2,1/2)$, we derive a Markovian approximating class of one dimensional reversionary Heston-type models. Such proxies encode a trade-off between an exploding vol-of-vol and a fast mean-reversion speed controlled by a reversionary time-scale $\epsilon&gt;0$ and an unconstrained parameter $H \in \mathbb R$. Sending $\epsilon$ to 0 yields convergence of the reversionary Heston model towards different explicit asymptotic regimes based on the value of the parameter H. In particular, for $H \leq -1/2$, the reversionary Heston model converges to a class of L\'evy jump processes of Normal Inverse Gaussian type. Numerical illustrations show that the reversionary Heston model is capable of generating at-the-money skews similar to the ones generated by rough, hyper-rough and jump models.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>
