      <title>A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds - Stabilized finite element formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a stabilized finite element formulation of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) surface theory for Navier-Stokes flow on self-evolving manifolds developed in Sauer (2025). The formulation is physically frame-invariant, applicable to large deformations, and relevant to fluidic surfaces such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid membranes, which are complex and inherently unstable physical systems. It is applied here to area-incompressible surface flows using a stabilized pressure-velocity (or surface tension-velocity) formulation based on quadratic finite elements and implicit time integration. The unknown ALE mesh motion is determined by membrane elasticity such that the in-plane mesh motion is stabilized without affecting the physical behavior of the system. The resulting three-field system is monolithically coupled, and fully linearized within the Newton-Rhapson solution method. The new formulation is demonstrated on several challenging examples including shear flow on self-evolving surfaces and inflating soap bubbles with partial inflow on evolving boundaries. Optimal convergence rates are obtained in all cases. Particularly advantageous are C1-continuous surface discretizations, for example based on NURBS.</description>

      <title>Trends in porous media laboratory imaging and open science practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding processes in porous media is fundamental to a broad spectrum of environmental, energy, and geoscience applications. These processes include multiphase fluid transport, interfacial dynamics, reactive transformations, and interactions with solids or microbial components, all governed by wettability, capillarity, and reactive transport at fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces. Laboratory-based multiscale imaging provides critical insights into these phenomena, enabling direct visualization and quantitative characterization from the nanometer to meter scale. It is essential for advancing predictive models and optimizing the design of subsurface and engineered porous systems. This review presents an integrated overview of imaging techniques relevant to porous media research, emphasizing the type of information each method can provide, their applicability to porous media systems, and their inherent limitations. We highlight how imaging data are combined with quantitative analyses and modeling to bridge pore-scale mechanisms with continuum-scale behavior, and we critically discuss current challenges such as limited spatio-temporal resolution, sample representativity, and restricted data accessibility. We conduct an in-depth analysis on open-science trends in experimental and computational porous media research and find that, while open-access publishing has become widespread, the availability of imaging data and analysis code remains limited, often restricted to 'upon request'. Finally, we underscore the importance of open sharing of imaging datasets to enable reproducibility, foster cross-disciplinary integration, and support the development of robust predictive frameworks for porous media systems.</description>

      <title>Flow Development in the Entrance Region of Slender Converging Pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic entrance region in internal conduits, where the velocity profile evolves to a fully developed state, is a classical problem in fluid mechanics. Although many fundamental studies involve developing flows in circular ducts with constant area -- for which several theoretical descriptions exist -- converging pipe sections are often employed, demanding the extension of the analysis to pipes with slowly varying areas. This work presents an analytical investigation of the hydrodynamic entrance region in laminar axisymmetric flows through slender converging pipes at moderate Reynolds numbers. The theoretical model extends the recent analysis for developing flows in straight pipes by adopting a classical approach where the flow is divided radially into two regions: a wall region, where viscous effects are dominant and advection is neglected, and a central core, where both inertia and viscous effects are considered. The effects of the inlet Reynolds number and the inlet angle on the developing velocity profile and pressure drop are analysed. Results show that a converging geometry, which imposes a favourable pressure gradient, shortens the hydrodynamic entrance length compared to a straight pipe at the same inlet Reynolds number. The analytical solutions for the evolution of the velocity field are validated against numerical simulations of the full Navier-Stokes equations, showing good agreement. The model provides a concise theoretical description of the interaction between boundary-layer development and pressure gradients in the entrance region of laminar flows in slender converging pipes.</description>

      <title>Frozen states in shear-induced coagulation: When history matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a frozen state in decaying turbulent coagulation where the moment ratio M_C stabilizes at 4.5, defying the theoretical prediction of 2 for homogeneous systems. This persistent state emerges from historical memory effects that freeze spatial correlations, challenging the reduction of spatially extended systems to zero-dimensional models. Our findings fundamentally reshape the understanding of long-term coagulation dynamics with immediate implications for aerosol science and industrial processing.</description>

      <title>Global non-equilibrium thermodynamics of stationary states applied to the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical thermodynamics describes physical systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, characterized in particular by the absence of macroscopic motion. Global non-equilibrium thermodynamics extends this framework to include physical systems in stationary states (Ho{\l}yst et al., EPL 149, 30001 (2025)). Here, we demonstrate that this extended theory captures macroscopic motion in stationary states, thereby providing a unified framework for global thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. We apply the theory to stationary Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and show how the second law of global non-equilibrium thermodynamics determines the direction of changes in fluid motion.</description>

      <title>Viscosity and dynamic surface tension measurement: A guideline for appropriate measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic surface tension measurements play a critical role in interfacial activities for liquids with varying viscosities. Understanding the rate at which the interface attains the equilibrium, for surface tension measurements, after the formation of a new interface is of significant interest. Although surface tension is independent of viscosity, the time required for a new surface to form (equilibrium/relaxation time) is influenced by viscosity. The measured surface tension value is accurate only once these viscous effects have subsided. Therefore, the relaxation time represents the minimum surface age value achievable during the measurement process. We experimentally established the minimum surface age needed to measure the dynamic and static surface tension of a fluid with a specific viscosity using three widely used methods: the Pendant drop method, the Wilhelmy plate method, and the Bubble pressure method. We propose a guideline with a phase plot that helps to choose the most suitable method and the youngest achievable surface age for an accurate measurement, independent of viscous effects. This guideline enables users in diverse applications such as 3D printed clothing, spray paint, coating, etc., to accurately measure dynamic and static surface tension without being influenced by viscosity effects.</description>

      <title>Transient almost-invariant sets reveal convective heat transfer patterns in plane-layer Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontally extended plane-layer convection flows are characterized by characteristic patterns of turbulent heat transfer due to the convective fluid motion consisting of a nearly-regular ridge network where hot fluid rises and cold fluid sinks. Here, we analyse this transport behavior by the so-called inflated generator framework, which identifies quasi-stationary families of almost-invariant sets, derived from leading inflated generator eigenvectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven analysis framework in three-dimensional turbulent flow, by extracting transient characteristic heat transfer patterns as families of almost-invariant sets subject to a transient evolution, which contribute least to the convective heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Curl of Vorticity as a Precursor to Dissipation in 3D Taylor--Green Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting when a three-dimensional turbulent flow reaches its dissipation peak is essential for both theory and adaptive algorithms in simulations and experiments. Using direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the Taylor--Green vortex (TGV) at resolutions of $256^3$--$1024^3$, we introduce and test a small-scale weighted diagnostic: the spectrum of $|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2$ (with $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla \times \mathbf{u}$), which, for incompressible flow, is equivalent to a $k^4$-weighted energy spectrum. We show that the peak wavenumber of this spectrum, $k_{{\rm peak}}[\,|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\,]$, advances rapidly to intermediate--small scales and then levels off \emph{before} the dissipation rate $\varepsilon(t)=\sum_k 2\nu k^2 E(k)$ reaches its maximum. Across all resolutions, we observe robust temporal ordering $t_k&lt;t_\varepsilon&lt;t_\Pi$, where $t_k$ marks the onset of the rapid rise of $k_{{\rm peak}}[\,|\nabla \times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2\,]$, $t_\varepsilon$ is the time of the maximal $\varepsilon(t)$, and $t_\Pi$ is when the cumulative flux $|\Pi(K)|$ attains its largest peak scale. This early-warning signal correlates with the morphological transition to filament-dominated structures visible in $Q$-criterion isosurfaces and is consistent with integral-scale trends ($L_{{\rm int}},\lambda,\eta$). The diagnostic is simple to compute from standard DNS data and highlights the incipient formation of high-curvature structures, where viscosity acts most strongly.</description>

      <title>Radially weighted Backus- and Childress-type bounds for spherical dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In MHD dynamo theory well-known necessary criteria for dynamo action are formulated in terms of lower bounds either on the maximum modulus of the velocity field (Childress-type) or the maximum strain of the velocity field (Backus-type). We generalize these criteria for spherical dynamos by introducing a radially varying weight $f(r)$. The corresponding {\em l}ower {\em b}ound Reynolds numbers $R_{lb}^C [f]$ (based on velocity) and $R_{lb}^B [f]$ (based on strain) are determined for two types of such weights: a power law profile $f(r) = r^\alpha$, $0\leq \alpha \leq 2$ and an optimal radial profile $f_v$ depending on the velocity field $\bf{v}$ in question.
  To assess the quality of these lower bounds we compare them with weighted critical Reynolds numbers $R_c^C$ (Childress-type) and $R_c^B$ (Backus-type), respectively, for the onset of dynamo action of the well known efficient $s_2t_2$ velocity field (Dudley \&amp; James 1989) and a recently determined ``most efficient'' velocity field (Chen et al.\ 2018). For the latter field we find a Backus-type ratio $R^B_c /R^B_{lb}$ of about $6.4$ with the optimal profile compared to a ratio of about $16.3$ without weight.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method for Multiple Time Steps Without Reinitialization for Linear Advection-Diffusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To simulate highly-resolved flow fields, we extend the Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) to be able to simulate multiple time steps without state extraction or reinitialization. We adjust and extend given QLBM approaches from the literature to completely remove the need to measure or reinitialize the flow field in between the simulation time steps. Therefore, our algorithm does not require to sample the entire flow field at any time. We solve the linear advection-diffusion problem and derive all necessary equations and build the corresponding quantum circuit diagrams, including details on the QLBM blocks and explicitly drawing the circuit gates. We discuss the general decay of a QLBM step and how that effects our algorithm. The new algorithm is verified on 1D and 2D test cases using the shot method of IBMs Qiskit package. We show excellent agreement and convergence between our QLBM and classical LBM methods. The conclusion section includes a discussion on the advantages of our algorithm as well as limitations and to what extent it is more efficient.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Closure in RANS and Flow Inference around a Cylinder using PINNs and Sparse Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) closures, based on the Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis and calibrated on canonical flows, often yield inaccurate predictions of both mean flow and turbulence statistics. Here, we consider flow past a circular cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers (3,900-100,000) and Mach numbers (0-0.3), encompassing incompressible and weakly compressible regimes, with the goal of improving predictions of mean velocity and Reynolds stresses. To this end, we assemble a cross-validated dataset comprising hydrodynamic particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a towing tank, aerodynamic PIV in a wind tunnel, and high-fidelity spectral element DNS and LES. Analysis of these data reveals a universal distribution of Reynolds stresses across the parameter space, which provides the foundation for a data-driven closure. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), trained with the unclosed RANS equations, to infer the velocity field and Reynolds-stress forcing from boundary information alone. The resulting closure, embedded in a forward PINN solver, significantly improves RANS predictions of both mean flow and turbulence statistics relative to conventional models.</description>

      <title>Effect of viscoelasticity on electrohydrodynamic drop deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of viscoelasticity on drop deformation in the presence of an electric field is investigated using both analytical and numerical methods. The study focuses on two configurations: a viscoelastic drop suspended in a Newtonian fluid and a Newtonian drop suspended in a viscoelastic medium. Oldroyd-B constitutive equation is employed to model constant viscosity viscoelasticity. Effect of Deborah number (ratio of polymer relaxation time to convective time scale) on drop deformation is studied and explained by examining the electric, elastic and viscous stresses at the interface. For small deformations, we apply the method of domain perturbations, and show that the viscoelastic properties of the drop significantly influence its deformation more than when the surrounding fluid is viscoelastic. Numerical computations are performed using a finite volume framework for larger drop deformations. The transient dynamics of the drops show distinct oscillatory patterns before eventually stabilizing at a steady deformation value. We observe a trend of decreased deformation in both configurations as the Deborah number increases. Relative magnitude of normal and tangential stresses plays a crucial role in drop deformation.</description>

      <title>Mapping surface height dynamics to subsurface flow physics in free-surface turbulent flow using a shallow recurrent decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-surface turbulent flows beneath a free surface are reconstructed from sparse measurements of the surface height variation, by a novel neural network algorithm known as the SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED). The reconstruction of turbulent flow fields from limited, partial, or indirect measurements remains a grand challenge in science and engineering. The central goal in such applications is to leverage easy-to-measure proxy variables in order to estimate quantities which have not been, and perhaps cannot in practice be, measured. Specifically, in the application considered here, the aim is to use a sparse number of surface height point measurements of a flow field, or drone video footage of surface features, in order to infer the turbulent flow field beneath the surface. SHRED is a deep learning architecture that learns a delay-coordinate embedding from a few surface height (point) sensors and maps it, via a shallow decoder trained in a compressed basis, to full subsurface fields, enabling fast, robust training from minimal data. We demonstrate the SHRED sensing architecture on both fully resolved DNS data and PIV laboratory data from a turbulent water tank. SHRED is capable of robustly mapping surface height fluctuations to full-state flow fields up to about two integral length scales deep, with as few as three surface measurements.</description>

      <title>Transitional and Near-Wall Turbulence Dynamics over Rib-Roughened Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study utilizes Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to investigate the impact of longitudinal triangular riblets on the laminar-to-turbulent transition in boundary layer flow. Five cases are examined: one involving a flat plate and four with ribbed plates. Among the ribbed cases, three use a riblet aspect ratio of two, whereas one has an aspect ratio of one. Arrays of longitudinal triangular riblets are positioned on a flat plate, and the transition to turbulence is initiated by controlled excitation of a Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave imposed on a Blasius velocity profile in a stable region. The longitudinal triangular riblets attenuate the TS wave, leading to a lower growth rate of turbulence. For higher riblet height ($h$) and width ($w$), with inner-scaled dimensions $h^+ = 25$, $w^+ = S^+ = 50$ (where $S$ is the spacing between two riblets), an early transition is triggered by high-frequency disturbances generated at the leading edge of the roughness elements. However, increasing riblet spacing to $S^+ = 75$ delays the transition by 17.5 percent. Both cases exhibited increased drag compared to the flat plate. For $h^+ = 12.5$ and $w^+ = S^+ = 25$, transition was delayed by 37 percent, with a modest overall drag reduction of 8.8 percent. The most significant result from the considered cases, $h^+ = w^+ = S^+ = 12.5$, showed a 47 percent delay in transition and a 13.69 percent reduction in overall drag. Smaller riblets cause minimal disturbance at the leading edge of roughness, resulting in a transition mechanism similar to a flat plate, while also reducing pressure loss, secondary flows, and velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer modulation in Phase Change Materials via fin insertion</title>

Abstract: We leverage a large set of numerical simulations to study optimized geometrical configurations for Phase Change Materials (PCMs) cells. We consider a PCM cell as a square enclosure with a solid substance that undergoes melting under the effect of a heat source from one side and under the effects of buoyancy forces. Moreover, an additional source fin with prescribed length $l$ and height $h$ protrudes into the cell perpendicularly from the heat source. The fin prompts enhanced heat transfer and convection within the PCM cell, thus shortening (in comparison to a finless cell) the melting time $t_m$ needed for all the PCM material to melt and transit from the solid to the liquid phase. This improvement is systematically studied as a function of the fin geometrical details ($l$, $h$), as well as the Rayleigh number $\operatorname{Ra}$ -- encoding the importance of buoyancy forces with respect to diffusion/dissipation effects -- and the Stefan number $\operatorname{St}$ -- encoding the importance of sensible heat with respect to latent heat. Overall, our systematic study in terms of the free parameters $l$, $h$, $\operatorname{Ra}$ and $\operatorname{St}$ offers inspiring insights to optimize the structure of a PCM cell during its manufacturing process and suggests optimal operating conditions for such geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>On the existence of fibered three-dimensional perfect fluid equilibria without continuous Euclidean symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.</description>
