      <title>How does course recommendation impact student outcomes? Examining directed self-placement with regression discontinuity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many students, placement into developmental education becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Placing college students into developmental education significantly negatively impacts student attainment, student probability of passing, and college credits earned. To combat these negative effects, many universities are investigating alternative placement mechanisms. Could directed self-placement be an effective alternative mechanism? Do students who self-place suffer the same negative impacts from placement recommendations as their traditionally placed counterparts? This paper uses longitudinal data with causal inference methods to examine whether directed self-placement has similar negative impacts on student grades and pass rates as mandatory placement schema. We begin with an analysis of over 20,000 student placement records into one of two different placement tracks for first-year writing. Longitudinal and institutional data allow us to control for characteristic variables such as student race, family income, and sex. The results of our regression discontinuity design show that directed self-placement does not negatively impact student grades or pass rate. This may be an improvement for students who place at or near the threshold for developmental/remedial education; However, class, race, and gender-based statistical differences persist in the program at-large, demonstrating that placement technique plays only one part in building a more equitable program.</description>

      <title>Who benefits the most? Direct and indirect effects of a free cesarean section policy in Benin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the causal effect of the access to Benin's free cesarean section policy on females and their children. I use a large sample of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for West African countries and analyze how the exemption of the cesarean section user fees for females in Benin directly impacts maternal and infant mortality, family size decisions, and labor market participation. I use a Difference in Differences approach and find that having access to the free cesarean section policy significantly reduces the number of stillbirths and infant mortality by 0.0855 (a 18.79 percentage change). Second, for the surviving children, I find that access to the free cesarean section increases the likelihood of maternal mortality by 0.00465 (a 5.21 percentage change). The policy is effective at reducing infant mortality and saving the newborn. However, it harms the mother's health which translates to lower fertility after the first birth and decreased maternal labor supply post-birth.</description>

      <title>Labor Market Reforms, Flexibility, and Employment Transitions Across Formal and Informal Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I investigate the 2017 labor market reform in Benin, which reduced firing costs and allowed firms to renew short-term contracts indefinitely. Using micro-data from the Harmonized Household Living Standards Surveys and a two-way fixed effect approach with nearby countries as the control group, I assess the reform's impact on employment, worker tenure, contract types, and wages. My empirical results reveal a 2.6 percentage point (24.5 percent) increase in formal sector employment and a 2.8 percentage point (3.2 percent) reduction in informal employment. Formal sector tenure decreased by 0.23 months for short-term contract workers, reflecting higher turnover, while long-term contract tenure increased by 0.15 months. The likelihood of securing a permanent contract rose by 23.2 percentage points (41.6 percent) in the formal sector, indicating that firms used long-term contracts to retain high-productivity workers. Wages in the formal sector increased by 33.6 USD per month on average, with workers on short-term contracts experiencing a wage increase of 19.6 USD and those on long-term contracts seeing an increase of 23.4 USD. I complement these findings with a theoretical job search model, which explains the mechanisms through which lowered firing costs affected firm hiring decisions, market tightness, and the sorting of workers across sectors. This study provides robust evidence of labor market reallocation and highlights the complex trade-offs between flexibility, employment stability, and wages in a developing country context.</description>

      <title>Gas price shocks, uncertainty and price setting: evidences from Italian firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how natural gas price shocks affect Italian firms' pricing decisions and inflation expectations using quarterly survey data from the Bank of Italy's Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations (SIGE) spanning 1999Q4-2025Q2. We identify natural gas price shocks through a Bayesian VAR with sign and zero restrictions. Our findings reveal that these shocks are a primary driver of firms' inflation expectations, particularly during the post-COVID period (2021-2023) when supply disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine generated unprecedented price pressures. We then estimate a larger BVAR incorporating firm-level price setting variables and macro aggregates, documenting that gas price shocks generate persistent increases in both firms' current and expected prices, alongside elevated inflation uncertainty. We uncover substantial non-linearities using state-dependent local projections: under high uncertainty, firms successfully pass through cost increases to consumers, maintaining elevated prices; under low uncertainty, recessionary effects dominate, causing firms to reduce prices below baseline.</description>

      <title>REMIND-PyPSA-Eur: Integrating power system flexibility into sector-coupled energy transition pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of low-cost renewable electricity combined with end-use electrification in transport, industry, and buildings offers a promising path to deep decarbonisation. However, aligning variable supply with demand requires strategies for daily and seasonal balancing. Existing models either lack the wide scope required for long-term transition pathways or the spatio-temporal detail to capture power system variability and flexibility. Here, we combine the complementary strengths of REMIND, a long-term integrated assessment model, and PyPSA-Eur, an hourly energy system model, through a bi-directional, price-based and iterative soft coupling. REMIND provides pathway variables such as sectoral electricity demand, installed capacities, and costs to PyPSA-Eur, which returns optimised operational variables such as capacity factors, storage requirements, and relative prices. After sufficient convergence, this integrated approach jointly optimises long-term investment and short-term operation. We demonstrate the coupling for two Germany-focused scenarios, with and without demand-side flexibility, reaching climate neutrality by 2045. Our results confirm that a sector-coupled energy system with nearly 100\% renewable electricity is technically possible and economically viable. Power system flexibility influences long-term pathways through price differentiation: supply-side market values vary by generation technology, while demand-side prices vary by end-use sector. Flexible electrolysers and smart-charging electric vehicles benefit from below-average prices, whereas less flexible heat pumps face almost twice the average price due to winter peak loads. Without demand-side flexibility, electricity prices increase across all end-users, though battery deployment partially compensates. Our approach therefore fully integrates power system dynamics into multi-decadal energy transition pathways.</description>

      <title>Predictive economics: Rethinking economic methodology with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes predictive economics as a distinct analytical perspective within economics, grounded in machine learning and centred on predictive accuracy rather than causal identification. Drawing on the instrumentalist tradition (Friedman), the explanation-prediction divide (Shmueli), and the contrast between modelling cultures (Breiman), we formalise prediction as a valid epistemological and methodological objective. Reviewing recent applications across economic subfields, we show how predictive models contribute to empirical analysis, particularly in complex or data-rich contexts. This perspective complements existing approaches and supports a more pluralistic methodology - one that values out-of-sample performance alongside interpretability and theoretical structure.</description>

      <title>Hidden Actions and Hidden Information in Peer Review: A Dynamic Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple model of the scientific peer review process, in which authors of varying ability invest to produce papers of varying quality, and journals evaluate papers based on a noisy signal, choosing to accept or reject each paper. We find that the first-best outcome is the limiting case as the evaluation technology is perfected, even though author type and effort are not known to the journal. Then, we consider the case where journals allow authors to challenge an initial rejection, and find that this approach to peer review yields an outcome closer to the first best relative to the approach that does not allow for such challenges.</description>

      <title>Downside Risk-Aware Equilibria for Strategic Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game theory has traditionally had a relatively limited view of risk based on how a player's expected reward is impacted by the uncertainty of the actions of other players. Recently, a new game-theoretic approach provides a more holistic view of risk also considering the reward-variance. However, these variance-based approaches measure variance of the reward on both the upside and downside. In many domains, such as finance, downside risk only is of key importance, as this represents the potential losses associated with a decision. In contrast, large upside "risk" (e.g. profits) are not an issue. To address this restrictive view of risk, we propose a novel solution concept, downside risk aware equilibria (DRAE) based on lower partial moments. DRAE restricts downside risk, while placing no restrictions on upside risk, and additionally, models higher-order risk preferences. We demonstrate the applicability of DRAE on several games, successfully finding equilibria which balance downside risk with expected reward, and prove the existence and optimality of this equilibria.</description>

      <title>Panel regression for the GDP of the Central and Eastern European countries using time-varying coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries into the European Economic Area serves as a valuable experiment for the regional economic development theory. The long-lasting convergence of these economies with more advanced Western Europe exhibits a few standard features and varying policies implemented. Even the Baltic countries, which started from very similar starting positions, demonstrate their unique trajectories of development. We employ a panel data regression model that allows coefficients to vary over time to compare the contributions of a few macroeconomic factors to the GDP growth of CEE countries. In particular, we regress the annual change of GDP per capita in PPP terms as a function of achieved GDP, price, trade, investment, and debt levels. Time-varying common slope coefficients in this approach describe the external economic environment in which countries implement their own policies. The panel consists of 11 Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia), which have been observed annually from 1995 to 2024. While the main selected factors of this investigation contribute to economic growth, in agreement with previous findings, the role of private debt appears vital in determining the pace of economic growth.</description>

      <title>A behavioral reinvestigation of the effect of long ties on social contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faced with uncertainty in decision making, individuals often turn to their social networks to inform their decisions. In consequence, these networks become central to how new products and behaviors spread. A key structural feature of networks is the presence of long ties, which connect individuals who share few mutual contacts. Under what conditions do long ties facilitate or hinder diffusion? The literature provides conflicting results, largely due to differing assumptions about individual decision-making. We reinvestigate the role of long ties by experimentally measuring adoption decisions under social influence for products with uncertain payoffs and embedding these decisions in network simulations. At the individual level, we find that higher payoff uncertainty increases the average reliance on social influence. However, personal traits such as risk preferences and attitudes toward uncertainty lead to substantial heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence. At the collective level, the observed individual heterogeneity ensures that long ties consistently promote diffusion, but their positive effect weakens as uncertainty increases. Our results reveal that the effect of long ties is not determined by whether the aggregate process is a simple or complex contagion, but by the extent of heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.09139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an infinitely repeated general-sum pricing game, independent reinforcement learners may exhibit collusive behavior without any communication, raising concerns about algorithmic collusion. To better understand the learning dynamics, we incorporate agents' relative performance (RP) among competitors using experience replay (ER) techniques. Experimental results indicate that RP considerations play a critical role in long-run outcomes. Agents that are averse to underperformance converge to the Bertrand-Nash equilibrium, while those more tolerant of underperformance tend to charge supra-competitive prices. This finding also helps mitigate the overfitting issue in independent Q-learning. Additionally, the impact of relative ER varies with the number of agents and the choice of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Attention vs Choice in Welfare Take-Up: What Works for WIC?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We decompose the causes of incomplete take-up of welfare program benefits into two latent mechanisms: inattention, where households do not consider program participation, and active choice, where households consider participation but find it not worthwhile. To capture these two mechanisms, we model households' take-up decision as a two-stage process: attention followed by choice. Our model allows covariates to influence both stages simultaneously, creating an identification challenge in quantifying covariates' impact on either stage separately. Exploiting two institutional structures of welfare programs: full attention among current participants and the recertification process, we prove that attention and choice parameters are constructively identifiable. Applied to National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) data on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), our model reveals substantial household-level heterogeneity in both attention and choice probabilities. Furthermore, counterfactual simulations predict that choice-nudging policies outperform attention-boosting policies. We test this prediction using data from a WIC pilot program in Vermont that sent choice-nudging and attention-boosting text messages to different households. Consistent with the counterfactual prediction, choice-nudging messages increased retention by eight to ten percentage points, while attention-boosting messages had statistically insignificant effects. Our results highlight the critical role of choice nudges in improving program take-up.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regulation and Investment Incentives in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine optimal regulation of financial networks with debt interdependencies between financial firms. We first show that firms often have an incentive to choose excessively risky portfolios and overly correlate their portfolios with those of their counterparties. We then characterize how optimal regulation depends on a firm's financial centrality and its available investment opportunities. In standard core-periphery networks, optimal regulation depends non-monotonically on the correlation of banks' investments, with maximal restrictions for intermediate levels of correlation. Moreover, it can be uniquely optimal to treat banks asymmetrically: restricting the investments of one core bank while allowing an otherwise identical core bank (in all aspects, including network centrality) to invest freely.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the decoy effect - specifically the attraction effect - can foster cooperation in social networks. In a lab experiment, we show that introducing a dominated option increases the selection of the target choice, especially in early decisions. The effect is stronger in individual settings but persists in networks despite free-riding incentives, with variation depending on the decision-maker's strategic position.</description>

      <title>Seeded Poisson Factorization: leveraging domain knowledge to fit topic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic models are widely used for discovering latent thematic structures in large text corpora, yet traditional unsupervised methods often struggle to align with pre-defined conceptual domains. This paper introduces seeded Poisson Factorization (SPF), a novel approach that extends the Poisson Factorization (PF) framework by incorporating domain knowledge through seed words. SPF enables a structured topic discovery by modifying the prior distribution of topic-specific term intensities, assigning higher initial rates to pre-defined seed words. The model is estimated using variational inference with stochastic gradient optimization, ensuring scalability to large datasets.
  We present in detail the results of applying SPF to an Amazon customer feedback dataset, leveraging pre-defined product categories as guiding structures. SPF achieves superior performance compared to alternative guided probabilistic topic models in terms of computational efficiency and classification performance. Robustness checks highlight SPF's ability to adaptively balance domain knowledge and data-driven topic discovery, even in case of imperfect seed word selection. Further applications of SPF to four additional benchmark datasets, where the corpus varies in size and the number of topics differs, demonstrate its general superior classification performance compared to the unseeded PF model.</description>

Abstract: Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential building operations is a crucial strategy for advancing China's net-zero ambitions. This study develops an advanced assessment framework that integrates static and dynamic modeling to evaluate emission pathways and carbon budgets for residential buildings at the provincial level. The framework provides a practical tool for generating robust carbon budget estimates with limited data, thereby enhancing its applicability for policy-oriented planning. Findings show that (1) in the business-as-usual scenario, the emissions for urban and rural residential buildings are projected to peak at 990 (+-0.7) and 450 (+-0.2) mega-tons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), respectively, with peak years occurring in 2031 (+-4.7) and 2026 (+-2.6). (2) In the decarbonization scenario, peak emissions decrease to 900 MtCO2 and 430 MtCO2 for urban and rural buildings, respectively. (3) The provinces with the highest emission reduction requirements are Henan (16.74 MtCO2), Xinjiang (12.59 MtCO2), Gansu (9.87 MtCO2), Hebei (8.46 MtCO2), and Guangdong (3.37 MtCO2), with Northwest China shouldering the greatest reduction responsibility, totaling 38.14 MtCO2. In conclusion, this study provides a dynamically optimized carbon budget assessment tool for residential buildings, offering valuable insights for government policy-making and playing a key role in facilitating the low-carbon transition of China's building sector during the pre-2030 planning period, ultimately contributing to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the building sector by mid-century.</description>
