      <title>A New Split Algorithm for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting models, as a novel explicit 3D representation, have been applied in many domains recently, such as explicit geometric editing and geometry generation. Progress has been rapid. However, due to their mixed scales and cluttered shapes, 3D Gaussian splatting models can produce a blurred or needle-like effect near the surface. At the same time, 3D Gaussian splatting models tend to flatten large untextured regions, yielding a very sparse point cloud. These problems are caused by the non-uniform nature of 3D Gaussian splatting models, so in this paper, we propose a new 3D Gaussian splitting algorithm, which can produce a more uniform and surface-bounded 3D Gaussian splatting model. Our algorithm splits an $N$-dimensional Gaussian into two N-dimensional Gaussians. It ensures consistency of mathematical characteristics and similarity of appearance, allowing resulting 3D Gaussian splatting models to be more uniform and a better fit to the underlying surface, and thus more suitable for explicit editing, point cloud extraction and other tasks. Meanwhile, our 3D Gaussian splitting approach has a very simple closed-form solution, making it readily applicable to any 3D Gaussian model.</description>

      <title>HeadEvolver: Text to Head Avatars via Locally Learnable Mesh Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HeadEvolver, a novel framework to generate stylized head avatars from text guidance. HeadEvolver uses locally learnable mesh deformation from a template head mesh, producing high-quality digital assets for detail-preserving editing and animation. To tackle the challenges of lacking fine-grained and semantic-aware local shape control in global deformation through Jacobians, we introduce a trainable parameter as a weighting factor for the Jacobian at each triangle to adaptively change local shapes while maintaining global correspondences and facial features. Moreover, to ensure the coherence of the resulting shape and appearance from different viewpoints, we use pretrained image diffusion models for differentiable rendering with regularization terms to refine the deformation under text guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate diverse head avatars with an articulated mesh that can be edited seamlessly in 3D graphics software, facilitating downstream applications such as more efficient animation with inherited blend shapes and semantic consistency.</description>

      <title>Faster Projected GAN: Towards Faster Few-Shot Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to solve the problems of long training time, large consumption of computing resources and huge parameter amount of GAN network in image generation, this paper proposes an improved GAN network model, which is named Faster Projected GAN, based on Projected GAN. The proposed network is mainly focuses on the improvement of generator of Projected GAN. By introducing depth separable convolution (DSC), the number of parameters of the Projected GAN is reduced, the training speed is accelerated, and memory is saved. Experimental results show that on ffhq-1k, art-painting, Landscape and other few-shot image datasets, a 20% speed increase and a 15% memory saving are achieved. At the same time, FID loss is less or no loss, and the amount of model parameters is better controlled. At the same time, significant training speed improvement has been achieved in the small sample image generation task of special scenes such as earthquake scenes with few public datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted our engagement with violence, sparking ethical deliberations regarding the algorithmic creation of violent imagery. This paper scrutinizes the "Gore Diffusion LoRA Model," an innovative AI model proficient in generating hyper-realistic visuals portraying intense violence and bloodshed. Our exploration encompasses the model's technical intricacies, plausible applications, and the ethical quandaries inherent in its utilization. We contend that the creation and implementation of such models warrant a meticulous discourse concerning the convergence of AI, art, and violence. Furthermore, we advocate for a structured framework advocating responsible development and ethical deployment of these potent technologies.</description>

      <title>VisionGPT-3D: A Generalized Multimodal Agent for Enhanced 3D Vision Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of text to visual components facilitates people's daily lives, such as generating image, videos from text and identifying the desired elements within the images. Computer vision models involving the multimodal abilities in the previous days are focused on image detection, classification based on well-defined objects. Large language models (LLMs) introduces the transformation from nature language to visual objects, which present the visual layout for text contexts. OpenAI GPT-4 has emerged as the pinnacle in LLMs, while the computer vision (CV) domain boasts a plethora of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and algorithms to convert 2D images to their 3D representations. However, the mismatching between the algorithms with the problem could lead to undesired results. In response to this challenge, we propose an unified VisionGPT-3D framework to consolidate the state-of-the-art vision models, thereby facilitating the development of vision-oriented AI. VisionGPT-3D provides a versatile multimodal framework building upon the strengths of multimodal foundation models. It seamlessly integrates various SOTA vision models and brings the automation in the selection of SOTA vision models, identifies the suitable 3D mesh creation algorithms corresponding to 2D depth maps analysis, generates optimal results based on diverse multimodal inputs such as text prompts.

      <title>pARam: Leveraging Parametric Design in Extended Reality to Support the Personalization of Artifacts for Personal Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) allows in-situ previewing of designs to be manufactured through Personal Fabrication (PF). These in-situ interactions exhibit advantages for PF, like incorporating the environment into the design process. However, design-for-fabrication in XR often happens through either highly complex 3D-modeling or is reduced to rudimentary adaptations of crowd-sourced models. We present pARam, a tool combining parametric designs (PDs) and XR, enabling in-situ configuration of artifacts for PF. In contrast to modeling- or search-focused approaches, pARam supports customization through embodied and practical inputs (e.g., gestures, recommendations) and evaluation (e.g., lighting estimation) without demanding complex 3D-modeling skills. We implemented pARam for HoloLens 2 and evaluated it (n=20), comparing XR and desktop conditions. Users succeeded in choosing context-related parameters and took their environment into account for their configuration using pARam. We reflect on the prospects and challenges of PDs in XR to streamline complex design methods for PF while retaining suitable expressivity.</description>

      <title>Controlling Text-to-Image Diffusion by Orthogonal Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large text-to-image diffusion models have impressive capabilities in generating photorealistic images from text prompts. How to effectively guide or control these powerful models to perform different downstream tasks becomes an important open problem. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a principled finetuning method -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT), for adapting text-to-image diffusion models to downstream tasks. Unlike existing methods, OFT can provably preserve hyperspherical energy which characterizes the pairwise neuron relationship on the unit hypersphere. We find that this property is crucial for preserving the semantic generation ability of text-to-image diffusion models. To improve finetuning stability, we further propose Constrained Orthogonal Finetuning (COFT) which imposes an additional radius constraint to the hypersphere. Specifically, we consider two important finetuning text-to-image tasks: subject-driven generation where the goal is to generate subject-specific images given a few images of a subject and a text prompt, and controllable generation where the goal is to enable the model to take in additional control signals. We empirically show that our OFT framework outperforms existing methods in generation quality and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>EucliDreamer: Fast and High-Quality Texturing for 3D Models with Stable Diffusion Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to generate textures for 3D models given text prompts and 3D meshes. Additional depth information is taken into account to perform the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) process with depth conditional Stable Diffusion. We ran our model over the open-source dataset Objaverse and conducted a user study to compare the results with those of various 3D texturing methods. We have shown that our model can generate more satisfactory results and produce various art styles for the same object. In addition, we achieved faster time when generating textures of comparable quality. We also conduct thorough ablation studies of how different factors may affect generation quality, including sampling steps, guidance scale, negative prompts, data augmentation, elevation range, and alternatives to SDS.</description>
