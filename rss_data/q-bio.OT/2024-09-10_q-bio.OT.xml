      <title>Advances in Nanoparticle-Based Targeted Drug Delivery Systems for Colorectal Cancer Therapy: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a significant global health burden, prompting the need for more effective and targeted therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising approach to address the limitations of conventional chemotherapy, offering enhanced specificity, reduced systemic toxicity, and improved therapeutic outcomes. This paper provides an in-depth review of the current advancements in the application of nanoparticles as vehicles for targeted drug delivery in CRC therapy. It covers a variety of nanoparticle types, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), with a focus on their design, functionalization, and mechanisms of action. This review also examines the challenges associated with the clinical translation of these technologies and explores future directions, emphasizing the potential of nanoparticle-based systems to revolutionize CRC treatment.</description>

      <title>Data-centric challenges with the application and adoption of artificial intelligence for drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is exhibiting tremendous potential to reduce the massive costs and long timescales of drug discovery. There are however important challenges currently limiting the impact and scope of AI models.
  Areas covered: In this perspective, the authors discuss a range of data issues (bias, inconsistency, skewness, irrelevance, small size, high dimensionality), how they challenge AI models, and which issue-specific mitigations have been effective. Next, they point out the challenges faced by uncertainty quantification techniques aimed at enhancing and trusting the predictions from these AI models. They also discuss how conceptual errors, unrealistic benchmarks and performance misestimation can confound the evaluation of models and thus their development. Lastly, the authors explain how human bias, whether from AI experts or drug discovery experts, constitutes another challenge that can be alleviated by gaining more prospective experience.
  Expert opinion: AI models are often developed to excel on retrospective benchmarks unlikely to anticipate their prospective performance. As a result, only a few of these models are ever reported to have prospective value (e.g. by discovering potent and innovative drug leads for a therapeutic target). The authors have discussed what can go wrong in practice with AI for drug discovery. We hope that this will help inform the decisions of editors, funders investors and researchers working in this area.</description>

      <title>Automated Chronotyping from a Daily Calendar using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chronotype compares individuals' circadian phase to others. It contextualizes mental health risk assessments and detection of social jet lag, which can hamper mental health and cognitive performance. Existing ways of determining chronotypes, such as Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) or the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), are limited by being discrete in time and time-intensive to update, meaning they rarely capture real-world variability across time. Chronotyping users based on a daily planner app might augment existing methods to enable assessment continuously and at scale. This paper reports the construction of a supervised binary classifier that attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. 1,460 registered users from the Owaves app opted in by filling out the MEQ survey between July 14, 2022, and May 1, 2023. 142 met the eligibility criteria. We used multimodal app data from individuals identified as morning and evening types from MEQ data, basing the classifier on app time series data. This included daily timing for 8 main lifestyle activity types: exercise, sleep, social interactions, meal times, relaxation, work, play, and miscellaneous, as defined in the app. The timing of activities showed substantial change across time, as well as heterogeneity by activity type. Our novel chronotyping classifier was able to predict the morningness and eveningness of its users with an ROC AUC of 0.70. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of chronotype classification from multimodal, real-world app data, while highlighting fundamental challenges to applying discrete and fixed labels to complex, dynamic, multimodal behaviors. Our findings suggest a potential for real-time monitoring of shifts in chronotype specific to different causes (i.e. types of activity), which could feasibly be used to support future, prospective mental health support research.</description>
