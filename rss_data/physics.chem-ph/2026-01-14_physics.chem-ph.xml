      <title>Accelerating Density Fitting with Adaptive-precision and 8-bit Integer on AI Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators like NVIDIA Tensor Cores offers new opportunities to speed up tensor-heavy scientific computations. However, applying them to quantum chemistry is challenging due to strict accuracy demands and irregular data patterns. We propose an adaptive precision algorithm to accelerate the density fitting (DF) method with Gaussian basis sets on AI accelerators using 8-bit integer (INT8) arithmetics. Implemented in the GPU-accelerated PySCF package, the algorithm is tested on more than twenty molecular systems with different NVIDIA GPUs. Compared to the standard FP64 code, our algorithm is up to 204\% faster on a RTX 4090 gaming GPU and up to 364\% faster on a RTX 6000 Ada workstation GPU without compromising the converged energy. This work demonstrates a practical approach to use AI hardware for reliable quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy and ASAP Analysis of Cyclopentadiene: The Vibrational Modes below 860 cm$^{-1}$ and the ${\nu}_{21}$ Mode at 961 cm$^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic fingerprints of vibrationally excited states of astronomical molecules are interesting for multiple reasons. They are excellent temperature probes of the corresponding astronomical regions and are thought to be the origin of many unknown lines in astronomical survey spectra. Rovibrational spectra provide accurate vibrational energies and can guide subsequent pure rotational studies. The Automated Spectral Assignment Procedure (ASAP) greatly simplifies the rovibrational analysis when the rotational spectrum of either the upper or lower vibrational state is known with a high degree of accuracy (e.g., from a rotational analysis). Here, we present a new implementation of ASAP for the analysis of cyclopentadiene, a cyclic pure hydrocarbon that has already been detected astronomically toward the cold core of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. Using the synchrotron radiation extracted by the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL facility, we recorded mid- and far-infrared high-resolution spectra of cyclopentadiene. We analyzed the rovibrational spectrum of the $\nu_{21}$ fundamental (961 cm$^{-1}$) with ASAP and used ASAP$^2$ to determine the vibrational energies of the eight vibrational modes below 860 cm$^{-1}$. ASAP$^2$ is an extension of ASAP for rovibrational bands where the rotational structures of the lower and upper states are known with high accuracy, leaving only the vibrational band center to be determined. The presented rovibrational fingerprints agree with the results from pure rotational spectroscopy, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of our new ASAP implementation.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Exciton and Exciton-Photon Annihilation in Polaritonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light--matter interactions forming hybrid quasiparticles termed polaritons can specifically tailor molecular photophysics. In this spirit, enhancing energy transport has recently been of special interest. Exciton--exciton annihilation is commonly used to quantify energy transfer in excitonic systems, and has been recently applied to investigate transport dynamics in polaritonic systems. However, the interpretation of experimental findings is challenging without a microscopic theory that accounts for the various nonradiative relaxation channels determining the quasiparticle diffusion length. In this work, we develop a microscopic model for polariton annihilation based on exciton--exciton annihilation and propose an exciton--photon annihilation as the decisive process that competes with exciton--exciton annihilation. The interplay between exciton--exciton and exciton--photon annihilation ultimately governs the annihilation dynamics and sets the fundamental limit to the transport efficiency. Our model explains recent experimental results and demonstrates that increased annihilation rates might serve as an explicit fingerprint to differentiate between the response of polaritons and other untargeted effects.</description>

      <title>Solvation Lies Within: Simulating Condensed-Phase Properties from Local Electronic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transitions between different environmental settings, a molecular system inevitably undergoes a range of detectable changes, and the ability to accurately simulate such responses, e.g., in the form of shifts to molecular energies, remains an important challenge across physical chemistry. Based on an exact decomposition of total energies from Kohn--Sham density functional theory in a basis of spatially localized molecular orbitals, the present work outlines a robust protocol for sampling the effect of solvation within homogeneous condensed phases by focusing on perturbations to local electronic structures only. We report chemically intuitive results for binding energies of water, ethanol, and acetonitrile that all display fast convergence with respect to the bulk size. Results stay largely invariant with respect to the choice of basis set while reflecting differences in density functional approximations, and our protocol thus allows for a physically sound and efficient estimation of general effects related to bulk solvation.</description>

      <title>A microscopic origin for the breakdown of the Stokes Einstein relation in ion transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion transport underlies the operation of biological ion channels and governs the performance of electrochemical energy-storage devices. A long-standing anomaly is that smaller alkali metal ions, such as Li$^+$, migrate more slowly in water than larger ions, in apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This breakdown is conventionally attributed to dielectric friction, a collective drag force arising from electrostatic interactions between a drifting ion and its surrounding solvent. Here, combining nanopore transport measurements over electric fields spanning several orders of magnitude with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the time-averaged electrostatic force on a migrating ion is not a drag force but a net driving force. By contrasting charged ions with neutral particles, we reveal that ionic charge introduces additional Lorentzian peaks in the frequency-dependent friction coefficient. These peaks originate predominantly from short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions within the first hydration layer and represent additional channels for energy dissipation, strongest for Li$^+$ and progressively weaker for Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions primarily act to tighten the local hydration structure, thereby amplifying short-range LJ interactions rather than directly opposing ion motion. This microscopic mechanism provides a unified physical explanation for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in aqueous ion transport.</description>

      <title>ChemXDyn: Dynamics-informed species and reaction detection methodology from atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of chemical species and reaction pathways from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories is a prerequisite for deriving predictive chemical-kinetic models and for mechanistic discovery in reactive systems. However, state-of-the-art trajectory analysis methods infer bonding from instantaneous distance thresholds, which can misclassify transient, nonreactive encounters as bonds and thereby introduce spurious intermediates, distorted reaction networks, and biased rate estimates. Here, we introduce ChemXDyn, a dynamics-aware computational methodology that leverages time-resolved interatomic distance signatures as a core principle to robustly identify chemically consistent bonded interactions and, consequently, extract meaningful reaction pathways. In particular, ChemXDyn propagates molecular connectivity through time while enforcing atomic valence and coordination constraints to distinguish genuine bond-breaking and bond-forming events from transient, nonreactive encounters. We evaluate ChemXDyn on ReaxFF MD simulations of hydrogen and ammonia oxidation and on neural-network potential MD simulations of methane oxidation, and benchmark its performance against widely used trajectory analysis methods. Across these cases, ChemXDyn suppresses unphysical species prevalent in static analyses, recovers experimentally consistent reaction pathways, and improves the fidelity of rate constant estimation. In ammonia oxidation, ChemXDyn removes unphysical intermediates and resolves key NOx- and N2O-forming and -consuming routes. In methane oxidation, it reconstructs the canonical progression from CH4 to CO2. By linking atomistic dynamics to chemically consistent reaction identification, ChemXDyn provides a transferable foundation for MD-derived reaction networks and kinetics, with potential utility spanning combustion, catalysis, plasma chemistry, and electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted phonon formalism within density functional perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles framework for the calculation of phonons in nanostructures with cyclic and/or helical symmetry. In particular, we derive a cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted representation of the dynamical matrix at arbitrary phonon wavevectors within a variationally formulated, symmetry-adapted density functional perturbation theory framework. In so doing, we also derive the acoustic sum rules for cylindrical geometries, which include a rigid-body rotational mode in addition to the three translational modes. We implement the cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted formalism within a high-order finite-difference discretization. Using carbon nanotubes as representative systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the framework through excellent agreement with periodic plane-wave results. We further apply the framework to compute the Young's and shear moduli of carbon nanotubes, as well as the scaling laws governing the dependence of ring and radial breathing mode phonon frequencies on nanotube diameter. The elastic moduli are found to be in agreement with previous density functional theory and experimental results, while the phonon scaling laws show qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian umbrella quadrature accelerates free-energy calculations across diverse molecular systems and processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biased sampling in molecular dynamics simulations overcomes timescale limitations and delivers free-energy landscapes, essential to understand complex atomistic phenomena. However, when applied across diverse systems and processes, biasing protocols often require time- and resource-consuming fine-tuning. In search for robustness, we boost a prominent biasing method, Umbrella Sampling. To estimate the value of an integral, i.e., the free energy, our Bayesian Umbrella Quadrature (BUQ) method iteratively selects gradient samples, i.e., bias locations, that most reduce the posterior integral variance based on a noise-tolerant Gaussian process model, which also effectively interpolates between samples. We validate the method for a conformational change in a small peptide, a water-to-ice phase transition, and a substitution chemical reaction; obtaining excellent accuracies and speedups. To ease adoption of this more automated and universal free-energy method, we interface BUQ with wide-spread simulation packages and share hyperparametrization guidelines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between a pair of colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In solution, electrically like-charged particles can experience a strong and long-ranged attraction that leads to the formation of stable, slowly reorganizing clusters. The attractive force underpinning this spontaneous organization process has been shown to depend on both the sign of charge of the particle and the nature of the solvent medium. The origin of the attraction has been ascribed to the preferential orientation of solvent molecules at the object-electrolyte interface. Here, we use optical imaging to directly measure the spatial profile of the potential of mean force between isolated pairs of charged microspheres. Working with particles carrying a variety of surface chemistries we find that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. In particular we show that particles carrying strongly anionic surface coatings composed of DNA or phospholipid bilayers display long-range attraction. We further find that the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force can depend on the properties of the interacting particles. This contrasts with the canonical expectation that the screening length governing the interaction of charged particles in solution depends exclusively on the properties of the intervening electrolyte medium. The observations point to significant departures from current thinking, and the likely need for a model of interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations. Finally, a strong and long-ranged attraction mediated by anionic matter constituting lipid membranes and chromatin could carry far-reaching implications for biological organization and structure formation.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Bloch's Theorem beyond the Long-Wavelength Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a powerful tool to manipulate material properties, yet it remains a matter of debate whether and how quantized fields affect the periodicity of crystals. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under strong light-matter coupling, revealing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We introduce a general framework to incorporate multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way, showing that additional modes contribute small energy corrections noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation, these contributions reduce to a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal plane, providing a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. Together, these results establish a rigorous framework for describing polaritonic states in crystalline solids.</description>
