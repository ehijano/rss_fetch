      <title>Complexified tetrahedrons, fundamental groups, and volume conjecture for double twist knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the volume conjecture for double twist knots are proved. The main tool is the complexified tetrahedron and the associated $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ representation of the fundamental group. A complexified tetrahedron is a version of a truncated or a doubly truncated tetrahedron whose edge lengths and the dihedral angles are complexified. The colored Jones polynomial is expressed in terms of the quantum $6j$ symbol, which corresponds to the complexified tetrahedron.</description>

      <title>Recognising perfect fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pseudo-Anosov flow is said to have perfect fits if there are stable and unstable leaves that are asymptotic in the universal cover. We give an algorithm to decide, given a box decomposition of a pseudo-Anosov flow, if the flow has perfect fits. As a corollary, we obtain an algorithm to decide whether two flows without perfect fits are orbit equivalent.</description>

      <title>On the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture (and prove for once-punctured torus bundles) that the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of a punctured surface at roots of unity coincide with the 1-loop invariant of their mapping torus at roots of unity. This explains the topological invariance of the BWY invariants and how their volume conjecture, to all orders, and with exponentially small terms included, follows from the quantum modularity conjecture. Using the numerical methods of Zagier and the first author, we illustrate how to efficiently compute the invariants and their asymptotics to arbitrary order in perturbation theory, using as examples the $LR$ and the $LLR$ pseudo-Anosov monodromies of the once-punctured torus. Finally, we introduce descendant versions of the 1-loop and BWY invariants and conjecture (and numerically check for pseudo-Anosov monodromies of $L/R$-length at most 5) that they are related by a Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-representations and odd-th cyclic covers of genus one two-bridge knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $K$ a genus one two-bridge knot. We prove that if $p$ divides the size of the 1st homology group of some odd-th cyclic branched cover of the knot $K$, then its group $\pi_1(S^3-K)$ admits a liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-character. In addition, we discuss the existence of liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-representations. In the course of the argument, we also point out a constraint for prime numbers dividing certain Lucas-type sequences by using the Legendre symbols.</description>

      <title>From planar to annular to toroidal bracket polynomials for pseudo knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo links are equivalence classes under Reidemeister-type moves of link diagrams containing crossings with undefined over and under information. In this paper, we extend the Kauffman bracket and Jones polynomials from planar pseudo links to pseudo links in the annulus and in the torus, and their respective lifts from the three-space to the solid torus and the thickened torus. Moreover, since annular and toroidal pseudo links can be represented as mixed links in the three-sphere, we also introduce the respective Kauffman bracket and Jones polynomials for their planar mixed link diagrams. Our work provides new tools for the study of annular and toroidal pseudo links.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of HCMU surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HCMU surfaces are compact Riemann surfaces equipped with an extremal K\"{a}hler metric and a finite number of singularities. Research on these surfaces was initiated by E. Calabi and X.-X. Chen over thirty years ago. We provide a detailed description of the geometric structure of HCMU surfaces, building on the classical football decomposition introduced by Chen-Chen-Wu. From this perspective, most HCMU surfaces can be uniquely described by a set of data that includes both discrete topological information and continuous geometric parameters. This data representation is effective for studying the moduli space of HCMU surfaces with specified genus and conical angles, suggesting a topological approach to this topic. As a first application, we present a unified proof of the angle constraints on HCMU surfaces. Using the same approach, we establish an existence theorem for HCMU surfaces of any genus with a single conical point, which is also a saddle point. Finally, we determine the dimension of the moduli space, defined as the number of independent continuous parameters. This is achieved by examining several geometric deformations of HCMU surfaces and the various relationships between the quantities in the data set representation.</description>

      <title>L-spaces and knot traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a great deal of interest in understanding which knots are characterized by which of their Dehn surgeries. We study a 4-dimensional version of this question: which knots are determined by which of their traces? We prove several results that are in stark contrast with what is known about characterizing surgeries, most notably that the 0-trace detects every L-space knot. Our proof combines tools in Heegaard Floer homology with results about surface homeomorphisms and their dynamics. We also consider nonzero traces, proving for instance that each positive torus knot is determined by its $n$-trace for any $n\leq 0$, whereas no non-positive integer is known to be a characterizing slope for any positive torus knot besides the right-handed trefoil.</description>

Abstract: Alternative proof is given for an earlier presented result that if a link in 3-space bounds a proper oriented surface (without closed component) in the upper half 4-space, then the link bounds a proper oriented ribbon surface in the upper half 4-space which is a renewal embedding of the original surface.</description>

      <title>An unoriented skein exact triangle in unoriented link Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define band maps in unoriented link Floer homology and show that they form an unoriented skein exact triangle. These band maps are similar to the band maps in equivariant Khovanov homology given by the Lee deformation.
  As a key tool, we use a Heegaard Floer analogue of Bhat's recent 2-surgery exact triangle in instanton Floer homology, which may be of independent interest. Unoriented knot Floer homology corresponds to $I^{\sharp}$ of the knot in our 2-surgery exact triangle.</description>

      <title>Positive Scalar Curvature and Exotic Structures on Simply Connected Four Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address Gromov's band width inequality and Rosenberg's $S^1$-stability conjecture for simply connected smooth four-manifolds. Both results are known to be false in dimension 4 due to counterexamples based on Seiberg-Witten invariants. Nevertheless, we show that both of these results hold upon considering smooth four-manifolds up to homeomorphism. The key technical innovation is a careful adaptation of ideas from high-dimensional surgery theory to dimension 4.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Solutions of the Haydys-Witten Equations and Symplectic Khovanov Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An influential conjecture by Witten states that there is an instanton Floer homology of four-manifolds with corners that in certain situations is isomorphic to Khovanov homology of a given knot $K$. The Floer chain complex is generated by Nahm pole solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$ with an additional monopole-like singular behaviour along the knot $K$ inside the three-dimensional boundary at $y=0$. The Floer differential is given by counting solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between Kapustin-Witten solutions along an additional flow direction $\mathbb{R}_s$. This article investigates solutions of a decoupled version of the Kapustin-Witten and Haydys-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}_s \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$, which in contrast to the full equations exhibit a Hermitian Yang-Mills structure and can be viewed as a lift of the extended Bogomolny equations (EBE) from three to five dimensions. Inspired by Gaiotto-Witten's approach of adiabatically braiding EBE-solutions to obtain generators of the Floer homology, we propose that there is an equivalence between adiabatic solutions of the decoupled Haydys-Witten equations and non-vertical paths in the moduli space of EBE-solutions fibered over the space of monopole positions. Moreover, we argue that the Grothendieck-Springer resolution of the Lie algebra of the gauge group provides a finite-dimensional model of this moduli space of monopole solutions. These considerations suggest an intriguing similarity between Haydys-Witten instanton Floer homology and symplectic Khovanov homology and provide a novel approach towards a proof of Witten's gauge-theoretic interpretations of Khovanov homology.</description>

Abstract: For a closed and orientable surface of genus at least 2, we prove the surface group extensions of the stabilizers of multicurves are hierarchically hyperbolic groups. This answers a question of Durham, Dowdall, Leininger, and Sisto. We also include an appendix that employs work of Charney, Cordes, and Sisto to characterize the Morse boundaries of hierarchically hyperbolic groups whose largest acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space is on a quasi-tree.</description>

      <title>On The Cost Function Associated With Legendrian Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a non-negative integer-valued function that measures the obstruction for converting topological isotopy between two Legendrian knots into a Legendrian isotopy. We refer to this function as the Cost function. We show that the Cost function induces a metric on the set of topologically isotopic Legendrian knots. Hence, the set of topologically isotopic Legendrian knots can be seen as a graph with path-metric given by the Cost function. Legendrian simple knot types are shown to be characterized using the Cost function. We also get a quantitative version of Fuchs-Tabachnikov's Theorem that says any two Legendrian knots in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{std})$ in the same topological knot type become Legendrian isotopic after sufficiently many stabilizations. We compute the Cost function for Legendrian simple knots (for example torus knots) and we note the behavior of Cost function for twist knots and cables of torus knots (some of which are Legendrian non-simple). We also construct examples of Legendrian representatives of 2-bridge knots and compute the Cost between them. Further, we investigate the behavior of the Cost function under the connect sum operation. We conclude with some questions about the Cost function, its relation with the standard contact structure, and the topological knot type.</description>

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new smooth version of a CW complex named a fat CW complex, and to show that it includes all closed manifolds, because existing smooth versions of CW complexes (e.g. [Iwa22]) do not have such property. We also verify that de Rham theorem holds for a fat CW complex and that a regular CW complex is reflexive in the sense of Y. Karshon, J. Watts and P. I-Zemmour. Further, any topological CW complex is topologically homotopy equivalent to a fat CW complex. So, a fat CW complex enjoys many nice properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15617v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Links-Gould invariant of links $LG^{2,1}$ is a two-variable generalization of the Alexander-Conway polynomial. Using representation theory of $U_{q}\mathfrak{gl}(2 \vert 1)$, we prove that the degree of the Links-Gould polynomial provides a lower bound on the Seifert genus of any knot, therefore improving the bound known as the Seifert inequality in the case of the Alexander invariant. One practical consequence of this new genus bound is a straightforward proof of the fact that the Kinoshita-Terasaka and Conway knots have genus greater or equal to 2.</description>

Abstract: Kreck and Schafer produced the first examples of stably diffeomorphic closed smooth 4-manifolds which are not homotopy equivalent. They were constructed by applying the doubling construction to 2-complexes over certain finite abelian groups of odd order. By extending their methods, we formulate a new homotopy invariant on the class of 4-manifolds arising as doubles of 2-complexes with finite fundamental group. As an application we show that, for any $k \ge 2$, there exist a family of $k$ closed smooth 4-manifolds which are all stably diffeomorphic but are pairwise not homotopy equivalent.</description>

Abstract: Let $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. Let $\cal DFR$ be the space of discrete faithful representations of the modular group into ${\rm Isom\/}(X)$ which map the order $2$ generator to an isometry with a unique fixed point. I prove many things about the component $\cal B$ of $\cal DFR$ known as the Barbot component: It is homeomorphic to $\R^2 \times [0,\infty)$. The boundary parametrizes the Pappus representations from [{\bf S0\/}]. The interior parametrizes the complete extension of the family of Anosov representations from [{\bf BLV\/}]. The members of $\cal B$ are isometry groups of embedded patterns of geodesics in $X$ which have asymptotic properties like the edges of the Farey triangulation or shears thereof. The Anosov representations are obtained from the Pappus representations by either of two shearing operations in $X$. The shearing structure is encoded by two proper foliations of $\cal B$ into rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a 3 dimensional contact geometric characterization of Anosov 3-flows based on interactions with Reeb dynamics. We investigate basic properties of the space of the resulting geometries. A technical theorem on asymptotic synchronization of adapted norms is proved, which can be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>The canonical lamination calibrated by a cohomology class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $d$, and let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ have unit norm. We construct a lamination $\lambda_\rho$ whose leaves are exactly the minimal hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every calibration in $\rho$. The geometry of $\lambda_\rho$ is closely related to the the geometry of the unit ball of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$, and so we deduce several results constraining the geometry of the stable norm ball in terms of the topology of $M$. These results establish a close analogy between the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ and the earthquake norm on the tangent space to Teichm\"uller space.</description>
