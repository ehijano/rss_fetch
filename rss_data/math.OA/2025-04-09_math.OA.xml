      <title>Duality for operator systems with generating cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a complete operator system with a generating cone; i.e. $S_\sa = S_+ - S_+$. We show that there is a matrix norm on the dual space $S^*$, under which, and the usual dual matrix cone, $S^*$ becomes a dual operator system with a generating cone, denoted by $S^\rd$. The canonical complete order isomorphism $\iota_{S^*}: S^* \to S^\rd$ is a dual Banach space isomorphism. Furthermore, we construct a canonical completely contractive weak$^*$-homeomorphism $\beta_S: (S^\rd)^\rd\to S^{**}$, and verify that it is a complete order isomorphism.
  For a complete operator system $T$ with a generating cone and a completely positive complete contraction $\varphi:S\to T$, there is a weak$^*$-continuous completely positive complete contraction $\varphi^\rd:T^\rd \to S^\rd$ with $\iota_{S^*}\circ \varphi^* = \varphi^\rd \circ \iota_{T^*}$. This produces a faithful functor from the category of complete operator systems with generating cones (where morphisms are completely positive complete contractions) to the category of dual operator systems with generating cones (where morphisms are weak$^*$-continuous completely positive complete contractions).
  We define the notion of approximately unital operator systems, and verify that operator systems considered in \cite{CvS} and \cite{CvS2} are approximately unital. If $S$ is approximately unital, then $\iota_{S^*}:S^* \to S^\rd$ is an operator space isomorphism and $\beta_S: (S^\rd)^\rd\to S^{**}$ is a complete isometry. We will also establish that the restriction of the faithful functor $(S,T,\varphi)\mapsto (T^\rd, S^\rd, \varphi^\rd)$ to the category of approximately unital complete operator systems is both full and injective on objects.</description>

      <title>von Neumann Subfactors and Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the language of von Neumann subfactors to investigate non-invertible symmetries in two dimensions. A fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$, its module category $\mathcal{M}$, and a gauging labeled by an algebra object $\mathcal{A}$ are encoded in the bipartite principal graph of a subfactor. The dual principal graph captures the quantum symmetry $\mathcal{C}'$ obtained by gauging $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, as well as a reverse gauging back to $\mathcal{C}$. From a given subfactor $N \subset M$, we derive a quiver diagram that encodes the representations of the associated non-invertible symmetry. We show how this framework provides necessary conditions for admissible gaugings, enabling the construction of generalized orbifold groupoids. To illustrate this strategy, we present three examples: Rep$(D_4)$ as a warm-up, the higher-multiplicity case Rep$(A_4)$ with its associated generalized orbifold groupoid and triality symmetry, and Rep$(A_5)$, where $A_5$ is the smallest non-solvable finite group. For applications to gapless systems, we embed these generalized gaugings as global manipulations on the conformal manifolds of $c=1$ CFTs and uncover new self-dualities in the exceptional $SU(2)_1/A_5$ theory. For $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric TQFTs, we use the subfactor-derived quiver diagrams to characterize gapped phases, describe their vacuum structure, and classify the recently proposed particle-soliton degeneracies.</description>

      <title>On the structure of DHR bimodules of abstract spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract spin chains axiomatize the structure of local observables on the 1D lattice which are invariant under a global symmetry, and arise at the physical boundary of 2+1D topologically ordered spin systems. In this paper, we study tensor categorical properties of DHR bimodules over abstract spin chains. Assuming that the charge transporters generate the algebra of observables, we prove that the associated category has a structure of modular tensor category with respect to the natural braiding. Under an additional assumption of algebraic Haag duality, this category becomes the Drinfeld center of the half-line fusion category.</description>

      <title>Factorizing Defects from Generalized Pinning Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalized pinning fields in conformal field theory that model a large class of critical impurities at large distance, enriching the familiar universality classes. We provide a rigorous definition of such defects as certain unbounded operators on the Hilbert space and prove that when inserted on codimension-one surfaces they factorize the spacetime into two halves. The factorization channels are further constrained by symmetries in the bulk. As a corollary, we solve such critical impurities in the 2d minimal models and establish the factorization phenomena previously observed for localized mass deformations in the 3d ${\rm O}(N)$ model.</description>

      <title>Trace-class operators on Hilbert modules and Haagerup tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the space of trace-class operators on a Hilbert module over a commutative C*-algebra, as defined and studied in earlier work of Stern and van Suijlekom (Journal of Functional Analysis, 2021), is completely isometrically isomorphic to a Haagerup tensor product of the module with its operator-theoretic adjoint. This generalises a well-known property of Hilbert spaces. In the course of proving this, we also obtain a new proof of a result of Stern-van Suijlekom concerning the equivalence between two definitions of trace-class operators on Hilbert modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.10261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply Wermuth's theorem on commuting operator exponentials to show that if $A, B \in B(X)$, $X$ being Banach space and $A$ of $2\pi i$-congruence free spectrum, then $e^A B = B e^A$ if and only if $AB=BA$. We employ this observation to provide alternative proof of similar result by Chaban and Mortad, applicable for $X$ being a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Random harmonic maps into spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a punctured Riemann surface with Euler characteristic $\chi(S)&lt;0$. For any unitary representation $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, we introduce its renormalized energy and its harmonic representatives, which are equivariant harmonic maps from the universal cover of $S$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Our main result is that if a sequence of unitary representations $\rho_j$ strongly converges, then their renormalized energies converge to $\frac{\pi}{4}|\chi(S)|$ and the shape of their harmonic representatives converges to a unique rescaled hyperbolic metric. Combining this statement with examples of strongly converging representations provided by random matrix theory, we derive the following applications.
  (1) If $\pi_1(S)$ is a free group, then for a random $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, the shape of its harmonic representatives concentrates around a rescaled hyperbolic metric with high probability as $N\to \infty$.
  (2) For any closed hyperbolic surface, a finite covering admits a harmonic immersion into some Euclidean unit sphere, which is almost isometric after rescaling.
  (3) There are closed, branched, minimal surfaces $\mathfrak{S}_j$ in some Euclidean unit spheres such that $\mathfrak{S}_j$ Benjamini-Schramm converges to a rescaled hyperbolic plane as $j\to \infty$, and the Gaussian curvature $K_j$ of $\mathfrak{S}_j$ satisfies $\lim_{j\to \infty} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Area}(\mathfrak{S}_j)}\int_{\mathfrak{S}_j} |K_j+8|=0.$</description>

      <title>The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the $\textit{large-scale structure of entanglement}$ of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.</description>
