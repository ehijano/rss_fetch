      <title>On the Constructive Theory of Jordan Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a definition of Jordan curve similar to that of Dieudonn\'e, we prove that our notion is equivalent to that used by Berg et al. in their constructive proof of the Jordan Curve Theorem. We then establish a number of properties of Jordan curves and their corresponding index functions, including the important Proposition 32 and its corollaries about lines crossing a Jordan curve at a smooth point. The final section is dedicated to proving that the index of a point with respect to a piecewise smooth Jordan curve in the complex plane is identical to the familiar winding number of the curve around that point. The paper is written within the framework of Bishop's constructive analysis. Although the work in Sections 3--5 is almost entirely new, the paper contains a substantial amount of expository material for the benefit of the reader.</description>

      <title>Model Theory of Homogeneous D-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore several model-theoretic aspects of D-sets, which were studied in detail by Adeleke and Neumann. We characterize ultrahomogeneity in the class of colored D-sets and classify unbounded order-indiscernible sequences in such structures. We use these results to provide a characterization of distal colored D-sets and prove that all colored D-sets with quantifier elimination are dp-minimal.</description>

      <title>Weak variations of Baumgartner's axiom for Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $X$ is a topological space and $\kappa$ is a cardinal then $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ is the statement that for each pair $A, B \subseteq X$ of $\kappa$-dense subsets there is an autohomeomorphism $h:X \to X$ mapping $A$ to $B$. In particular $\mathsf{BA}_{\aleph_1} (\mathbb R)$ is equivalent the celebrated Baumgartner axiom on isomorphism types of $\aleph_1$-dense linear orders. In this paper we consider two natural weakenings of $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ which we call $\mathsf{BA}^-_\kappa (X)$ and $\mathsf{U}_\kappa (X)$ for arbitrary perfect Polish spaces $X$. We show that the first of these, though properly weaker, entails many of the more striking consequences of $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ while the second does not. Nevertheless the second is still independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and we show in particular that it fails in the Cohen and random models. This motivates several new classes of pairs of spaces which are ``very far from being homeomorphic" which we call ``disliking", ``hating", and ``loathing". The paper concludes by studying these classes, particularly in the context of forcing theory, in an attempt to gauge how different weak Baumgartner axioms may be separated.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Higson coronas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under mild set theoretic hypotheses we have rigidity for algebras of continuous functions over Higson coronas, topological spaces arising in coarse geometry. In particular, we show that under $\mathsf{OCA}$ and $\mathsf {MA}_{\aleph_1}$, if two uniformly locally finite metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ have homeomorphic Higson coronas $\nu X$ and $\nu Y$, then $X$ and $Y$ are coarsely equivalent, a statement which provably does not follow from $\mathsf{ZFC}$ alone.</description>

      <title>Hennessy-Milner Type Theorems for Fuzzy Multimodal Logics Over Heyting Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we have introduced two types of fuzzy simulations (forward and backward) and five types of fuzzy bisimulations (forward, backward, forward-backward, backward-forward and regular) between Kripke models for the fuzzy multimodal logics over a complete linearly ordered Heyting algebra. In this paper, for a given non-empty set $\Psi $ of modal formulae, we introduce the concept of a weak bisimulation between Kripke models. This concept can be used to express the degree of equality of fuzzy sets of formulae from $\Psi $ that are valid in two worlds $w$ and $w'$, that is, to express the degree of modal equivalence between worlds $w$ and $w'$ with respect to the formulae from $\Psi$. We prove several Hennessy-Milner type theorems. The first theorem determines that the greatest weak bisimulation for the set of plus-formulae between image-finite Kripke models coincides with the greatest forward bisimulation. The second theorem determines that the greatest weak bisimulation for the set of minus-formulae between domain-finite Kripke models coincides with the greatest backward bisimulation. Finally, the third theorem determines that the greatest weak bisimulation for the set of all modal formulae between the degree-finite Kripke models coincides with the greatest regular bisimulation.</description>

      <title>A Logical Formalisation of a Hypothesis in Weighted Abduction: towards User-Feedback Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted abduction computes hypotheses that explain input observations. A reasoner of weighted abduction first generates possible hypotheses and then selects the hypothesis that is the most plausible. Since a reasoner employs parameters, called weights, that control its plausibility evaluation function, it can output the most plausible hypothesis according to a specific application using application-specific weights. This versatility makes it applicable from plant operation to cybersecurity or discourse analysis. However, the predetermined application-specific weights are not applicable to all cases of the application. Hence, the hypothesis selected by the reasoner does not necessarily seem the most plausible to the user. In order to resolve this problem, this article proposes two types of user-feedback dialogue protocols, in which the user points out, either positively, negatively or neutrally, properties of the hypotheses presented by the reasoner, and the reasoner regenerates hypotheses that satisfy the user's feedback. As it is required for user-feedback dialogue protocols, we then prove: (i) our protocols necessarily terminate under certain reasonable conditions; (ii) they achieve hypotheses that have the same properties in common as fixed target hypotheses do in common if the user determines the positivity, negativity or neutrality of each pointed-out property based on whether the target hypotheses have that property.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimensions and profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a finitely branching rooted tree such that any node has at least two successors. The path space $[T]$ is an ultrametric space where the distance of distinct paths $f,g$ is $1/|T_n|$, with $T_n$ denoting the set of nodes at distance $n$ from the root. Let $S$ be a subtree of $T$ without leaves that is level-wise uniformly branching, in the sense that the number of successors of a node only depends on its distance from the root. We show that the Hausdorff and lower box dimensions coincide for~$[S]$, and the packing and upper box dimensions also coincide. We give geometric proofs, as well as proofs based on the point to set principles. We use the first result to reprove a result of Barnea and Shalev on the dimension of closed subgroups of a profinite group $G$, referring only on the geometric structure of the closed subgroup in the canonical path space given by an inverse system for $G$.</description>

Abstract: Using iterated Sacks forcing and topological games, we prove that the existence of a totally imperfect Menger set in the Cantor cube with cardinality continuum is independent from ZFC. We also analyze the structure of Hurewicz and consonant subsets of the Cantor cube in the Sacks model.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of positive branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06673v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively.
  The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas.
  Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</description>
