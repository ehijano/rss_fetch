      <title>Network and interaction models for data with hierarchical granularity via fragmentation and coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nested family of Bayesian nonparametric models for network and interaction data with a hierarchical granularity structure that naturally arises through finer and coarser population labelings. In the case of network data, the structure is easily visualized by merging and shattering vertices, while respecting the edge structure. We further develop Bayesian inference procedures for the model family, and apply them to synthetic and real data. The family provides a connection of practical and theoretical interest between the Hollywood model of Crane and Dempsey, and the generalized-gamma graphex model of Caron and Fox. A key ingredient for the construction of the family is fragmentation and coagulation duality for integer partitions, and for this we develop novel duality relations that generalize those of Pitman and Dong, Goldschmidt and Martin. The duality is also crucially used in our inferential procedures.</description>

      <title>Functional Sieve Bootstrap for the Partial Sum Process with Application to Change-Point Detection without Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change-points in functional time series can be detected using the CUSUM-statistic, which is a non-linear functional of the partial sum process. Various methods have been proposed to obtain critical values for this statistic. In this paper we use the functional autoregressive sieve bootstrap to imitate the behavior of the partial sum process and we show that this procedure asymptotically correct estimates critical values under the null hypothesis. We also establish the consistency of the corresponding bootstrap based test under local alternatives. The finite sample performance of the procedure is studied via simulations under the null -hypothesis and under the alternative.</description>

      <title>Identification of the parameters of complex constitutive models: Least squares minimization vs. Bayesian updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study the common least-squares minimization approach is compared to the Bayesian updating procedure. In the content of material parameter identification the posterior parameter density function is obtained from its prior and the likelihood function of the measurements. By using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \cite{Hastings1970}, the global density function including local peaks can be computed. Thus this procedure enables an accurate evaluation of the global parameter quality. However, the computational effort is remarkable larger compared to the minimization approach. Thus several methodologies for an efficient approximation of the likelihood function are discussed in the present study.</description>

      <title>Variance-based sensitivity analysis in the presence of correlated input variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an extension of the classical Sobol' estimator for the estimation of variance based sensitivity indices. The approach assumes a linear correlation model between the input variables which is used to decompose the contribution of an input variable into a correlated and an uncorrelated part. This method provides sampling matrices following the original joint probability distribution which are used directly to compute the model output without any assumptions or approximations of the model response function.</description>

      <title>Graph Matching via convex relaxation to the simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Graph Matching problem, which consists of finding the best possible alignment between two input graphs, and has many applications in computer vision, network deanonymization and protein alignment. A common approach to tackle this problem is through convex relaxations of the NP-hard \emph{Quadratic Assignment Problem} (QAP).
  Here, we introduce a new convex relaxation onto the unit simplex and develop an efficient mirror descent scheme with closed-form iterations for solving this problem. Under the correlated Gaussian Wigner model, we show that the simplex relaxation admits a unique solution with high probability. In the noiseless case, this is shown to imply exact recovery of the ground truth permutation. Additionally, we establish a novel sufficiency condition for the input matrix in standard greedy rounding methods, which is less restrictive than the commonly used `diagonal dominance' condition. We use this condition to show exact one-step recovery of the ground truth (holding almost surely) via the mirror descent scheme, in the noiseless setting. We also use this condition to obtain significantly improved conditions for the GRAMPA algorithm [Fan et al. 2019] in the noiseless setting.</description>

      <title>When Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived - somewhat naively - as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands. Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics - that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases - with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests. Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by a class of weighted linear statistics.</description>
