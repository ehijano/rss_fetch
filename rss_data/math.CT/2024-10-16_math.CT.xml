      <title>Logical Structure on Inverse Functor Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work on the categorical semantics of dependent type theories, we investigate the following question: When is logical structure (crucially, dependent-product and subobject-classifier structure) induced from a category to categories of diagrams in it? Our work offers several answers, providing a variety of conditions on both the category itself and the indexing category of diagrams. Additionally, motivated by homotopical considerations, we investigate the case when the indexing category is equipped with a class of weak equivalences and study conditions under which the localization map induces a structure-preserving functor between presheaf categories.</description>

      <title>Odd Khovanov homology, higher representation theory and higher rewriting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is devoted to the fields of quantum topology and rewriting theory, and their surprising interconnections. In the first part of the thesis, we develop a higher representation theoretic approach to odd Khovanov homology; this is the content of arXiv:2311.14394. One of the essential ingredients is a certain graded-2-category of graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. In the second part of the thesis, we develop a rewriting theory suitable for higher algebras and their super or graded analogues, and use it to show a basis theorem for graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. These techniques have the potential to be applied to a wide variety of contexts. Both parts of the thesis can be read independently. Each has its own comprehensive introduction, allowing experts from one field to get acquainted with the other field.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>

      <title>Algebras for enriched $\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.10042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the description of enriched $\infty$-operads as associative algebras in symmetric sequences, we define algebras for enriched $\infty$-operads as certain modules in symmetric sequences. For $\mathbf{V}$ a symmetric monoidal model category and $\mathbf{O}$ a $\Sigma$-cofibrant operad in $\mathbf{V}$ for which the model structure on $\mathbf{V}$ can be lifted to one on $\mathbf{O}$-algebras, we then prove that strict algebras in $\mathbf{V}$ are equivalent to $\infty$-categorical algebras in the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category associated to $\mathbf{V}$. We also show that for an $\infty$-operad $\mathcal{O}$ enriched in a suitable closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$, we can equivalently describe $\mathcal{O}$-algebras in $\mathcal{V}$ as morphisms of $\infty$-operads from $\mathcal{O}$ to a self-enrichment of $\mathcal{V}$.</description>

      <title>Towards a Categorical Foundation of Deep Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented pace of machine learning research has lead to incredible advances, but also poses hard challenges. At present, the field lacks strong theoretical underpinnings, and many important achievements stem from ad hoc design choices which are hard to justify in principle and whose effectiveness often goes unexplained. Research debt is increasing and many papers are found not to be reproducible.
  This thesis is a survey that covers some recent work attempting to study machine learning categorically. Category theory is a branch of abstract mathematics that has found successful applications in many fields, both inside and outside mathematics. Acting as a lingua franca of mathematics and science, category theory might be able to give a unifying structure to the field of machine learning. This could solve some of the aforementioned problems.
  In this work, we mainly focus on the application of category theory to deep learning. Namely, we discuss the use of categorical optics to model gradient-based learning, the use of categorical algebras and integral transforms to link classical computer science to neural networks, the use of functors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure, and, finally, the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of neural network architectures.</description>
