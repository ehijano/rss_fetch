      <title>Bifurcations of nonlinear dynamics in coupled twin spin masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin masers are a prototype nonlinear dynamic system. They undergo a bifurcation at a critical amplification factor, transiting into a limit cycle phase characterized by a Larmor precession around the external bias magnetic field, thereby serving as a key frequency reference for precision measurements. Recently, a system of coupled twin spin masers placed in dual bias magnetic fields, involving simultaneously two intrinsic Larmor frequencies, has been studied. Compared with previous spin masers, this setup exhibits new attractors such as quasi-periodic orbits and chaos in addition to the usual limit cycles and the trivial no signal fixed point. The richer dynamic phases imply the existence of bifurcations, whose nature has not been fully analyzed. Here, to shed light on the nature of the bifurcations, we turn to a closely related system and systematically study the various bifurcations therein along different routes in parameter space. We identify the bifurcations as of the types including pitchfork, Hopf, homoclinic bifurcations, and saddle-node bifurcations of cycles. By both analytical and numerical methods, we reveal how various attractors interplay with each other and change their stability. We also quantitatively evaluate the locations where these bifurcations occur by tracking the both stable and even not easily detected unstable limit cycles. These findings deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms resulting in the rich dynamic phases in the coupled twin spin masers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin dynamics induced by feedback under continuous Larmor frequency distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear spin dynamics are essential in exploring nonequilibrium quantum phenomena and have broad applications in precision measurement. Among these systems, the combination of a bias magnetic field and feedback mechanisms can induce self-sustained oscillations at the base Larmor frequency due to nonlinearity. These features have driven the development of single-species and multiple-species spin masers. The latter, with multiple discrete Larmor frequencies, provides significant advantages for precision measurement by mitigating uncertainties in precession frequencies due to long-term drifts in experimental conditions. The self-sustained oscillations of single-species and multiple-species spin masers correspond to limit cycles and quasi-periodic orbits of the stable nonlinear dynamics of the systems respectively; the correspondence is elucidated in a recent study on a related spin system featuring two discrete intrinsic Larmor frequencies under dual bias magnetic fields. Here, we extend the study to the case that the intrinsic Larmor frequencies of individual spins of the system, given rise to by an inhomogeneous bias magnetic field, form a continuum. We show that generically the stable dynamics of the system includes limit cycles, quasi-periodic orbits, and chaos. We establish the relation between the synchronization frequency of limit cycles and the field inhomogeneity and derive an equation determining the stability of limit cycles. Furthermore, detailed characteristics of different dynamical phases, especially the robustness of limit cycles and quasi-periodic orbits against experimental fluctuations, are discussed. Our findings not only encompass the case of discrete Larmor frequencies, but also provide crucial insights for precision measurement and the exploration of continuous time crystals and quasi-crystals.</description>

      <title>Modeling urbanization dynamics by labor force migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individual participants in human society collectively exhibit aggregation behavior. In this study, we present a simple microscopic model of labor force migration based on the active Brownian particles framework. In particular, agent-based simulations show that the model produces clusters of agents from a random initial distribution. Furthermore, two empirical regularities called Zipf's and Okun's laws were observed. To reveal the mechanism underlying the reproduced aggregation phenomena, we use our microscopic model to derive an extended Keller--Segel system, which is a classic model describing the aggregation behavior of biological organisms called taxis. The obtained macroscopic system indicates that the concentration of the workforce in the real world can be explained through a new type of taxis central to human behavior, highlighting the relevance of urbanization to blow-up phenomena in the derived PDE system. We then characterize the transition between the aggregation and diffusion regimes both analytically and computationally. The predicted long-term dynamics of urbanization -- originating in the asymmetric natures of employed and unemployed agents -- are compared with global empirical data, particularly in the realms of labor statistics and urban indicators.</description>

      <title>Metastability of multi-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Ott-Antonsen reduced $M$-population of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators is investigated, focusing on the influence of the phase-lag parameter $\alpha$ on the collective dynamics. For oscillator populations coupled on a ring, we obtained a wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns, including coherent states, traveling waves, partially synchronized states, modulated states, and incoherent states. Back-and-forth transitions between these states are found, which suggest metastability. Linear stability analysis reveals the stable regions of coherent states with different winding numbers $q$. Within certain $\alpha$ ranges, the system settles into stable traveling wave solutions despite the coherent states also being linearly stable. For around $\alpha \approx 0.46\pi$, the system displays the most frequent metastable transitions between coherent states and partially synchronized states, while for $\alpha$ closer to $\pi/2$, metastable transitions arise between partially synchronized states and modulated states. This model captures metastable dynamics akin to brain activity, offering insights into the synchronization of brain networks.</description>
