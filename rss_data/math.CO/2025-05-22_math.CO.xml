      <title>The strong hull property for affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjecture proposed by Gaetz and Gao asserts that the Cayley graph of any Coxeter group possesses the strong hull property. This conjecture has been proved for symmetric groups, hyperoctahedral groups, all right-angled Coxeter groups, and computationally verified for finite Coxeter groups of types $D_4$, $F_4$, $G_2$, and $H_3$. This paper investigates all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3, specifically those of affine types $\widetilde{A}_2$, $\widetilde{C}_2$, and $\widetilde{G}_2$. By employing key concepts from building theory, we develop novel techniques: first reducing and classifying the convex hull in their Cayley graphs into finitely many cases, then proving the strong hull conjecture for these cases through combinatorial computations. Notably, for the case of affine type $\widetilde{G}_2$, we streamline the proof strategy by reducing it to a corollary of results established for affine type $\widetilde{A}_2$. The reduction techniques developed in this study demonstrate potential for generalization. Their possible algebraic reformulation may not only provide new perspectives for further investigation of this conjecture but also offer methodological insights for algebraic combinatorics and geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized algebraic connectivity of graphs in Euclidean spaces: extremal properties and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph rigidity, the study of vertex realizations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and the motions that preserve the induced edge lengths, has been the focus of extensive research for decades. Its equivalency to graph connectivity for $d=1$ is well known; thus it can be viewed as a generalization that incorporates geometric constraints. Graph connectivity is commonly quantified by the algebraic connectivity, the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. Recently, a graph invariant for quantifying graph rigidity in $\mathbb{R}^d$, termed the generalized algebraic connectivity, was introduced. Recognizing the intrinsic relationship between rigidity and connectivity, this article presents new contributions. In particular, we introduce the d-rigidity ratio as a metric for expressing the level of rigidity of a graph in $\mathbb{R}^d$ relative to its connectivity. We show that this ratio is bounded and provide extremal examples. Additionally, we offer a new upper bound for the generalized algebraic connectivity that depends inversely on the diameter and on the vertex connectivity, thereby improving previous bounds. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between graph rigidity and the diameter, a measure of the graph's overall extent. We provide the maximal diameter achievable by rigid graphs and show that generalized path graphs serve as extremal examples. Finally, we derive an upper bound for the generalized algebraic connectivity of generalized path graphs that (asymptotically) improves upon existing ones by a factor of four.</description>

      <title>On Forest and Bipartite Cuts in Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to sufficient conditions for the existence of vertex cuts in simple graphs, where the induced subgraph on the cut vertices belongs to a specified graph class. In particular, we show that any connected graph with $n$ vertices and fewer than $(19n - 28)/8$ edges admits a forest cut. This result improves upon recent bounds, although it does not resolve the conjecture that the sharp threshold is $3n - 6$ (Chernyshev, Rauch, Rautenbach, 2024). Furthermore, we prove that if the number of edges is less than $(80n-134)/31$, then the graph admits a bipartite cut.</description>

      <title>Non-side-to-side tilings of the sphere by congruent triangles with any irrational angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the basic and new tools for classifying non-side-to-side tilings of the sphere by congruent triangles. Then we prove that, if the triangle has any irrational angle in degree, such tilings are: a sequence of 1-parameter families of triangles each admitting many 2-layer earth map tilings with $2n$($n\geq3$) tiles, together with rotational modifications for even $n$; a 1-parameter family of triangles each admitting a unique tiling with $8$ tiles; and a sporadic triangle admitting a unique tiling with $16$ tiles. Then a scheme is outlined to classify the case with all angles being rational in degree, justified by some known and new examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show how to define certain Riordan arrays, that we call the Fuss-Catalan-Riordan arrays, by means of a special family of $d$-orthogonal polynomials. We relate the Fuss-Catalan Riordan arrays to the Fuss Catalan numbers, and to certain lattice paths. We emphasise the role of the production matrices of the Riordan arrays that we encounter in our study.</description>

      <title>Fractional balanced chromatic number and arboricity of planar (signed) graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fractional coloring of a signed graph $(G, {\sigma})$ is an assignment of nonnegative weights to the balanced sets (sets which do not induce a negative cycle) such that each vertex has an accumulated weight of at least 1. The minimum total wight among all such colorings is defined to be the fractional balanced chromatic number, denoted by $\chi-{fb}(G, {\sigma})$. This value is clearly upper bounded by the fractional arboricity of $G$, denoted $a_f (G)$, where weights are assigned to sets inducing no cycle rather than sets inducing no negative cycle. In this work we present an example of a planar signed simple graph of fractional balanced chromatic number larger than 2, thus in particular refuting a conjecture of Bonamy, Kardos, Kelly, and Postle suggesting that the fractional arboricity of planar graphs is bounded above by 2. By iterating the construction, we show that the supremum of the fractional balanced chromatic number of planar signed simple graphs is at least as $83/41 = 2 + 1/41$. With similar operations, we built a sequence of planar graphs whose limit of fractional arboricity is $a_f (G) = 2 + 2/25$.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees of bounded degree in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the sharp threshold for the containment of all $n$-vertex trees of bounded degree in random geometric graphs with $n$ vertices. This provides a geometric counterpart of Montgomery's threshold result for binomial random graphs, and confirms a conjecture of Espuny D\'iaz, Lichev, Mitsche, and Wesolek. Our proof is algorithmic and adapts to other families of graphs, in particular graphs with bounded genus or tree-width.</description>

      <title>Dimension of unicycle posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of the dimension of random posets, it was conjectured by Bollob\'as and Brightwell in 1997 that if $P$ is a finite poset whose cover graph contains at most one cycle then its order dimension is at most $3$. In this paper we prove this conjecture by giving a constructive proof with explicit triplets of linear extensions realizing such posets.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theoretic divisor axiom for flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an identity for (torus-equivariant) 3-point, genus 0, $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of full or partial flag manifolds, which can be thought of as a replacement for the ``divisor axiom'' for the (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory of flag manifolds. This identity enables us to compute the (torus-equivariant) 3-point, genus 0, $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants defined by two Schubert classes and a divisor Schubert class in the (torus-equivariant) ordinary $K$-theory ring of flag manifolds. We prove this identity by making use of the Chevalley formula for the (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory ring of flag manifolds, which is described in terms of the quantum Bruhat graph.</description>

      <title>On the Two Paths Theorem and the Two Disjoint Paths Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tuple (s1,t1,s2,t2) of vertices in a simple undirected graph is 2-linked when there are two vertex-disjoint paths respectively from s1 to t1 and s2 to t2. A graph is 2-linked when all such tuples are 2-linked. We give a new and simple proof of the ``two paths theorem'', a characterisation of edge-maximal graphs which are not 2-linked as webs: particular near triangulations filled with cliques. Our proof works by generalising the theorem, replacing the four vertices above by an arbitrary tuple; it does not require major theorems such as Kuratowski's or Menger's theorems. Instead it follows an inductive characterisation of generalised webs via parallel composition, a graph operation consisting in taking a disjoint union before identifying some pairs of vertices. We use the insights provided by this proof to design a simple O(nm) recursive algorithm for the ``two vertex-disjoint paths'' problem. This algorithm is constructive in that it returns either two disjoint paths, or an embedding of the input graph into a web.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain polylogarithmic bounds in the polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem when the polynomials have distinct degrees and zero constant terms. Specifically, let $P_1, \dots, P_m \in \mathbb Z[y]$ be polynomials with distinct degrees, each having zero constant term. Then there exists a constant $c = c(P_1,\dots,P_m) &gt; 0$ such that any subset $A \subset \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ of density at least $(\log N)^{-c}$ contains a nontrivial polynomial progression of the form $x, x+P_1(y), \dots, x+P_m(y)$. In addition, we prove an effective ``popular'' version, showing that every dense subset $A$ has some non-zero $y$ such that the number of polynomial progressions in $A$ with this difference $y$ is almost optimal.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

Abstract: Given $1\le \ell &lt;k$ and $\delta\ge0$, let $\textbf{PM}(k,\ell,\delta)$ be the decision problem for the existence of perfect matchings in $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraphs with minimum $\ell$-degree at least $\delta\binom{n-\ell}{k-\ell}$. For $k\ge 3$, $\textbf{PM}(k,\ell,0)$ was one of the first NP-complete problems by Karp. Keevash, Knox and Mycroft conjectured that $\textbf{PM}(k, \ell, \delta)$ is in P for every $\delta &gt; 1-(1-1/k)^{k-\ell}$ and verified the case $\ell=k-1$.
  In this paper we show that this problem can be reduced to the study of the minimum $\ell$-degree condition forcing the existence of fractional perfect matchings. Together with existing results on fractional perfect matchings, this solves the conjecture of Keevash, Knox and Mycroft for $\ell\ge 0.4k$. Moreover, we also supply an algorithm that outputs a perfect matching, provided that one exists.</description>

Abstract: In a digraph, a dicut is a cut where all the arcs cross in one direction. A dijoin is a subset of arcs that intersects each dicut. Woodall conjectured in 1976 that in every digraph, the minimum size of a dicut equals to the maximum number of disjoint dijoins. However, prior to our work, it was not even known whether at least $3$ disjoint dijoins exist in an arbitrary digraph whose minimum dicut size is sufficiently large. By building connections with nowhere-zero (circular) $k$-flows, we prove that every digraph with minimum dicut size $\tau$ contains $\left\lfloor\frac{\tau}{k}\right\rfloor$ disjoint dijoins if the underlying undirected graph admits a nowhere-zero (circular) $k$-flow. The existence of nowhere-zero $6$-flows in $2$-edge-connected graphs (Seymour 1981) directly leads to the existence of $\left\lfloor\frac{\tau}{6}\right\rfloor$ disjoint dijoins in a digraph with minimum dicut size $\tau$, which can be found in polynomial time as well. The existence of nowhere-zero circular $\frac{2p+1}{p}$-flows in $6p$-edge-connected graphs (Lov\'asz et al. 2013) directly leads to the existence of $\left\lfloor\frac{\tau p}{2p+1}\right\rfloor$ disjoint dijoins in a digraph with minimum dicut size $\tau$ whose underlying undirected graph is $6p$-edge-connected. We also discuss reformulations of Woodall's conjecture into packing strongly connected orientations.</description>

      <title>The Cellular Homology of Digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{TY}, we investigate the pair $(P, \Supp(P))$ of minimal path $P$ and its supporting sub-digraph $\Supp(P)$ in the path complex of a digraph $G$ under the strongly regular condition. In this paper, first, we consider the special minimal path $P$ specified by the admissible condition (Definition \ref{admpair}), which means that $(P,\Supp(P))$ admits a singular cubical realization. Based on such a subset, we systematically introduce the definitions of cellular chain complex associated to $G$ and prove the well-definedness. Then we study several properties of such cellular homologies. Finally, we present several intriguing examples as well as some important observations.</description>

      <title>A resolution of the Aharoni-Korman conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A poset $P$ is said to satisfy the finite antichain condition, or FAC for short, if it has no infinite antichain. It was conjectured by Aharoni and Korman in 1992 that any FAC poset $P$ possesses a chain $C$ and a partition into antichains such that $C$ meets every antichain of the partition. Our main results are twofold. We provide a counterexample to the conjecture in full generality, but, despite this, we also prove that the conjecture does hold true for a broad class of posets. In particular, we prove that the Aharoni-Korman conjecture holds for countable posets avoiding intervals $I$ such that either $I$ or its reverse $I^*$ is of the form $\bigoplus_{x\in\omega} Q_x$, where each $Q_x$ is infinite and co-wellfounded.
  In pursuit of these goals, we also investigate other facets of the structure of FAC posets. In particular, we consider strongly maximal chains in FAC posets, proving some results, and posing several questions and conjectures.</description>

Abstract: The planar Tur\'an number of $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. The planar Tur\'an number of $k(k\geq 3)$ vertex-disjoint union of cycles is the trivial value $3n-6$. We determine the planar Tur\'an number of $C_{3}\text{-}C_{3}$ and $C_{3}\text{-}C_{4}$, where $C_{k}\text{-}C_{\ell}$ denotes the graph consisting of two disjoint cycles $C_k$ with an edge connecting them.</description>

Abstract: A separated $d$-interval is defined as a disjoint union of $d$ convex sets from the real line $\mathbb R$. In this paper, we establish a series of Helly-type theorems for convexity spaces derived from separated $d$-intervals. Our results encompass the Radon number, Helly number, colorful Helly number, fractional Helly number, colorful fractional Helly theorem, $(p,q)$ theorem, and two kinds of colorful $(p,q)$ theorems for these convexity spaces. The primary tools employed in our proofs involve simplicial complexes and collapsibility.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to two conjectures on Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1984, Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with $n+1$ curves. His conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the dual graph of any simple Venn diagram has a Hamilton cycle. In this work, we construct counterexamples to Winkler's conjecture for all $n\geq 6$. As part of this proof, we computed all 3.430.404 simple Venn diagrams with $n=6$ curves (even their number was not previously known), among which we found 72 counterexamples. While working on Winkler's conjecture, Pruesse and Ruskey considered the (multi)graph whose vertices are the crossings of the curves of a Venn diagram and curve segments between consecutive crossings form the edges. They proved that this graph has a Hamilton cycle for every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves, and conjectured that this also holds for non-simple diagrams. We construct counterexamples to this conjecture for all $n\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Projected Gradient Descent Method for Tropical Principal Component Analysis over Tree Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2019, Yoshida et al. developed tropical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that is, an analogue of the classical PCA in the setting of tropical geometry and applied it to visualize a set of gene trees over a space of phylogenetic trees which is an union of lower dimensional polyhedral cones in an Euclidean space with its dimension $m(m-1)/2$ where $m$ is the number of leaves. In this paper, we introduce a projected gradient descent method to estimate the tropical principal polytope over the space of phylogenetic trees and we apply it to apicomplexa dataset. With computational experiment against Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, we show that our projected gradient descent has a lower sum of tropical distances between observations and their projections on an estimated best-fit tropical polytope compared with the MCMC approach proposed by Page et al.~in 2020.</description>

      <title>Deranged Perfect Matchings on complete graph and balanced complete r-partite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proved that for any finite collection of sparse subgraphs $(D_m)_{m=1}^\ell$ of the complete graph $K_{2n}$, and a uniformly chosen perfect matching $R$ in $K_{2n}$, the random vector $(|E(R \cap D_m)|)_{m=1}^\ell$ jointly converges to a vector of independent Poisson random variables with mean $|E(D_m)|/(2n)$. We also showed a similar result when $K_{2n}$ is replaced by the balanced complete $r$-partite graph $K_{r \times 2n/r}$ for fixed $r$ and determined the asymptotic joint distribution. The proofs rely on elementary tools of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion and generating functions. These results extend recent works of Johnston, Kayll and Palmer, Spiro and Surya, and Granet and Joos from the univariate to the multivariate setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, firstly, we will study the structure of the path complex $(\Omega_*(G;\Z),\partial)$ of a digraph $G$ via the $\Z$-generators of $\Omega_*(G,\Z)$ under strongly regular condition, which is called the minimal path in \cite{HY}. In particular, we will study various examples of the minimal $3$-paths. Secondly, we will show that the supporting sub-digraph of minimal path has acyclic path homologies. Thirdly, we will consider the applications of such an acyclic model.</description>

      <title>Reachability in temporal graphs under perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reachability and other path-based measures on temporal graphs can be used to understand spread of infection, information, and people in modelled systems. Due to delays and errors in reporting, temporal graphs derived from data are unlikely to perfectly reflect reality, especially with respect to the precise times at which edges appear. To reflect this uncertainty, we consider a model in which some number $\zeta$ of edge appearances may have their timestamps perturbed by $\pm\delta$ for some $\delta$. Within this model, we investigate temporal reachability and consider the problem of determining the maximum number of vertices any vertex can reach under these perturbations. We show that this problem is intractable in general but is efficiently solvable when $\zeta$ is sufficiently large. We also give algorithms which solve this problem in several restricted settings. We complement this with some contrasting results concerning the complexity of related temporal eccentricity problems under perturbation.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of the poset $\mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing systems, consisting of composable collections of arities for $\mathcal{T}$-equivariant algebraic structures, where $\mathcal{T}$ is an orbital $\infty$-category, such as the orbit category of a finite group. In particular, we show that these are equivalent to weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing categories and characterize various unitality conditions.
  Within this sits a natural generalization $\mathrm{Index}_{\mathcal{T}} \subset \mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of Blumberg-Hill's indexing systems, consisting of arities for structures possessing binary operations and unit elements. We characterize the relationship between the posets of unital weak indexing systems and indexing systems, the latter remaining isomorphic to transfer systems on this level of generality. We use this to characterize the poset of unital $C_{p^n}$-weak indexing systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $r_{A,h}(n)$, the number of representations of integers $n$ as sums of $h$ elements from subsets $A$ of $k$-th powers $\mathbb{N}^k$ and $k$-th powers of primes $\mathbb{P}^k$ for $k \geq 1$. Extending work by Vu, Wooley, and others, we show that for $h \geq h_k = O(8^k k^2)$, if $F$ is a regularly varying function satisfying $\lim_{n\to\infty} F(n)/\log n = \infty$, then there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k$ such that
  \[ r_{A,h}(n) \sim \mathfrak{S}_{k,h}(n)F(n), \]
  where $\mathfrak{S}_{k,h}(n)$ is the singular series from Waring's problem.
  For $h \geq 2k^2(2\log k + \log\log k + O(1))$, we show the existence of $A \subseteq \mathbb{P}^k$ with
  \[ r_{A,h}(n) \sim \mathfrak{S}^*_{k,h}(n) c n^\kappa \]
  for $0 &lt; \kappa &lt; h/k - 1$ and $c &gt; 0$, where $\mathfrak{S}^*_{k,h}(n)$ is the singular series from Waring--Goldbach's problem. Additionally, for $0 \leq \kappa \leq h/k - 1$ and functions $\psi$ satisfying $\psi(x) \asymp_{\lambda} \psi(x^{\lambda})$ for every $\lambda&gt;0$, if $\log x \ll x^{\kappa} \psi(x) \ll x^{h/k-1}/(\log x)^h$, then there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{P}^k$ with $r_{A,h}(n) \asymp n^\kappa \psi(n)$ for $n$ satisfying certain congruence conditions, producing thin subbases of prime powers when $\kappa = 0$, $\psi = \log$.</description>

Abstract: The edge group of a simplicial complex is a well-known, combinatorial version of the fundamental group. It is a group associated to a simplicial complex that consists of equivalence classes of edge loops and that is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) fundamental group of the spatial realization. We define a counterpart to the edge group that likewise gives a combinatorial version of the second (higher) homotopy group. Working entirely combinatorially, we show our group is an abelian group and also respects products. We show that our combinatorially defined group is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) second homotopy group of the spatial realization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prototypical examples of a cluster algebra is the coordinate ring of a finite Grassmannian: using the Pl\"ucker embedding the cluster algebra structure allows one to move between `maximal sets' of algebraically independent Pl\"ucker coordinates via mutations. Fioresi and Hacon studied a specific colimit of the coordinate rings of finite Grassmannians and its link with the infinite Grassmannian introduced by Sato and independently by Segal and Wilson in connection with the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) hierarchy, an infinite set of nonlinear partial differential equations which possess soliton solutions. In this article we prove that this ring is a cluster algebra of infinite rank with the structure induced by the colimit construction. More generally, we prove that cluster algebras of infinite rank are precisely the ind-objects of a natural category of cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a family of polynomials $$S_n^{(m)}(x):=\sum_{i,j=0}^n\binom ni^m\binom nj^m\binom{i+j}ix^{i+j}\ \ (m,n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ For example, we show that $$\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}S_k^{(0)}(x)\equiv\frac x{2x-1}\left(1+\left(\frac{1-4x^2}p\right)\right)\pmod p $$ for any odd prime $p$ and integer $x\not\equiv1/2\pmod p$, where $(\frac{\cdot}p)$ denotes the Legendre symbol. We also formulate some open conjectures on related congruences and series for $1/\pi$. For example, we conjecture that $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(7k+1)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/11)}{9^k}=\frac{5445}{104\sqrt{39}\,\pi}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty(1365k+181)\frac{S_k^{(2)}(1/18)}{16^k}=\frac{1377}{\sqrt2\,\pi}.$$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we bound the rate of linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with the property that any $k\leq q$ codewords are all simultaneously distinct in at least $d_k$ coordinates. For the particular case $d_k=1$, this leads to bounds on the rate of linear $q$-ary $k$-hash codes which generalize, with a simpler proof, results recently obtained for the case $q=k=3$ by Pohoata and Zakharov and by Bishnoi, D'haeseleer, Gijswijt and Potukuchi. We finally discuss some related open problems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels.</description>
