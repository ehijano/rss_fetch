      <title>Autonomous Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Using DOLA: A Privacy-Preserving, LLM-Based Optimization Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-intensive process, often impacted by inter-planner variability and subjective decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA), an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing radiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA integrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning system, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local infrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA using a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in 20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and optimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations. The 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving approximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach outperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated convergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and reinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified 0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This proof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally hosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a commercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction through interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and privacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical implementation and workflow improvement.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Model for Estimating Vessel Size Distribution from MR Gradient Echo Sampling of the Free Induction Decay and Spin Echo Sequence Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vascular remodelling is inherent to the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, fibrosis, hypertension, and diabetes. In this paper, a new susceptibility-contrast based MRI approach is established to non-invasively image intravoxel vessel size distribution (VSD), enabling a more comprehensive and quantitative assessment of vascular remodelling. The approach is founded on imaging vascular structures across a rodent brain using high-resolution, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, simulating gradient echo sampling of free induction decay and spin echo (GESFIDE) MRI signals for the three-dimensional vascular networks, and training a deep learning model to predict cerebral blood volume (CBV) and VSD from GESFIDE signals. The results from ex vivo experiments demonstrated strong correlation (r = 0.96) between the true and predicted CBV. Also, high similarity between true and predicted VSDs was observed (mean Bhattacharya Coefficient = 0.92). With further in vivo validation, intravoxel VSD imaging could become a transformative preclinical and clinical tool for interrogating disease and treatment induced vascular remodelling.</description>

      <title>Determination of unscaled blood input for human dynamic FDG brain PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Many existing techniques for the non-invasive quantification of the blood input function in dynamic FDG-PET imaging require strong historical information or user input. The technique proposed in this work utilizes the assumption that a dynamic PET scan can be modeled by the Patlak plot to determine an unscaled blood input function. Materials and Methods: The time activity curve (TAC) for each voxel in a dynamic image can be considered as an n-dimensional vector. In this context, a TAC follows the Patlak plot if and only if the TAC is a linear combination of the blood input function and the integral of the blood input function. Given a set of TACs which follow the Patlak plot, we can thus use PCA to determine a basis which spans the same vector space as the blood input function and the integral of the blood input function. We then seek to find two TACs in this vector space which best satisfy that the estimated anti-derivative of one of the TACs is close to the other TAC; such TACs are candidates for the blood input function and the integral of the blood input function. We were able to construct a low (2) dimensional optimization problem to find such TACs. Results: We applied our results to obtain predicted blood input functions and Ki maps for twelve normal subjects. Scaling the predicted blood input function to best match the ground truth, we achieved an average SSE of $0.042 \pm 0.032$ and an average DTW distance of $0.141 \pm 0.053$. Matching the means of the predicted and ground truth Ki maps, we achieved an average MAPE of $2.539 \pm 0.928$ and an average SSIM of $0.991 \pm 0.005$. Conclusion: While not often viewed as such, the assumption that some dynamic data follows a kinetic model gives strong prior information. In the case of the Patlak plot, we can use this assumption to estimate an unscaled blood input function and unscaled Ki map.</description>

      <title>SNRAware: Improved Deep Learning MRI Denoising with SNR Unit Training and G-factor Map Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop and evaluate a new deep learning MR denoising method that leverages quantitative noise distribution information from the reconstruction process to improve denoising performance and generalization.
  This retrospective study trained 14 different transformer and convolutional models with two backbone architectures on a large dataset of 2,885,236 images from 96,605 cardiac retro-gated cine complex series acquired at 3T. The proposed training scheme, termed SNRAware, leverages knowledge of the MRI reconstruction process to improve denoising performance by simulating large, high quality, and diverse synthetic datasets, and providing quantitative information about the noise distribution to the model. In-distribution testing was performed on a hold-out dataset of 3000 samples with performance measured using PSNR and SSIM, with ablation comparison without the noise augmentation. Out-of-distribution tests were conducted on cardiac real-time cine, first-pass cardiac perfusion, and neuro and spine MRI, all acquired at 1.5T, to test model generalization across imaging sequences, dynamically changing contrast, different anatomies, and field strengths. The best model found in the in-distribution test generalized well to out-of-distribution samples, delivering 6.5x and 2.9x CNR improvement for real-time cine and perfusion imaging, respectively. Further, a model trained with 100% cardiac cine data generalized well to a T1 MPRAGE neuro 3D scan and T2 TSE spine MRI.</description>

      <title>Limited-angle SPECT image reconstruction using deep image prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In SPECT image reconstruction, limited-angle (LA) conditions lead to a loss of frequency components, which distort the reconstructed tomographic image along directions corresponding to the non-collected projection angle range. Although conventional iterative image reconstruction methods have been used to improve the reconstructed images in LA conditions, the image quality is still unsuitable for clinical use. We propose a LA SPECT image reconstruction method that uses an end-to-end deep image prior (DIP) framework to improve reconstructed image quality. The proposed LA SPECT image reconstruction is an end-to-end DIP framework which incorporates a forward projection model into the loss function to optimise the neural network. By also incorporating a binary mask that indicates whether each data point in the measured projection data has been collected, the proposed method restores the non-collected projection data and reconstructs a less distorted image. The proposed method was evaluated using 20 numerical phantoms and clinical patient data. In numerical simulations, the proposed method outperformed existing back-projection-based methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM. We analysed the reconstructed tomographic images in the frequency domain using an object-specific modulation transfer function, in simulations and on clinical patient data, to evaluate the response of the reconstruction method to different frequencies of the object. The proposed method significantly improved the response to almost all spatial frequencies, even in the non-collected projection angle range. The results demonstrate that the proposed method reconstructs a less distorted tomographic image. The proposed end-to-end DIP-based reconstruction method restores lost frequency components and mitigates image distortion under LA conditions by incorporating a binary mask into the loss function.</description>

      <title>In-vivo real-time 13C-MRSI without polarizer on site: across cities transportable hyperpolarization using UV-induced labile radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (HP 13C-MRSI) has the potential to greatly improve diagnostic radiology thanks to its unique capability to detect, noninvasively, a wide range of diseases entailing aberrant metabolism. Nevertheless, it struggles to enter everyday clinical practice as an alternative and/or complement to Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Because of the minute-long hyperpolarization lifetime of the MR HP contrast agents, one of the reasons is, differently from PET, the need and financial burden to have the polarizing machine on site and, as close as possible to the MR scanner. In this work, we show that dDNP samples prepared with UV-induced labile radicals can bridge the technical gap with PET and provide MRI facilities with hours-long relaxing HP contrast agents. As a demonstration, we show the first across cities HP 13C-MRSI experiment in vivo and on a clinical scanner for a perfusion/angiography ([1-13C]HP001) and a metabolic ([U-13C, d7]glucose) contrast agent.</description>

      <title>Deep non-invasive cerebral blood flow sensing using diffuse correlation spectroscopy and ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a crucial indicator of brain function, and its continuous monitoring is critical for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a non-invasive diffuse optical technique to investigate deep tissue microvascular dynamics. However, traditional DCS systems face challenges in real-time applications due to reliance on correlation boards or software autocorrelators for signal acquisition, which limits their practical use. Furthermore, most existing DCS measurements are confined to a source-detector separation, \rho = 20 - 30 mm, with a maximum \rho = 40 mm, potentially reducing cerebral hemodynamics assessment accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we utilized a fully in-house-built 512 x 512 single-photon avalanche diode array (SPAD) called ATLAS, featuring innovative on-chip autocorrelators. The ATLAS-DCS system was evaluated against a commercial correlator board DCS system for liquid phantoms and cuff occlusion studies. Also, we successfully monitored pulsatile blood flow at \rho of 50 mm with a high sampling rate of up to 56.3 Hz in a human forehead in vivo. Our system also demonstrated high fidelity in detecting human pulse and identifying behaviour-induced physiological variations from the subject's prefrontal cortex during video gaming. We show that the ATLAS-DCS system outperforms the commonly used APD-based DCS system, achieving more than 571x SNR improvement in a milk-phantom at \rho of 20 mm. This DCS on-chip design paves the way for high-speed biological signal measurement in real-time applications by significantly enhancing detection sensitivity and speed.</description>

      <title>The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Enhancing Insulin Recommendations and Therapy Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing worldwide incidence of diabetes requires more effective approaches for managing blood glucose levels. Insulin delivery systems have advanced significantly, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a key role in improving their precision and adaptability. AI algorithms, particularly those based on reinforcement learning, allow for personalised insulin dosing by continuously adapting to an individual's responses. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data privacy, algorithm transparency, and accessibility still need to be addressed. Continued progress and validation in AI-driven insulin delivery systems promise to improve therapy outcomes further, offering people more effective and individualised management of their diabetes. This paper presents an overview of current strategies, key challenges, and future directions.</description>
