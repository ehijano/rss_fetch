      <title>Simplicial lists in operad theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a category $\mathsf{List}$ whose objects are sets and morphisms are mappings which assign to an element in the domain an ordered sequence (list) of elements in the codomain. We introduce and study a category of simplicial objects $\mathsf{slist}$ whose objects are functors $\Delta^{op} \to \mathsf{List}$, which we call simplicial lists, and morphisms are natural transformations which have functions as components. We demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ supports the combinatorics of (non-symmetric) operads by constructing a fully-faithful nerve functor $N^l : \mathsf{Operad} \to \mathsf{sList}$ from the category of operads. This leads to a reasonable model for the theory of non-symmetric $\infty$-operads.
  We also demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ has the structure of a presheaf category. In particular, we study a subcategory $\mathsf{sList}_{\text{op}}$ of operadic simplicial lists, in which the nerve functor takes values. The latter category is also a presheaf category over a base whose objects may be interpreted as levelled trees. We construct a coherent nerve functor which outputs an $\infty$-operad for each operad enriched in Kan complexes. We also define homology groups of simplicial lists and study first properties.</description>

      <title>On fusing matrices associated with conformal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Strict universes for Grothendieck topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hofmann and Streicher famously showed how to lift Grothendieck universes into presheaf topoi, and Streicher has extended their result to the case of sheaf topoi by sheafification. In parallel, van den Berg and Moerdijk have shown in the context of algebraic set theory that similar constructions continue to apply even in weaker metatheories. Unfortunately, sheafification seems not to preserve an important realignment property enjoyed by the presheaf universes that plays a critical role in models of univalent type theory as well as synthetic Tait computability, a recent technique to establish syntactic properties of type theories and programming languages. In the context of multiple universes, the realignment property also implies a coherent choice of codes for connectives at each universe level, thereby interpreting the cumulativity laws present in popular formulations of Martin-L\"of type theory.
  We observe that a slight adjustment to an argument of Shulman constructs a cumulative universe hierarchy satisfying the realignment property at every level in any Grothendieck topos. Hence one has direct-style interpretations of Martin-L\"of type theory with cumulative universes into all Grothendieck topoi. A further implication is to extend the reach of recent synthetic methods in the semantics of cubical type theory and the syntactic metatheory of type theory and programming languages to all Grothendieck topoi.</description>

      <title>Costability of Comodules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of augmented $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the stabilization of the infinity category of augmented $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic methods for Ramsey degrees of unary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the existence of small and big Ramsey degrees of classes of finite unary algebras in arbitrary (not necessarily finite) algebraic language $\Omega$. We think of unary algebras as $M$-sets where $M = \Omega^*$ is the free monoid of words over the alphabet $\Omega$ and show that for an arbitrary monoid $M$ (finite or infinite) the class of all finite $M$-sets has finite small Ramsey degrees. This immediately implies that the class of all finite $G$-sets, where $G$ is an arbitrary group (finite or infinite), has finite small Ramsey degrees, and that the class of all finite unary algebras over an arbitrary (finite or infinite) algebraic language $\Omega$ has finite small Ramsey degrees. This generalizes some Ramsey-type results of M.\ Soki\'c concerning finite unary algebras over finite languages and finite $G$-sets for finite groups~$G$. To do so we develop a completely new strategy that relies on the fact that right adjoints preserve the Ramsey property. We then treat $M$-sets as Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras for "half a comonad" and using pre-adjunctions transport the Ramsey properties we are interested in from the category of finite or countably infinite chains of order type $\omega$. Moreover, we show that finite objects have finite big Ramsey degrees in the corresponding cofree structures over countably many generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Quillen equivalence between the Kan-Quillen model structure and a model structure, derived from a cubical model of homotopy type theory, on the category of cartesian cubical sets with one connection. We thereby identify a second model structure which both constructively models homotopy type theory and presents infinity-groupoids, the first example being the equivariant cartesian model of Awodey-Cavallo-Coquand-Riehl-Sattler.</description>

      <title>Fibre functors and reconstruction of Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of the present paper is to present a version of the Tannaka-Krein type reconstruction Theorems: If $F:B\to C$ is an exact faithful monoidal functor of tensor categories, one would like to realize $B$ as category of representations of a braided Hopf algebra $H(F)$ in $C$. We prove that this is the case iff $B$ has the additional structure of a monoidal $C$-module category compatible with $F$, which equivalently means that $F$ admits a monoidal section. For Hopf algebras, this reduces to a version of the Radford projection theorem. The Hopf algebra is constructed through the relative coend for module categories. We expect this basic result to have a wide range of applications, in particular in the absence of fibre functors, and we give some applications. One particular motivation was the logarithmic Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces. This means that either the notion of bisimilar natural systems is too rigid or new model structures should be considered on multipointed $d$-spaces.</description>
