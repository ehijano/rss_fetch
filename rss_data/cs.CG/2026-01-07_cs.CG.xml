      <title>Intersection patterns of set systems on manifolds with slowly growing homological shatter functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem of Matou\v{s}ek asserts that for any $k \ge 2$, any set system whose shatter function is $o(n^k)$ enjoys a fractional Helly theorem: in the $k$-wise intersection hypergraph, positive density implies a linear-size clique. Kalai and Meshulam conjectured a generalization of that phenomenon to homological shatter functions. It was verified for set systems with bounded homological shatter functions and ground set with a forbidden homological minor (which includes $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a homological analogue of the van Kampen-Flores theorem). We present two contributions to this line of research:
  - We study homological minors in certain manifolds (possibly with boundary), for which we prove analogues of the van Kampen-Flores theorem and of the Hanani-Tutte theorem.
  - We introduce graded analogues of the Radon and Helly numbers of set systems and relate their growth rate to the original parameters. This allows to extend the verification of the Kalai-Meshulam conjecture for sufficiently slowly growing homological shatter functions.</description>

      <title>MCHex: Marching Cubes Based Adaptive Hexahedral Mesh Generation with Guaranteed Positive Jacobian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing an adaptive hexahedral tessellation to fit an input triangle boundary is a key challenge in grid-based methods. The conventional method first removes outside elements (RO) and then projects the axis-aligned boundary onto the input triangle boundary, which has no guarantee on improving the initial Intersection over Union (IoU) and Hausdorff distance ratio (HR, w.r.t bounding box diagonal). The proposed MCHex approach replaces RO with a Marching Cubes method MCHex. Given the same computational budget (benchmarked using an identical precomputed Signed Distance Field, which dominates the runtime), MCHex provides better boundary approximation (higher IoU and lower HR) while guaranteeing a lower, yet still positive, minimum scaled Jacobian (&gt;0 vs. RO's &gt;0.48).</description>

      <title>Element-Saving Hexahedral 3-Refinement Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conforming hexahedral (hex) meshes are favored in simulation for their superior numerical properties, yet automatically decomposing a general 3D volume into a conforming hex mesh remains a formidable challenge. Among existing approaches, methods that construct an adaptive Cartesian grid and subsequently convert it into a conforming mesh stand out for their robustness. However, the topological schemes enabling this conversion require strict compatibility conditions among grid elements, which inevitably refine the initial grid and increase element count. Developing more relaxed conditions to minimize this overhead has been a persistent research focus. State-of-the-art 2-refinement octree methods employ a weakly-balanced condition combined with a generalized pairing condition, using a dual transformation to yield exceptionally low element counts. Yet this approach suffers from critical limitations: information stored on primal cells, such as signed distance fields or triangle index sets, is lost after dualization, and the resulting dual cells often exhibit poor minimum scaled Jacobian (min SJ) with non-planar quadrilateral (quad) faces. Alternatively, 3-refinement 27-tree methods can directly generate conforming hex meshes through template-based replacement of primal cells, producing higher-quality elements with planar quad faces. However, previous 3-refinement techniques impose conditions far more strict than 2-refinement counterparts, severely over-refining grids by factors of ten to one hundred, creating a major bottleneck in simulation pipelines. This article introduces a novel 3-refinement approach that transforms an adaptive 3-refinement grid into a conforming grid using a moderately-balanced condition, slightly stronger than the weakly-balanced condition but substantially more relaxed than prior 3-refinement requirements......
