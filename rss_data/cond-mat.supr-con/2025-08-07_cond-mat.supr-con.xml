      <title>A Comprehensive Study on A$_2$PdH$_2$: From Ambient to High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first--principles study of the structural stability and superconducting behavior of Li$_2$PdH$_2$ under high pressure. Using random structure searching and phonon calculations, we identify a pressure--induced phase transition from a tetragonal I4/mmm structure, stable up to 5 GPa, to a monoclinic C2/m phase that remains thermodynamically stable up to 50 GPa. Superconductivity is absent in the tetragonal phase, even when anharmonic effects are considered, due to weak electron--phonon coupling and limited hydrogen involvement near the Fermi level. In contrast, the monoclinic phase exhibits a weak but pressure-enhanced superconducting transition, with Tc increasing from 0.6 K at 10 GPa to 4.7 K at 50 GPa, mainly driven by low--frequency Li and Pd-derived phonon modes. We further explore the isostructural A$_2$PdH$_2$ (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs) series to evaluate the impact of alkali-metal substitution on stability and superconductivity. Na, K, and Rb analogs retain dynamic stability at ambient pressure, with weak superconducting critical temperatures of 3.2 K, 2.1 K, and negligible Tc, respectively. Cs$_2$PdH$_2$, however, exhibits phonon instabilities, suggesting a need for external stabilization. These findings highlight the delicate balance between lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and atomic mass in tuning superconductivity in palladium-based hydrides.</description>

      <title>Robust surface superconductivity and vortex lattice in the Weyl semimetal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered compound $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found a peculiar surface superconducting state with a critical temperature two orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence in this new surface superconducting state. Here we measure the superconducting gap and visualize the vortex lattice through very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We find vortices that are anomalously mobile and show that the extremely weak electrostatic interaction between the vortex charge and the STM tip is sufficient to drag the vortices of the surface superconductor. Our results show that surface superconductivity with $T_c=2.9$ K and $H_{c2}\approx 1.8$ T is extraordinarily robust in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$. Furthermore, quasiparticle scattering is enhanced at the position in the reciprocal space of the Fermi arcs, suggesting a connection between Weyl points and surface superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated electronic superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric Re-Os-based high/medium-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of unconventional superconductors, particularly noncentrosymmetric superconductors, has been highly considered as potential materials for understanding the complex properties of quantum materials. Here, five previously unreported Re3.5Os3.5Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3Os3Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5W0.5Nb3, and Re3Os3Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3 Re-Os-based high/medium-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) with valence electron count ranging from 6.45 to 6.81 were synthesized and investigated using x-ray diffraction, transport, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. Our analyses confirm that all five compounds crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type structure and exhibit type-II superconductivity with Tc values from 4.20 K to 5.11 K, respectively. Unexpectedly, despite being immersed in an acidic environment for one month, the structures and superconducting properties of HEAs remain stable. Our findings indicate that the Tc increases with an increasing valence electron count in MEAs-HEAs. Furthermore, these noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type HEA superconductors have large Kadowaki-Woods ratios (KWR), implying the presence of strong electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm interference from coherent spin-polarized edge transport in Fe(Te,Se) superconducting rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the coexistence of Aharonov-Bohm and Little-Parks oscillations in mesoscopic Fe(Te,Se) rings. The magnetoresistance shows two distinct periodicities: an $h/e$ component from ballistic edge interference and an $h/2e$ component from fluxoid quantization of Cooper pairs. Aharonov-Bohm oscillations persist deep into the superconducting phase, exhibit current-field symmetry, and follow a temperature dependence captured by a helical Luttinger liquid model, consistent with edge states in a topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gap symmetry of 2DEG at (111)-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting properties of the two-dimensional electron gas at the (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. Using a multiorbital tight-binding model defined on a hexagonal lattice, we analyze the emergence of superconductivity driven by both interlayer (nearest-neighbor) and intralayer (next-nearest-neighbor) pairing interactions, with a particular focus on the symmetry of the superconducting gap. We demonstrate that, in both pairing scenarios, the superconducting gap transforms according to the $A_1$ irreducible representation of the $C_{6v}$ point group. Within the interlayer pairing scenario, the superconducting phase is characterized by a fully gapped quasiparticle excitation spectrum exhibiting extended $s$-wave symmetry, accompanied by an enhancement of the superconducting gap magnitude in the vicinity of the van Hove singularity. Conversely, the intralayer pairing channel produces a distinctive double-dome structure in the superconducting phase diagram, with the gap symmetry evolving from a fully gapped, extended $s$-wave at low carrier densities to a nodal extended $s$-wave state at higher electron concentrations. The qualitative agreement with experimentally observed nonmonotonic behavior of the critical temperature $T_c(V_g)$ suggests that intralayer next-nearest-neighbor pairing may play a dominant role in the superconductivity of the (111) LAO/STO interface.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian superconducting diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of non-reciprocal phenomena has long captivated interest in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a non-reciprocal phenomenon characterized by unequal critical charge supercurrents flowing in opposite directions in Hermitian superconducting systems. In this study, we introduce an SDE driven by non-Hermiticity in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) under an external magnetic flux, which we refer to as the non-Hermitian SDE. Non-Hermiticity is introduced by coupling one of the two Josephson junctions to a gapless electron reservoir, introducing phase decoherence. Remarkably, we find that an emergent non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution can give rise to SDE in the non-Hermitian SQUID. We analyze the behavior of the SDE under both direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) biases, highlighting the appearance of direction-dependent critical currents and asymmetric Shapiro steps as hallmarks of the SDE. Our findings not only reveal an experimentally accessible mechanism for non-Hermitian SDE but also open new avenues for investigating non-reciprocal phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic mean free path of the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ from thermal Hall conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use thermal transport to access the electronic mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in one of the most widely studied cuprate superconductors, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212). We have measured the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xx}$ and the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ of three single crystals across a range of dopings. In the overdoped and optimally-doped samples, a clear enhancement is observed in both $\kappa_{\rm xx}$ and $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ upon cooling below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, due to a suppression of the inelastic electron-electron scattering as electrons condense into pairs. The underdoped sample shows no enhancement in either, pointing to a high degree of disorder in that sample. For the two highest dopings, the magnitude of the enhancement in $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ is controlled by the strength of the elastic impurity scattering. Using a prior model to estimate the mean free path from $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ data, we find that the mean free path in Bi2212 is approximately 7 times shorter than in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$, considered to be one of the least disordered cuprates. We conclude that the thermal Hall technique is a good way to compare the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in various cuprate materials.</description>

      <title>Third harmonic-mediated amplification in TWPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.</description>

      <title>peaks: a Python package for analysis of angle-resolved photoemission and related spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic band structure, describing the motion and interactions of electrons in materials, dictates the electrical, optical, and thermodynamic properties of solids. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct experimental probe of such electronic band structures, and so is widely employed in the study of functional, quantum, and 2D materials. \texttt{peaks} (\textbf{P}ython \textbf{E}lectron spectroscopy \textbf{A}nalysis by \textbf{K}ing group @ \textbf{S}t Andrews) provides a Python package for advanced data analysis of ARPES and related spectroscopic data. It facilitates the fast visualisation and analysis of multi-dimensional datasets, allows for the complex data hierarchy typical to ARPES experiments, and supports lazy data loading and parallel processing, reflecting the ever-increasing data volumes used in ARPES. It is designed to be run in an interactive notebook environment, with extensive inline and pop-out GUI support for data visualisation.</description>

      <title>Recombination of localized quasiparticles in disordered superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered superconductors offer new impedance regimes for quantum circuits, enable a pathway to protected qubits, and can improve superconducting detectors due to their high kinetic inductance and sheet resistance. The performance of these devices can be limited, however, by quasiparticles - the fundamental excitations of a superconductor. While experiments have shown that disorder affects the relaxation of quasiparticles drastically, the microscopic mechanisms are still not understood. We address this issue by measuring quasiparticle relaxation in a disordered $\beta$-Ta film, which we pattern as the inductor of a microwave resonator. We observe that quasiparticle recombination is governed by the phonon scattering time, which is faster than conventional recombination in ordered superconductors. We interpret the results as recombination of localized quasiparticles, induced by disorder, which first delocalize via phonon absorption. We analyze quasiparticle relaxation measurements on superconductors with different degrees of disorder and conclude that this phenomenon is inherent to disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature due to multiband effect in the topological nodal-line semimetal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic study of the normal-state and superconducting properties of single crystal Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$ $(0\leq x \leq 0.23)$. Sn doping enhances the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$ up to 5.1 K while also significantly increasing impurity scattering in the crystals. For $x=0$ and 0.018, the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ exceeds the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) weak-coupling value of 1.43, indicating the realization of strong-coupling superconductivity in undoped and slightly Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$. Substituting Pb with more Sn lowers the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$ below the BCS value of 1.43, which cannot be explained by a single-gap model. Rather, the observed specific heat data of moderately Sn-doped PbTaSe$_{2}$ ($x= 0.08$ and 0.15) are reproduced by a two-gap model. Our density functional theory calculations suggest that three-dimensional Fermi pockets appear due to a reduction of the spin-orbit gap with Sn doping, and the multiband effect arising from these emergent Fermi pockets enhances the effective electron-phonon coupling strength, leading to the increase in $T_{c}$ of Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$TaSe$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Band Structure and Pairing Nature of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, evidences of superconductivity (SC) with onset $T_c$ above the McMillan limit have been detected in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film grown on the LaSrAlO$_4$ substrate at ambient pressure. This progress opens a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Here we perform a density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculation for the band structure of this material. The obtained DFT+$U$ band structure has the feature that the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, forming the hole pocket $\gamma$, consistent with the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES). Taking the low-energy Ni-$(3d_{z^2},3d_{x^2-y^2})$ orbitals placed on the tetragonal lattice structure, we construct a 2D bilayer four-band tight-binding model which well captures the main features of the DFT+$U$ band structure. Then considering the multi-orbital Hubbard interaction, we adopt the random-phase approximation (RPA) approach to investigate the pairing nature. The obtained pairing symmetry is $s^{\pm}$ or $d_{xy}$ for the hole-doping level $\delta$ below or above 0.12, induced by the different Fermi surface nesting situations. For the realistic $\delta=0.21$ measured by the ARPES, our RPA calculations obtain the next-nearest-neighbor pairing $d_{xy}$-wave SC dominated by the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, consistent with the experimental observation that the $T_c$ enhances with the shrinking of the in-plane lattice constants. This pairing state is induced by the nesting between the different patches within the $\gamma$ pocket. Our results appeal for experimental verifications.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</description>

Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>
