      <title>Superconformal Monodromy Defects in $\mathcal{N}$=4 SYM and LS theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study type IIB supergravity solutions that are dual to two-dimensional superconformal defects in $d=4$ SCFTs which preserve $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ supersymmetry. We consider solutions dual to defects in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory that have non-trivial monodromy for $U(1)^3\subset SO(6)$ global symmetry and we also allow for the possibility of conical singularities. In addition, we consider the addition of fermionic and bosonic mass terms that have non trivial dependence on the spatial directions transverse to the defect, while preserving the superconformal symmetry of the defect. We compute various physical quantities including the central charges of the defect expressed as a function of the monodromy, the on-shell action as well as associated supersymmetric Renyi entropies. Analogous computations are carried out for superconformal defects in the $\mathcal{N}=1$, $d=4$ Leigh-Strassler SCFT. We also show that the defects of the two SCFTs are connected by a line of bulk marginal mass deformations and argue that they are also related by bulk RG flow.</description>

      <title>Excited Abelian-Higgs vortices: decay rate and radiation emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of 1-vortices when their massive bound mode is excited is investigated in detail (both analytically and numerically) in the Abelian-Higgs model for different ranges of the self-coupling constant. The dependence of the spectrum of the 1-vortex fluctuation operator on the model parameter is discussed initially. A perturbative approach is employed to study the radiation emission in both the scalar and the vector channels. Our findings reveal that the oscillating initial configuration of the 1-vortex radiates at a frequency twice that of the internal mode. Through energy conservation considerations, we derive the decay law of the massive mode. Finally, these analytical results are compared with numerical simulations in field theory.</description>

      <title>Domain walls in super Yang-Mills: worldvolume TQFTs and deconfinement from semiclassics on $\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{S}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies domain walls between chirally-separated vacua in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) on $\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{S}^1$ in the semiclassical limit. For all gauge groups we explicitly find the electric fluxes of all BPS domain walls and fully characterize the representation that they form under the global symmetry of SYM. We compute the characters of these representations formed by the semiclassical domain walls. We also compute these characters for the worldvolume TQFTs appearing in the literature for $SU(N)$ and $Sp(N)$ gauge groups. We find complete agreement between the two computations, providing thus a dynamical test of the proposed worldvolume TQFTs. We also propose a new worldvolume TQFT for $E_6$ domain walls, subjecting it to the same tests. Finally, we study deconfinement of quarks on domain walls for all gauge groups. We show that for all gauge groups confining strings (stable in the abelianized regime) can end on domain walls, regardless of whether or not the group has a center.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and electromagnetic effects on the phase transition of a zero spin bosonic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following paper, we will study a charged scalar field under an electromagnetic external field taking into account the spatial confining of the system. We shall use the Coleman-Weinberg method in one-loop approximation to obtain the effective potential of the model in the proper time representation. Through generalized Matsubara formalism, we applied several kinds of boundary conditions on the frontier of the system. The regularization of the model is performed by a scheme independent of the external electromagnetic applied field. The model presents phase transition and we carry out its analysis by the free energy density functional of the bosonic system. The findings show magnetic catalysis, electric catalysis, and inverse electric catalysis phenomena, all of them depending on the thickness of the system.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Flow of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the renormalization flow of generic actions that depend on the invariants of the field strength tensor of an abelian gauge field. While the Maxwell action defines a Gaussian fixed point, we search for further non-Gaussian fixed points or rather fixed functions, i.e., globally existing Lagrangians of the invariants. Using standard small-field expansion techniques for the resulting functional flow equation, a large number of fixed points is obtained, which - in analogy to recent findings for a shift-symmetric scalar field - we consider as approximation artifacts. For the construction of a globally existing fixed function, we pay attention to the use of proper initial conditions. Parametrizing the latter by the photon anomalous dimension, both the coefficients of the weak-field expansion are fully determined and those of the large-field expansion can be matched such that a global fixed function can be constructed for magnetic fields. The anomalous dimension also governs the strong-field limit. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a continuum of non-Gaussian fixed points parametrized by a small positive anomalous dimension below a critical value. We discuss the implications of this result within various scenarios with and without additional matter. For the strong-field limit of the 1PI QED effective action, where the anomalous dimension is determined by electronic fluctuations, our result suggests the existence of a singularity free strong-field limit, circumventing the standard conclusions connected to the perturbative Landau pole.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Dynamics and Critical Phenomena in the Holographic Landscape of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes critical exponents in a holographic Weyl semi-metal (WSM) using the $D3/D7$ brane setup. We study the non-linear behavior of the longitudinal current $J$ interacting with an external electric field $E$ at zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we identify a potential quantum phase transition in the $J$-$E$ relationship driven by critical background parameters. At zero temperature, we pinpoint a potential quantum phase transition in the $J$-$E$ relationship, driven by a critical ratio of background parameters. This transition is a unique reconnection phenomenon, emerging from the interplay between WSM-like and ordinary nonlinear conducting behaviors, signaling a quantum phase transition. At nonzero temperature, with dissipation, the system exhibits both first- and second-order phase transitions by varying the electric field and the axial anomaly. We introduce longitudinal conductivity as an order parameter for the current-driven phase transition. Remarkably, our numerical analysis indicates critical exponents in this non-equilibrium phase transition that resemble the mean-field values found in metallic systems. This study sheds light on critical phenomena in non-equilibrium states, offering new insights into the quantum critical behavior of holographic systems and the nonlinear dynamics in WSMs, with broader implications for quantum phase transitions in condensed matter physics and topological materials.</description>

      <title>Holographic RG flows in a 3d gauged supergravity at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider finite-temperature holographic RG flows in $D=3$ $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ gauged truncated supergravity coupled to a sigma model with a hyperbolic target space. In the context of the holographic duality, fixed points (CFTs) at finite temperature are described by AdS black holes. We come from the gravity EOM to a 3d autonomous dynamical system, which critical points can be related to fixed points of dual field theories. Near-horizon black hole solutions correspond to infinite points of this system. We use Poincar\'e transformations to project the system on $\mathbf{R}^3$ into the 3d unit cylinder such that the infinite points are mapped onto the boundary of the cylinder. We explore numerically the space of solutions. We show that the exact RG flow at zero temperature is the separatrix for asymptotically AdS black hole solutions if the potential has one extremum, while for the potential with three extrema the separatrices are RG flows between AdS fixed points. We find near-horizon analytical solutions for asymptotically AdS black holes using the dynamical equations. We also present a method for constructing full analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Intersecting Branes, Newton-Cartan Geometry and AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss non-relativistic variants of four-dimensional ${\cal N}$=4 super-Yang-Mills theory obtained from generalised Newton-Cartan geometric limits of D3-branes in ten-dimensional spacetime. We argue that the natural interpretation of these limits is that they correspond to non-relativistic D1-branes or D3-branes intersecting the original D3-branes. The resulting gauge theories have dynamics that reduce to quantum mechanics on monopole moduli space or two-dimensional sigma-models on Hitchin moduli space respectively. We show that these theories possess interesting infinite-dimensional symmetries and we discuss the dual $AdS$ geometries.</description>

      <title>Generalised Hydrodynamics of $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$-Deformed Integrable Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the averages of conserved densities and currents associated to charges of generic spin in (1+1)-dimensional massive integrable Quantum Field Theories perturbed by the irrelevant $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ operator. By making use of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach and of the theory of Generalised Hydrodynamics, we study the non-equilibrium steady state averages of conserved densities and currents in a partitioning protocol. We show that in particular limits, averages can be evaluated exactly in terms of quantities known from the unperturbed theory. In the massless limit we recover known results for the energy and momentum currents and generalise those to any higher spin conserved quantities. We extend some of our results to perturbations of the generalised $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ type. For the massive free fermion theory, we find an analytic expression for the effective inverse temperature after at $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ perturbation in terms of the bare inverse temperature by making use of Lambert's $W$ function.</description>

      <title>Charge (in)stability and superradiance of Topological Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear massive scalar charged perturbations of Topological Stars in the fuzzball and in the black hole (Black String) regimes. The objects that naturally couple to the electric 3-form field strength of these solutions are charged strings, wound around the compact direction. We explore the possibility of instabilities of these solutions, in analogy with the charge instability already highlighted for other non-BPS geometries like JMaRT. This issue is addressed by calculating quasi-normal mode frequencies with a variety of techniques: WKB approximation, direct integration, Leaver method and by exploiting the recently discovered correspondence between black hole-fuzzball perturbation theory and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves. All mode frequencies we find have negative imaginary parts, implying an exponential decay in time. This suggests a linear stability of Topological Stars also in this new scenario. In addition, we study the charge superradiance for the Black String. We compute the amplification factor with the numerical integration method and a quantum Seiberg-Witten motivated definition including instantonic corrections.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Q-balls: from spectral structure to radiation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Q-balls in a 1+1 dimensional complex scalar field theory. We find that the relaxation of a squashed Q-ball is dominated by the decay of a normal mode through nonlinear coupling to scattering modes and a long-lasting quasi-normal mode. We also study how these Q-balls behave when exposed to scalar radiation, finding that for certain conditions they can experience negative radiation pressure.</description>

      <title>The Non-Invertible Axial Symmetry in QED Comes Full Circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the possibility of constructing non-invertible topological defects for the axial symmetry of massless QED, despite its ABJ anomaly. Dressing the defects with a topological quantum field theory with mixed $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{R}$-valued gauge fields, we are able to describe axial rotations of any rational or irrational angle. We confront our results with the existing proposals, in particular those that concern rational angles. We also provide the Symmetry TFT that reproduces the action of all such symmetry defects of QED. Finally, we discuss how similar techniques allow the study of condensation defects for a $\mathbb{R}$ global symmetry.</description>

      <title>A General Hierarchy of Charges at Null Infinity via the Todd Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a general procedure for constructing an extended phase space for Yang-Mills theory at null infinity, capable of handling the asymptotic symmetries and construction of charges responsible for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems at all orders. The procedure is coordinate and gauge-choice independent, and can be fed into the calculation of both tree and loop-level soft limits. We find a hierarchy in the extended phase space controlled by the Bernoulli numbers arising in Todd genus computations. We give an explicit example of a calculation at tree level, in radial gauge, where we also uncover recursion relations at all orders for the equations of motion and charges.</description>

      <title>A review of wormhole stabilization in f(R) gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proven that in standard Einstein gravity, exotic matter (i.e. matter violating the point-wise and averaged weak and null energy conditions) is required to stabilize traversable wormholes. Quantum field theory permits these violations due to the quantum coherent effects found in any quantum field [1]. Even reasonable classical scalar fields violate the energy conditions. In the case of the Casimir effect and squeezed vacuum states, these violations have been experimentally proven. It is advantageous to investigate methods of minimizing the use of exotic matter. One such area of interest is extended theories of Einstein gravity. It has been claimed that in some extended theories, stable traversable wormholes solutions can be found without the use of exotic matter. There are many extended theories of gravity and in this review paper we first explore f(R) theories and then explore some wormhole solutions in f(R) theories including Lovelock gravity.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian Renormalization of Neural Network Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the Gaussian Process in which the data plays the role of the energy scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and identify potential universality classes in these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic quasi-normal modes, generated at second order in black hole perturbation theory, are a promising target for testing gravity in the nonlinear regime with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. While their frequencies have long been known, their amplitudes remain poorly studied. We introduce regular variables and compute amplitudes for Schwarzschild black holes with the Leaver algorithm. We find a nonlinear ratio $\mathcal{R}\simeq0.154e^{-0.068i}$ for the most excited $\ell=4$ mode, matching results from Numerical Relativity. We also predict new low-frequency $\ell=2$ quadratic modes.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using quantum singular value transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science and fundamental physics. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation, which significantly extends an approach by Yoshida and Kitaev in a specific noise model to general situations. We also show that the proposed decoding circuits reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder. Our constructions not only show an intriguing intersection between decoders and quantum algorithms but also reveal the power of an algorithmic approach to recovering quantum information.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Bootstrap: Using Transformers to Compute Scattering Amplitudes in Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the use of deep learning methods to improve state-of-the-art computations in theoretical high-energy physics. Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory is a close cousin to the theory that describes Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider; its scattering amplitudes are large mathematical expressions containing integer coefficients. In this paper, we apply Transformers to predict these coefficients. The problem can be formulated in a language-like representation amenable to standard cross-entropy training objectives. We design two related experiments and show that the model achieves high accuracy (&gt; 98%) on both tasks. Our work shows that Transformers can be applied successfully to problems in theoretical physics that require exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Unconstrained Gravity and Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the quantum description of gauge theories, we study the cosmological effects of relaxing the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints in general relativity and Gauss' law in electromagnetism. We show that the unconstrained theories have new source terms that mimic a pressureless dust and a charge density that only follows geodesics. The source terms may be the simplest explanation for dark matter and generically predict a charged component. We comment that discovery of such terms would rule out inflation and be a direct probe of the initial conditions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Frequencies of Fields with Various Spin in the Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Model of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent development involves an intriguing model of a quantum-corrected black hole, established through the application of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model within loop quantum cosmology [Lewandowski et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 (2023) 10, 101501]. Employing both time-domain integration and the WKB approach, we compute the quasinormal frequencies for scalar, electromagnetic, and neutrino perturbations in these quantum-corrected black holes. Our analysis reveals that while the real oscillation frequencies undergo only minor adjustments due to the quantum parameter, the damping rate experiences a significant decrease as a result of its influence. We also deduce the analytic formula for quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit and show that the correspondence between the null geodesics and eikoanl quasinormal modes holds in this case.</description>

      <title>Gravitating Scalarons with Inverted Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, a class of regular and asymptotically flat gravitating scalar solitons (scalarons) has been constructed in the Einstein--Klein--Gordon (EKG) theory by adopting a phantom field with Higgs-like potential where the kinetic term has the wrong sign and the scalaron possesses the negative Arnowitt--Deser--Misner (ADM) mass as a consequence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the use of the phantom field can be avoided by inverting the Higgs-like potential in the EKG system when the kinetic term has a proper sign, such that the corresponding gravitating scalaron can possess the positive ADM mass. We systematically study the basic properties of the gravitating scalaron, such as the ADM mass, the energy conditions, the geodesics of test particles, etc. Moreover, we find that it can be smoothly connected to the counterpart hairy black hole solutions from our recent work in the small horizon limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new classes of inflation models based on the modular symmetry, where the modulus field $\tau$ serves as the inflaton. We establish a connection between modular inflation and modular stabilization, wherein the modulus field rolls towards a fixed point along the boundary of the fundamental domain. We find the modular symmetry strongly constrain the possible shape of the potential and identify some parameter space where the inflation predictions agree with cosmic microwave background observations. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be smaller than $10^{-6}$ in our models, while the running of spectral index is of the the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study interaction between dark energy and dark matter, where dark energy is described by a massive vector field, and dark matter is modelled as a fluid. We present new interaction term, which affects only perturbations and can give interesting phenomenology. Then we present a general Lagrangian for the interacting vector dark energy with dark matter. For the dark energy, we choose Proca theory with $G_{3}$ term to study its phenomenological consequence. For this model, we explore both background and perturbation dynamics. We also present the no-ghost condition for tensor modes and scalar modes. Subsequently, we also study the evolution of the overdensities of both baryon and cold dark matter in the high$-k$ limit. We show that the effective gravitational coupling is modified for cold dark matter and baryon. We also choose a simple concrete model and numerically show a suppression in the growth of cold dark matter overdensity.</description>

      <title>The Role of Topological Photon Spheres in Constraining the Parameters of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological photon sphere from two distinct perspectives. In the first view, we examine the existence and characteristics of topological photon(anti-photon)spheres for black holes with different structures, such as Einstein-Young-Mills non-minimal, AdS black holes surrounded by Chaplygin-like dark fluid, and Bardeen-like black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Furthermore, we delve into the deeper perspective of the necessity of photon spheres for super-compact gravitational structures such as black holes. By leveraging this necessity, we propose a classification of the parameter space of black hole models based on the existence and positioning of photon spheres. This approach enables the determination of parameter ranges that delineate whether a solution represents a black hole or a naked singularity. In essence, the paper illustrates the utility of the photon sphere as a notable test for establishing the permissible and non-permissible parameter ranges within specific theories of black hole solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics is living an era of unprecedented cross-fertilization among the different areas of science. In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that ultracold-atom quantum technologies can have in fundamental and applied science through platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. We take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e. creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum computer to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We convey three main messages. First, atomic quantum technologies have enabled a new way in which quantum technologies are used for fundamental science, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is taking the center stage in frontier's science. Third, quantum science progress will have capillary impact on society. Thus, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all these reflections, this perspective review is aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectral Shapes as test for Low-Scale Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermal and non-thermal resonant leptogenesis in a general setting where a heavy scalar $\phi$ decays to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) whose further out-of-equilibrium decay generates the required lepton asymmetry. Domination of the energy budget of the Universe by the $\phi$ or the RHNs alters the evolution history of the primordial gravitational waves (PGW), of inflationary origin, which re-enter the horizon after inflation, modifying the spectral shape. The decays of $\phi$ and RHNs release entropy into the early Universe while nearly degenerate RHNs facilitate low and intermediate scale leptogenesis. We show that depending on the coupling $y_R$ of $\phi$ to radiation species, RHNs can achieve thermal abundance before decaying, which gives rise to thermal leptogenesis. A characteristic damping of the GW spectrum resulting in two knee-like features or one knee-like feature would provide evidence for low-scale thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis respectively. We explore the parameter space for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1\in[10^2,10^{14}]$ GeV and washout parameter $K$ that depends on the light-heavy neutrino Yukawa couplings $\lambda$, in the weak ($K &lt; 1$) and strong ($K &gt; 1$) washout regimes. The resulting novel features compatible with observed baryon asymmetry are detectable by future experiments like LISA and ET. By estimating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for upcoming GW experiments, we investigate the effect of the scalar mass $M_\phi$ and reheating temperature $T_\phi$, which depends on the $\phi-N$ Yukawa couplings $y_N$.</description>

Abstract: We present expressions for correlation functions of scalar field theories in perturbation theory using quantum $A_\infty$ algebras. Our expressions are highly explicit and can be used for theories both in Euclidean space and in Minkowski space including quantum mechanics. Correlation functions at a given order of perturbation theory can be calculated algebraically without using canonical quantization or the path integral, and we demonstrate it explicitly for $\varphi^3$ theory. We show that the Schwinger-Dyson equations are satisfied as an immediate consequence of the form of the expressions based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras.</description>

Abstract: A variety of condensed matter systems describe gapless modes that can be interpreted as Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken Poincar\'e symmetry. In this paper we derive new soft theorems constraining the tree-level scattering of these degrees of freedom, as exhibited in solids, fluids, superfluids, and framids. These soft theorems are in one-to-one correspondence with various broken symmetries, including spacetime translations, Lorentz boosts, and, for the case of fluids, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. We also implement a bootstrap in which the enhanced vanishing of amplitudes in the soft limit is taken as an input, thus sculpting out a subclass of exceptional solid, fluid, and framid theories.</description>

      <title>On a class of fusion 2-category symmetry: condensation completion of braided fusion category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many studies are focused on generalized global symmetry, a mixture of both invertible and non-invertible symmetries in various space-time dimensions. The complete structure of generalized global symmetry is described by higher fusion category theory. In this paper, We first review the construction of fusion 2-category symmetry $\Sigma \cal B$ where $\cal B$ is a a braided fusion category. In particular, we elaborate on the monoidal structure of $\Sigma \cal B$ which determines fusion rules and controls the dynamics of topological operators/defects. We then take $\Sigma \mathrm{sVec}$ as an example to demonstrate how we calculate fusion rule, quantum dimension and 10j-symbol of the fusion 2-category. With our algorithm, all these data can be efficiently encoded and computed in computer program. The complete program will be uploaded to github soon. Our work can be thought as explicitly computing the representation theory of $\cal B$, in analogy to, for example the representation theory of $SU(2)$. The choice of basis bimodule maps are in analogy to the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and the 10j-symbol are in analogy to the 6j-symbol.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry of $T\bar{T}$-deformed BTZ black hole and find it can be regarded as a quotient of hyperbolic space. We then consider the massive scalar field propagating in the $T\bar{T}$-deformed BTZ black hole background. The one-loop partition function of scalar field is calculated using the heat kernel method and the Wilson spool proposal. These two methods give consistent result which implies the Wilson spool proposal still holds under $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Moreover, we also calculate the one-loop partition function of graviton in $T\bar{T}$-deformed BTZ black hole. We find the deformed one-loop partition functions are modified in a simple way, which corresponds to a replacement of the modular parameter. The result precisely matches the large $c$ expansion of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT partition function. These results provide a further check about the correspondence between $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT$_2$ and AdS$_3$ with mixed boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Towards multiloop local renormalization within Causal Loop-Tree Duality</title>

Abstract: Renormalization is a well-known technique to get rid of ultraviolet (UV) singularities. When relying on Dimensional Regularization (DREG), these become manifest as $\epsilon$-poles, allowing to define counter-terms with useful recursive properties. However, this procedure requires to work at \emph{integral-level} and poses difficulties to achieve a smooth combination with semi-numerical approaches. This article is devoted to the development of an integrand-level renormalization formalism, better suited for semi or fully numerical calculations. Starting from the Loop-Tree Duality (LTD), we keep the causal representations of the integrands of multiloop Feynman diagrams and explore their UV behaviour. Then, we propose a strategy that allows to build local counter-terms, capable of rendering the expressions integrable in the high-energy limit and in four space-time dimensions. Our procedure was tested on diagrams up to three-loops, and we found a remarkably smooth cancellation of divergences. The results of this work constitute a powerful step towards a fully local renormalization framework in QFT.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Symmetry Preserving Gapped Phases from Coupling Constant Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we will characterize constraints on the possible IR phases of a given QFT by anomalies in the space of coupling constants. We will give conditions under which a coupling constant anomaly cannot be matched by a continuous family of symmetry preserving gapped phases, in which case the theory is either gapless, or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking or a phase transition. We additionally demonstrate examples of theories with coupling constant anomalies which can be matched by a family of symmetry preserving gapped phases without a phase transition and comment on the interpretation of our results for the spontaneous breaking of "$(-1)$-form global symmetries."</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Lagrangian Formulation for Bosonic Continuous Spin Theory in Flat Spacetime of Arbitrary Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discovered two unconstrained forms of free Lagrangian for continuous spin(CS) theory in arbitrary flat spacetime dimension for bosonic case. These Lagrangians, unlike that by Schuster and Toro, do not include delta functions and are conventional. The first form consists of five kinds of totally symmetric helicity fields and one kind of gauge parameter. By introducing auxiliary creation and annihilation operators, each is combined into a state vector in Fock space, including all ranks one by one. The Lagrangian imposes no constraints, such as trace conditions, on these fields or the gauge parameter field. Additionally, the Lagrangian does not contain higher-order derivative terms. In the limit as CS parameter $\mu$ approaches zero, it naturally reproduces a Lagrangian for helicity fields in higher spin(HS) theory, known as unconstrained quartet formulation. Permitting third-order derivatives, we also obtain the second unconstrained form of Lagrangian that can be written in terms of three kinds of fields, including $\mu$, similar to the formulation by Francia and Sagnotti. Partial gauge fixing and partial use of equation of motion(EOM) on this Lagrangian yield a Fronsdal-like Lagrangian with a single double-traceless field, including $\mu$. By imposing further gauge fixing on the field in the EOM with respect to divergence and trace, we confirm the reproduction of the modified Wigner equations already known in literature.</description>

Abstract: But if you treat it as a two-form, you get three nontrivial renormalization group fixed points! Which becomes the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions? Motivated by this question, we study the conformal bootstrap constraint in the $O(d)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d$ dimensions, varying $d$ as a continuous parameter. Besides the one that is naturally connected to the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions, we find "evanescent" kinks whose origin is yet to be identified. We also bootstrap $O(4), O(5), O(6)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d=3$, aiming at physical applications.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents and geodesic stability of Schwarzschild black hole in the non-commutative gauge theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of geodesic motion for both massive and massless particles using Lyapunov exponents in the non-commutative (NC) Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) via the gauge theory of gravity. As a first step, we investigate the both time-like and null radial motion of particles, the mean result in NC geometry shows that the particles take infinity proper time to reach the NC singularity (infinite time affine parameter framework for photons). The proper/coordinate time of Lyapunov exponents and their ratio of time-like geodesic for the circular motion of this black hole shows a new behavior, which describes a new range of stable circular orbits between unstable ones. Then we analyze the circular motion of photons, where the result shows a new photon sphere near the event horizon which is not allowed in the commutative case, and the Lyapunov exponent is expressed in this geometry, where this confirms the instability of the outer photon sphere and the stability of the inner one. Finally, we check the effect of the non-commutativity on the shadow radius of the SBH, where we show the similarity between the non-commutativity and the black hole mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transonic fluid flow generates an acoustic hole that is the hydrodynamic analogue of a gravitational black hole. Acoustic holes emit a detectable thermal radiation of phonons at a characteristic Hawking temperature. The crucial concept is that the spontaneous phonon emission at the horizon produces an irreversible heat increase at the expenses of the bulk fluid kinetic energy. We show that such process can be described in terms of \textit{effective} shear and bulk viscosities that are defined close to the horizon. We analyze this quantum friction process by resorting to a general kinetic theory approach as well as by the specific description of phonon emission as a tunneling process. The celebrated Kovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS) universal lower bound $\eta /s = 1 / 4 \pi $ of the shear viscosity coefficient to entropy density ratio, readily follows, and is extended to the longitudinal bulk viscosity at the horizon. We come to the same saturation of the KSS bound after considering the shear viscosity arising from a perturbation of the background metric at the acoustic horizon providing a -- in principle testable -- realization of the so called black hole \textit{membrane paradigm}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a novel phenomenon in the solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation by solving numerically the equation assuming $O(4)$-symmetry and imposing the Hartle-Hawking wave function as a boundary condition. In the slow-roll limit, as expected, the numerical solution gives the most dominant steepest-descent that describes the probability distribution for the initial condition of a universe. The probability is consistent with the Euclidean computations, and the overall shape of the wave function is compatible with analytical approximations, although there exist novel differences in the detailed probability computation. Our approach gives an alternative point of view of the no-boundary wave function from the wave function point of view. Possible interpretations and conceptual issues of this wave function are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a realistic mechanism whereby black holes with significant QCD color charge could have formed during the early universe. Primordial black holes (PBHs) could make up a significant fraction of the dark matter if they formed well before the QCD confinement transition. Such PBHs would form by absorbing unconfined quarks and gluons, and hence could acquire a net color charge. We estimate the number of PBHs per Hubble volume with near-extremal color charge for various scenarios, and discuss possible phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>The merger rate of primordial black hole binaries as a probe of Hubble parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be a probe of Hubble parameter by constraining PBH mass function in the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries. In next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, the GWs from PBH binaries would be detected at high redshifts, which gives their redshifted mass and luminosity distances. From a number of detected events, the redshifted mass distribution of PBH binaries can be statistically obtained, and it depends on PBH mass function and redshift distribution of detected PBH binaries. The PBH mass function can be inversely solved by applying the gradient descent method in the relation between redshifted mass distribution and redshift distribution. However, the construction of redshift distribution requires an assumed Hubble parameter in a background cosmology to extract redshift from luminosity distances, which causes solved PBH mass function also depends on assumed Hubble parameter. To determine the Hubble parameter, the merger rate of PBH binaries constrains on this Hubble parameter-dependent PBH mass function by comparing calculated merger rate distribution with observed one, and the best-fit result produces an approximate mass distribution of the physical PBH mass function and pins down the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>Geodesic structure, shadow and optical appearance of black hole immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on a black hole immersed in a cosmological Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), characterized by the equation of state $p=-B/\rho$ and an additional parameter $q$ influencing the energy density of the fluid. We investigate the geodesic structure, shadow, and optical appearance of such a black hole. Through analysis on the effective potential and the epicyclic frequencies, it is found that the existence of innermost/outermost stable circular orbits for a timelike particle is governed by the CDF parameters. The behaviors of the orbital conserved quantities and Keplerian frequency are also examined. Due to the existence of pseudo-cosmological horizon, the determination of the shadow radius depends significantly on the position of the observer. By placing the static observer at an approximately flat position between the event and pseudo-cosmological horizons, we constrain the CDF parameters using EHT observations. We investigate the effect of CDF on the shadows and optical images of the black hole, surrounded by various profiles of accretions. For the thin disk accretion, the light trajectories are categorized into direct emission, lensing ring, and photon ring based on impact parameters. Due to the existence of outermost stable circular orbits, outer edges could exist in the direct and lensing ring images. The observed brightness is mainly due to direct emission, with a minor contribution from the lensing ring, while the contribution from the photon ring is negligible due to extreme demagnetization. In the case of spherical accretion, we consider both static and infalling accretion models. The images obtained under infalling accretion are slightly darker than those under static accretion, attributed to the Doppler effect. Throughout the study, we analyze the influence of the parameters $B$ and $q$ on the results.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\theta$-dependence of the string tension and of the lightest glueball mass in four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories. More precisely, we focus on the coefficients parametrizing the $\mathcal{O}(\theta^2)$ dependence of these quantities, which we investigate by means of numerical simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, carried out using imaginary values of the $\theta$ parameter. Topological freezing at large $N$ is avoided using the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions algorithm. We provide controlled continuum extrapolations of such coefficients in the $N=3$ case, and we report the results obtained on two fairly fine lattice spacings for $N=6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At first glance, thermodynamic properties of gravity with asymptotically AdS conditions and those with box boundary conditions, where the spatial section of the boundary is a sphere of finite radius, appear similar. Both exhibit a similar phase structure and Hawking-Page phase transition. However, when we introduce a U(1) gauge field to the system, discrepancies in thermodynamic properties between the two cases has been reported in [7] (JHEP 11 (2016) 041). In this paper, by accepting the assumption that all Euclidean saddles contribute to the partition function, I found that these discrepancies are resolved due to the contribution from the "bag of gold (BG)," which is the class of Euclidean geometries whose area of bolt is bigger than that of the boundary. As a result, the Hawking-Page phase structure is restored, with the unexpected properties that the upper bound of thermodynamic entropy is always larger than the boundary area divided by 4G when the chemical potential is non-zero, and that such high entropy states are realized at sufficiently high temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, I studied the thermodynamical properties of the Einstein-Maxwell system with a box boundary in 4-dimensions [1](JHEP 04 (2024) 083). In this paper, I investigate those in 3-dimensions using the zero-loop saddle-point approximation and focusing only on a simple topology sector as usual. Similar to the 4-dimensional case, the system is thermodynamically well-behaved when $\Lambda&lt;0$ (due to the contribution of the "bag of gold" saddles). However, when $\Lambda=0$, a crucial difference to the 4-dimensional case appears, i.e. the 3-dimensional system turns out to be thermodynamically unstable, while the 4-dimensional one is thermodynamically stable. This may offer two options for how we think about the thermodynamics of 3-dimensional gravity with $\Lambda=0$. One is that the zero-loop approximation or restricting the simple topology sector is not sufficient for 3-dimensions with $\Lambda=0$. The other is that 3-dimensional gravity is really thermodynamically unstable when $\Lambda=0$.</description>

Abstract: We present a study on the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave generated by coalescing spinless binary systems up to the third post-Minkowskian approximation in the effective one-body theory. To derive an analytical expansion of the null tetrad components of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor $\varPsi_{4}$ in the effective spacetime, we utilize the method proposed by Sasaki $et$ $al.$ During this investigation, we discover more general integral formulas that provide a theoretical framework for computing the results in any order. Subsequently, we successfully compute the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave, which include the results of the Schwarzschild case and the correction terms resulting from the dimensionless parameters $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$ in the effective metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation can be derived assuming the Galilean covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>
