      <title>Harmonic measures and rigidity for transverse foliations on Seifert $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thurston proposed, in part of an unfinished manuscript, to study surface group actions on $S^1$ by using an $S^1$-connection on the suspension bundle obtained from a harmonic measure. Following the approach and previous work of the authors, we study the actions of general lattices of $\mathrm{PSU}(1,1)$ on $S^1$. We prove the Gauss--Bonnet formula for the $S^1$-connection associated with a harmonic measure, and show that a harmonic measure on the suspension bundle of the action with maximal Euler number has rigidity, having a form closely related to the Poisson kernel. As an application, we prove a semiconjugacy rigidity for foliations with maximal Euler number, which is analogous to theorems due to Matsumoto, Minakawa and Burger--Iozzi--Wienhard.</description>

      <title>Every non-trivial knot group is fully residually perfect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a class $\mathcal{P}$ of groups we say that a group $G$ is fully residually $\mathcal{P}$ if for any finite subset $F$ of $G$, there exists an epimorphism from $G$ to a group in $\mathcal{P}$ which is injective on $F$. It is known that any non-trivial knot group is fully residually finite. For hyperbolic knots, its knot group is fully residually closed hyperbolic $3$--manifold group, and fully residually simple. In this article, we show that every non-trivial knot group is fully residually perfect, closed $3$--manifold group.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev polynomials and Gram determinants from the M\"obius band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the connection between Chebyshev polynomials and knot theory, specifically in relation to Gram determinants. We reveal intriguing formulae involving the Chebyshev polynomial of the first and second kind. In particular we show that for Mersenne numbers, $M_k=2^k-1$ where $k\geq 2$, the $M_k$-th Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind is the product of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. We then discuss the Gram determinant of type $(Mb)_1$, restate the conjecture of its closed formula in terms of mostly products of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, and prove a factor of the determinant that supports the conjecture. We also showcase an algorithm for calculating the Gram determinant's corresponding matrix. Furthermore, we restate Qi Chen's conjectured closed formula for the Gram determinant of type Mb and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Contact homology of contact manifolds and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16540v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a survey of contact homology and its applications to the study of contact manifolds. It is a small tribute to Yasha Eliashberg's huge generosity with his countless explanations of his deep mathematical insights all along his career. It is also the author's wishful thinking that this text could be useful to students and young mathematicians for learning about some of the holomorphic curves based invariants in contact geometry.</description>

      <title>Non collapse of the Sinha spectral sequence for knots in R^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit description up to the third page of the Sinha homology mod 2 spectral sequence for the space of long knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$, that is conjecturally equivalent to the Vassiliev spectral sequence. The description arises from a multicomplex structure on the Fox Neuwirth chain complexes for euclidean configuration spaces. A computer assisted calculation reveals a non trivial third page differential from a 2-dimensional class, in contrast to the rational case.</description>

      <title>The Morse-Smale Property of the Thurston Spine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Thurston spine consists of the subset of Teichm\"uller space at which the set of shortest curves, the systoles, cuts the surface into polygons. The systole function is a topological Morse function on Teichm\"uller space. This paper studies the local properties of the Thurston spine, and the smooth pieces out of which it is constructed. Some of these local properties are shown to have global consequences, for example that the Thurston spine satisfies properties defined in terms of the systole function analogous to that of Morse-Smale complexes of (smooth) Morse functions on compact manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Complexity of equal 0-surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that two knots are friends if they share the same 0-surgery. Two friends with different sliceness status would provide a counterexample to the 4-dimensional smooth Poincar\'e conjecture. Here we create a census of all friends with small crossing numbers c and tetrahedral complexities t, and compute their smooth 4-genera. In particular, we compute the minimum of c(K)+c(K') and of t(K)+t(K') among all friends K and K'. Along the way, we classify all 0-surgeries of knots of at most 15 crossings.
  Moreover, we determine for many friends in our census if their traces are equivalent or not. For that, we develop a new obstruction for two traces being homeomorphic coming from symmetry-exceptional slopes of hyperbolic knots. This is enough to also determine the minimum value of c(K)+c(K') among all friends K and K' whose traces are not homeomorphic.</description>

      <title>On the Euler class one conjecture for fillable contact structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, it is proved that every oriented closed hyperbolic $3$--manifold $N$ admits some finite cover $M$ with the following property. There exists some even lattice point $w$ on the boundary of the dual Thurston norm unit ball of $M$, such that $w$ is not the real Euler class of any weakly symplectically fillable contact structure on $M$. In particular, $w$ is not the real Euler class of any transversely oriented, taut foliation on $M$. This supplies new counter-examples to Thurston's Euler class one conjecture.</description>

      <title>The geometry of totally geodesic subvarieties of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a semisimplicity result for the boundary, in the corresponding Deligne-Mumford compactification, of a totally geodesic subvariety of a moduli space of Riemann surfaces. At the level of Teichm\"uller space, this semisimplicity theorem gives that each component of the boundary is a product of simple factors, each of which behaves metrically like a diagonal embedding. Building on this result, we also show that the associated totally geodesic submanifolds of Teichm\"uller space and orbifold fundamental groups are hierarchically hyperbolic.
  The proof intertwines in a novel way results and perspectives originating in dynamics, algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and both classical and modern Teichm\"uller theory. It establishes both new rigidity and new flexibility for totally geodesic submanifolds and their associated varieties and orbifold fundamental groups and provides a rich set of new tools for the study of these objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of unlikely intersections for automorphisms of Markov surfaces of positive entropy. We show for certain parameters that two automorphisms with positive entropy share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they share a common iterate. Our proof uses arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties, the theory of laminar currents and quasi-Fuchsian representation theory.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>Maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in the 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$, whose parametrization space can be identified with the cotangent bundle $T^*T_0(1)$ of Weil-Petersson universal Teichm\"uller space $T_0(1)$. We prove that the Mess map defines a symplectic diffeomorphism from $T^*T_0(1)$ to $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$, with respect to the canonical symplectic form on $T^*T_0(1)$ and the difference of pullbacks of the Weil-Petersson symplectic forms from each factor of $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$. Furthermore, we show that the functional given by the anti-holomorphic energies of the induced Gauss maps associated with maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class serves as a K\"ahler potential for the restriction of the canonical symplectic form to certain submanifolds $T_0(1)^\pm \subset T^*T_0(1)$, which bijectively parametrize the space of maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$.</description>
