      <title>Estimating the housing production function with unobserved land heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel method for estimating the housing production function that addresses transmission bias caused by unobserved heterogeneity in land productivity. The approach builds on the nonparametric identification strategy of Gandhi et al. (2020) and exploits the zero-profit condition to allow consistent estimation even when either capital input or housing value is unobserved, under the assumption that land productivity follows a Markov process. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the estimator performs well across a variety of production technologies.</description>

      <title>GDP-GFCF Dynamics Across Global Economies: A Comparative Study of Panel Regressions and Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between GDP growth and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) across developed economies (G7, EU-15, OECD) and emerging markets (BRICS). We integrate Random Forest machine learning (non-linear regression) with traditional econometric models (linear regression) to better capture non-linear interactions in investment analysis. Our findings reveal that while GDP growth positively influences corporate investment, its impact varies significantly by region. Developed economies show stronger GDP-GFCF linkages due to stable financial systems, while emerging markets demonstrate weaker connections due to economic heterogeneity and structural constraints. Random Forest models indicate that GDP growth's importance is lower than suggested by traditional econometrics, with lagged GFCF emerging as the dominant predictor-confirming investment follows path-dependent patterns rather than short-term GDP fluctuations. Regional variations in investment drivers are substantial: taxation significantly influences developed economies but minimally affects BRICS, while unemployment strongly drives investment in BRICS but less so elsewhere. We introduce a parallelized p-value importance algorithm for Random Forest that enhances computational efficiency while maintaining statistical rigor through sequential testing methods (SPRT and SAPT). The research demonstrates that hybrid methodologies combining machine learning with econometric techniques provide more nuanced understanding of investment dynamics, supporting region-specific policy design and improving forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>The environmental value of transport infrastructure in the UK: an EXIOBASE analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to calculate a project s environmental value are described: (a) process-based, (b) hybrid, (c) pseudo, (d) simplified, and (e) parametric. This paper discusses in detail and compares the two methods with the least inherent uncertainty: process-based LCA (a bottom-up methodology involving mapping and characterising all processes associated with all life cycle phases of a project) and a hybrid LCA (the EXIOBASE analysis, which incorporates top-down economic input output analysis and is a wider sector-by-sector approach). The bottom-up nature of process-based LCA, which quantifies the environmental impacts for each process in all life cycle phases of a project, is particularly challenging when applied to the evaluation of infrastructure as a whole. Conversely, combining the environmental impact information provided in EXIOBASE tables with the corresponding input output tables allows decision makers to more straightforwardly choose to invest in infrastructure that supports positive environmental outcomes. Employing LCA and a bespoke model using Pearson s correlation coefficient to capture environmental interdependencies between the transport sector and the other four economic infrastructures showed the transport and energy sectors to be most closely linked. Both integrated planning and innovative technologies are needed to radically reduce adverse environmental impacts and enhance sustainability across transport, waste, water, and communication sectors.</description>

      <title>Exploring AI-powered Digital Innovations from A Transnational Governance Perspective: Implications for Market Acceptance and Digital Accountability Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to AI-powered digital innovations within a transnational governance framework. By integrating Latourian actor-network theory (ANT), this study examines how institutional motivations, regulatory compliance, and ethical and cultural acceptance drive organisations to develop and adopt AI innovations, enhancing their market acceptance and transnational accountability. We extend the TAM framework by incorporating regulatory, ethical, and socio-technical considerations as key social pressures shaping AI adoption. Recognizing that AI is embedded within complex actor-networks, we argue that accountability is co-constructed among organisations, regulators, and societal actors rather than being confined to individual developers or adopters. To address these challenges, we propose two key solutions: (1) internal resource reconfiguration, where organisations restructure their governance and compliance mechanisms to align with global standards; and (2) reshaping organisational boundaries through actor-network management, fostering engagement with external stakeholders, regulatory bodies, and transnational governance institutions. These approaches allow organisations to enhance AI accountability, foster ethical and regulatory alignment, and improve market acceptance on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Where do Germany's electricity imports come from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, Germany's electricity trade balance shifted from net exports to net imports for the first time since 2002, resulting in an increasing discussion of these imports in the public debate. This study discusses different data driven approaches for the analysis of Germany's cross-border trade, with a focus on the methodological challenges to determine the origin of imported electricity within the framework of European electricity market coupling. While scheduled commercial flows from ENTSO-E are often used as indicators, generally these do not correspond to bilateral exchanges between different market actors. In particular, for day-ahead market coupling only net positions have an economically reasonable interpretation, and scheduled commercial exchanges are defined through ex-post algorithmic calculations. Any measure of the origin of electricity imports thus depends on some underlying interpretation and corresponding method, ranging from local flow patterns to correlations in net positions. To illustrate this dependence on methodological choices, we compare different approaches to determine the origin of electricity imports for hourly European power system data for 2024.</description>

      <title>Price Regulation, Technology and Provider Redistribution: Insights from Parity Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do price regulations lead to inefficiencies and trade loss? The answer depends on the type of regulation, monetary and non-monetary factors influencing demand, technological factors affecting supply elasticities, difference between pre-regulation and expected post-regulation prices, and geographical area. State-level variations in telehealth parity laws provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of Price Controls and Cost Controls on healthcare service quantity, proxied by physician count, across metro and non-metro areas, with broadband as a technological mediator. At the micro level, Price Controls distort the input mix, causing production inefficiency and rotating the supply curve. Cost Controls change the consumption mix, causing consumption inefficiency and rotating the demand curve. This results in equilibrium quantity shifts causing allocative inefficiency in healthcare provision, signified by physician redistribution at the macro level. The micro-founded non-price competition models predicts shifts from unregulated to regulated equilibrium quantities under various combinations of Price Control and Cost Control types. Empirical analysis supports these predictions, showing that a Price Ceiling or Price Floor positively affects physician count in metro areas but negatively in non-metro areas. Conversely, Cost Parity has a negative effect in metro areas, while a Cost Ceiling positively impacts physician count in both regions. When examining combinations of different types of Price and Cost Controls, Cost Parity tends to dominate with a net negative effect, whereas a Cost Ceiling amplifies the positive effect of a Price Ceiling. The findings challenge the conventional narratives and underscore the role of regional disparities and technology in shaping policy outcomes.</description>
