      <title>Youden's Demon is Sylvester's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If four people with Gaussian-distributed heights stand at Gaussian positions on the plane, the probability that there are exactly two people whose height is above the average of the four is exactly the same as the probability that they stand in convex position; both probabilities are $\frac 6 \pi \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\approx .649$. We show that this is a special case of a more general phenomenon: The problem of determining the position of the mean among the order statistics of Gaussian random points on the real line ("Youden's demon problem") is the same as a natural generalization of Sylvester's Four Point problem to Gaussian points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main tool is the observation that the Gale dual of independent samples in $\mathbb{R}^d$ itself can be taken to be a set of independent points (conditioned on barycenter at the origin) when the distribution of the points is Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Approach to Hyperuniformity in the One-Dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorem for the principal eigenvalue of dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic version of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph, in which edges independently appear and disappear in time, with the on- and off times being exponentially distributed. The focus lies on the evolution of the principle eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix in the regime that the number of vertices grows large. The main result is a functional central limit theorem, which displays that the principal eigenvalue essentially inherits the characteristics of the dynamics of the individual edges.</description>

      <title>Utility maximisation and change of variable formulas for time-changed dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive novel change of variable formulas for stochastic integrals w.r.t. a time-changed Brownian motion where we assume that the time-change is a general increasing stochastic process with finitely many jumps in a bounded set of the positive half-line and is independent of the Brownian motion. As an application we consider the problem of maximising the expected utility of the terminal wealth in a semimartingale setting, where the semimartingale is written in terms of a time-changed Brownian motion and a finite variation process. To solve this problem, we use an initial enlargement of filtration and our change of variable formulas to shift the problem to a maximisation problem under the enlarged filtration for models driven by a Brownian motion and a finite variation process. The latter problem can be solved by using martingale properties. Then applying again a change of variable formula, we derive the optimal strategy for the original problem for a power utility and for a logarithmic utility.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion of the weighted power variation with second order differences of a stochastic differential equation driven by fBm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a process satisfying a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&gt;1/2$, and consider the weighted power variation based on the second order differences of the process. We derive the asymptotic expansion formula of its distribution based on the theory of expansion of Skorohod integrals by Nualart and Yoshida. The formula includes the rate of convergence as a corollary. To facilitate the application of the general expansion theory, we employ the theory of exponents from arXiv:2407.02254 to obtain estimates of functionals.</description>

      <title>Optimal Unimodular Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sequences of finite weighted random graphs that converge locally to unimodular i.i.d. weighted random trees. When the weights are atomless, we prove that the matchings of maximal weight converge locally to a matching on the limiting tree. For this purpose, we introduce and study unimodular matchings on weighted unimodular random trees as well as a notion of optimality for these objects. In this context, we prove that, in law, there is a unique optimal unimodular matching for a given unimodular tree. We then prove that this law is the local limit of the sequence of matchings of maximal weight. Along the way, we also show that this law is characterised by an equation derived from a message passing algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Max-Flow approach to Random Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a random tensor network (RTN) using tools from free probability theory. Random tensor networks are simple toy models that help the understanding of the entanglement behavior of a boundary region in the ADS/CFT context. One can think of random tensor networks are specific probabilistic models for tensors having some particular geometry dictated by a graph (or network) structure. We first introduce our model of RTN, obtained by contracting maximally entangled states (corresponding to the edges of the graph) on the tensor product of Gaussian tensors (corresponding to the vertices of the graph). We study the entanglement spectrum of the resulting random spectrum along a given bipartition of the local Hilbert spaces. We provide the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density operator of the RTN state, in the limit of large local dimension. The limit value is described via a maximum flow optimization problem in a new graph corresponding to the geometry of the RTN and the given bipartition. In the case of series-parallel graphs, we provide an explicit formula for the limiting eigenvalue distribution using classical and free multiplicative convolutions. We discuss the physical implications of our results, allowing us to go beyond the semiclassical regime without any cut assumption, specifically in terms of finite corrections to the average entanglement entropy of the RTN.</description>

      <title>Output Range Analysis for Deep Neural Networks based on Simulated Annealing Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of output range estimation for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), introducing a novel algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA). Our approach addresses the lack of local geometric information and high non-linearity in DNNs, making it versatile across various architectures, especially Residual Neural Networks (ResNets). We present a straightforward, implementation-friendly algorithm that avoids restrictive assumptions about network architecture. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations, including tests on the Ackley function, we demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in navigating complex, non-convex surfaces and accurately estimating DNN output ranges. Futhermore, the Python codes of this experimental evaluation that support our results are available in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/Nicerova7/output-range-analysis-for-deep-neural-networks-with-simulated-annealing).</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part II: Dynamics of Distributed Stochastic Continuum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviors of subcritical branching killed Brownian motion with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviors of a subcritical branching killed Brownian motion with drift $-\rho$ and offspring distribution $\{p_k:k\ge 0\}$. Let $\widetilde{\zeta}^{-\rho}$ be the extinction time of this subcritical branching killed Brownian motion, $\widetilde{M}_t^{-\rho}$ the maximal position of all the particles alive at time $t$ and $\widetilde{M}^{-\rho}:=\max_{t\ge 0}\widetilde{M}_t^{-\rho}$ the all time maximal position. Let $\mathbb{P}_x$ be the law of this subcritical branching killed Brownian motion when the initial particle is located at $x\in (0,\infty)$. Under the assumption $\sum_{k=1}^\infty k (\log k) p_k &lt;\infty$, we establish the decay rates of $\mathbb{P}_x(\widetilde{\zeta}^{-\rho}&gt;t)$ and $\mathbb{P}_x(\widetilde{M}^{-\rho}&gt;y)$ as $t$ and $y$ tend to $\infty$ respectively. We also establish the decay rate of $\mathbb{P}_x(\widetilde{M}_t^{-\rho}&gt;z(t,\rho))$ as $t\to\infty$, where $z(t,\rho)=\sqrt{t}z-\rho t$ for $\rho\leq 0$ and $z(t,\rho)=z$ for $\rho&gt;0$. As a consequence, we obtain a Yaglom-type limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of designs, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant models. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Primitive Lattice Points in Large Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the distribution of primitive lattice points in a symmetric Borel set $S_d\subset\mathbb R^d$ as $d$ goes to infinity, under certain volume conditions on $S_d$. Our main technique involves exploring higher moment formulas for the primitive Siegel transform. We first demonstrate that if the volume of $S_d$ remains fixed for all $d\in \mathbb N$, then the distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Poisson distribution of mean $\frac 1 2$. Furthermore, if the volume of $S_d$ goes to infinity subexponentially as $d$ approaches infinity, the normalized distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the normal distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. We also extend these results to the setting of stochastic processes. This work is motivated by the contributions of Rogers (1955), S\"odergren (2011) and Str\"ombergsson and S\"odergren (2019).</description>

Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields b in L^1_{loc}((0,1];BV(\T^d;\R^d)), there exists a unique incompressible measure on integral curves of b. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in [Depauw, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci.
