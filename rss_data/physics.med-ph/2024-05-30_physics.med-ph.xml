      <title>Exploring Automated Contouring Across Institutional Boundaries: A Deep Learning Approach with Mouse Micro-CT Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-guided mouse irradiation is essential to understand interventions involving radiation prior to human studies. Our objective is to employ Swin UNEt Transformers (Swin UNETR) to segment native micro-CT and contrast-enhanced micro-CT scans and benchmark the results against 3D no-new-Net (nnU-Net). Swin UNETR reformulates mouse organ segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task, using a hierarchical Swin Transformer encoder to extract features at 5 resolution levels, and connects to a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)-based decoder via skip connections. The models were trained and evaluated on open datasets, with data separation based on individual mice. Further evaluation on an external mouse dataset acquired on a different micro-CT with lower kVp and higher imaging noise was also employed to assess model robustness and generalizability. Results indicate that Swin UNETR consistently outperforms nnU-Net and AIMOS in terms of average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD95p), except in two mice of intestine contouring. This superior performance is especially evident in the external dataset, confirming the model's robustness to variations in imaging conditions, including noise and quality, thereby positioning Swin UNETR as a highly generalizable and efficient tool for automated contouring in pre-clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Zero-echo-time sequences in highly inhomogeneous fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero echo time (ZTE) sequences have proven a powerful tool for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of ultrashort T2 tissues, but they fail to produce useful images in the presence of strong field inhomogeneities. Here we present a method to correct artifacts induced by strong B0 inhomogeneities in non-Cartesian sequences, based on magnetic field maps obtained from the phase difference between two fast pointwise acquisitions. These are free of geometric distortions and can be used for model based image reconstruction with iterative algebraic techniques. In this paper, we show that distortions and artifacts coming from inhomogeneites in B0 are largely reverted by our method, as opposed to standard Conjugate Phase reconstructions. We base this technique on a Single-Point Double-Shot (SPDS) approach, and we have shown it to work even for intra-voxel bandwidths (determined by B0 inhomogeneities) comparable to the encoding bandwidth (determined by the gradient fields). We benchmark the performance of SPDS for ZTE acquisitions, which can be exploited for e.g. dental imaging in affordable low-field MRI systems. Furthermore, SPDS can be used for arbitrary pulse sequences and it may prove useful for extreme magnet geometries, as in e.g. single-sided MRI.</description>

      <title>Exploring the redundancy of Radon transform using a set of partial derivative equations: Could we precisely reconstruct the image from a sparse-view projection without any image prior?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we proposed a universal n-th order partial differential equation (PDE) of 2-D Radon transform to disclose the relationship of Radon transform over a neighborhood of the integral line, named as local correlation equation (LCE). It is independent to the imaging object while in present CT theory, the relationship of Radon transform over neighboring integral line had been described depended on the imaging objection. Hence, the LCE is the first PDE to reveal the universal correlation property of Radon transform. The LCE can be applied to either of 2D CT projections or any 2-D profile of 3-D CT projections. The correlation also provides the redundancy property of Radon transform. In this regard, we carried out a preliminary study on sparse-view CT reconstruction by using a discrete first order LCE to interpolate missing projections in sparse-view sampling without knowing image prior. Meanwhile, we also proposed a unified reconstruction framework that combines a regularized iterative reconstruction with the LCE based interpolation method to handle the sparse-view CT problem with higher sparsity level. The conducted experiments have credibly validated the proposed LCE, projection interpolation method, and the unified reconstruction scheme. The result of this study suggests an attractive possibility that a sparse-view projection may contain enough information of the complete projection, by which projection completeness in CT scanning may not be necessity. This possibility would bring profound changes in CT geometry designs and reconstruction algorithms. Moreover, this study initiates an appealing research topic of exploring the redundancy property of Radon transform and investigating new CT theories based on the redundancy property, which will boost the further development of CT reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Rational Approximation of Golden Angles: Accelerated Reconstructions with Simple and Numerically Reproducible Radial Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a generic radial sampling scheme that combines the advantages of golden ratio sampling with simplicity of equidistant angular patterns. The irrational angle between consecutive spokes in golden ratio based sampling schemes enables a flexible retrospective choice of temporal resolution, while preserving good coverage of k-space for each individual bin. Nevertheless, irrational increments prohibit precomputation of the point-spread function (PSF), can lead to numerical problems, and require more complex processing steps. To avoid these problems, a new sampling scheme based on a rational approximation of golden angles (RAGA) is developed.
  Methods: The theoretical properties of RAGA sampling are mathematically derived. Sidelobe-to-peak ratios (SPR) are numerically computed and compared to the corresponding golden ratio sampling schemes. The sampling scheme is implemented in the BART toolbox and in a radial gradient-echo sequence. Feasibility is shown for quantitative imaging in a phantom and a cardiac scan of a healthy volunteer.
  Results: RAGA sampling can accurately approximate golden ratio sampling and has almost identical PSF and SPR. In contrast to golden ratio sampling, each frame can be reconstructed with the same equidistant trajectory using different sampling masks, and the angle of each acquired spoke can be encoded as a small index, which simplifies processing of the acquired data.
  Conclusion: RAGA sampling provides the advantages of golden ratio sampling while simplifying data processing, rendering it a valuable tool for dynamic and quantitative MRI.</description>

      <title>ResNCT: A Deep Learning Model for the Synthesis of Nephrographic Phase Images in CT Urography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a transformer-based deep learning model for the synthesis of nephrographic phase images in CT urography (CTU) examinations from the unenhanced and urographic phases.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. A dataset of 119 patients (mean $\pm$ SD age, 65 $\pm$ 12 years; 75/44 males/females) with three-phase CT urography studies was curated for deep learning model development. The three phases for each patient were aligned with an affine registration algorithm. A custom model, coined Residual transformer model for Nephrographic phase CT image synthesis (ResNCT), was developed and implemented with paired inputs of non-contrast and urographic sets of images trained to produce the nephrographic phase images, that were compared with the corresponding ground truth nephrographic phase images. The synthesized images were evaluated with multiple performance metrics, including peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized cross correlation coefficient (NCC), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
  Results: The ResNCT model successfully generated synthetic nephrographic images from non-contrast and urographic image inputs. With respect to ground truth nephrographic phase images, the images synthesized by the model achieved high PSNR (27.8 $\pm$ 2.7 dB), SSIM (0.88 $\pm$ 0.05), and NCC (0.98 $\pm$ 0.02), and low MAE (0.02 $\pm$ 0.005) and RMSE (0.042 $\pm$ 0.016).
  Conclusion: The ResNCT model synthesized nephrographic phase CT images with high similarity to ground truth images. The ResNCT model provides a means of eliminating the acquisition of the nephrographic phase with a resultant 33% reduction in radiation dose for CTU examinations.</description>
