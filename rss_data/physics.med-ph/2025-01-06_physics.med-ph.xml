      <title>Review Article: Integral Role of Physics in Advancing Pharmacy Education and Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics plays a fundamental role in advancing pharmacy education and research, providing theoretical underpinnings and practical tools necessary to address complex challenges in drug development, delivery, and diagnostics. This review explores the integration of physics into the pharmacy curriculum, highlighting how principles such as fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and spectroscopy (Tokgoz and Sakalli, 2018) enhance students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it examines the pivotal contributions of physics to pharmaceutical research, including molecular modeling, imaging technologies like MRI and PET, and nanotechnology-driven drug delivery systems. Despite challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration and resource allocation, innovative teaching strategies and laboratory based learning are shown significant promise. Looking forward, the convergence of artificial intelligence and physics, as highlighted by recent Nobel Prize achievements in attosecond physics and bioorthogonal chemistry, is set to revolutionize pharmaceutical sciences, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in drug discovery and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Estimation of 3T MR images from 1.5T images regularized with Physics based Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited accessibility to high field MRI scanners (such as 7T, 11T) has motivated the development of post-processing methods to improve low field images. Several existing post-processing methods have shown the feasibility to improve 3T images to produce 7T-like images [3,18]. It has been observed that improving lower field (LF, &lt;=1.5T) images comes with additional challenges due to poor image quality such as the function mapping 1.5T and higher field (HF, 3T) images is more complex than the function relating 3T and 7T images [10]. Except for [10], no method has been addressed to improve &lt;=1.5T MRI images. Further, most of the existing methods [3,18] including [10] require example images, and also often rely on pixel to pixel correspondences between LF and HF images which are usually inaccurate for &lt;=1.5T images. The focus of this paper is to address the unsupervised framework for quality improvement of 1.5T images and avoid the expensive requirements of example images and associated image registration. The LF and HF images are assumed to be related by a linear transformation (LT). The unknown HF image and unknown LT are estimated in alternate minimization framework. Further, a physics based constraint is proposed that provides an additional non-linear function relating LF and HF images in order to achieve the desired high contrast in estimated HF image. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides processed 1.5T images, i.e., estimated 3T-like images with improved image quality, and is comparably better than the existing methods addressing similar problems. The improvement in image quality is also shown to provide better tissue segmentation and volume quantification as compared to scanner acquired 1.5T images.</description>

      <title>Laparoscopic Scene Analysis for Intraoperative Visualisation of Gamma Probe Signals in Minimally Invasive Cancer Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer remains a significant health challenge worldwide, with a new diagnosis occurring every two minutes in the UK. Surgery is one of the main treatment options for cancer. However, surgeons rely on the sense of touch and naked eye with limited use of pre-operative image data to directly guide the excision of cancerous tissues and metastases due to the lack of reliable intraoperative visualisation tools. This leads to increased costs and harm to the patient where the cancer is removed with positive margins, or where other critical structures are unintentionally impacted. There is therefore a pressing need for more reliable and accurate intraoperative visualisation tools for minimally invasive surgery to improve surgical outcomes and enhance patient care.
  A recent miniaturised cancer detection probe (i.e., SENSEI developed by Lightpoint Medical Ltd.) leverages the cancer-targeting ability of nuclear agents to more accurately identify cancer intra-operatively using the emitted gamma signal. However, the use of this probe presents a visualisation challenge as the probe is non-imaging and is air-gapped from the tissue, making it challenging for the surgeon to locate the probe-sensing area on the tissue surface. Geometrically, the sensing area is defined as the intersection point between the gamma probe axis and the tissue surface in 3D space but projected onto the 2D laparoscopic image. Hence, in this thesis, tool tracking, pose estimation, and segmentation tools were developed first, followed by laparoscope image depth estimation algorithms and 3D reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>De-aberration for transcranial photoacoustic computed tomography through an adult human skull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noninvasive transcranial photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) of the human brain, despite its clinical potential as a complementary technology to functional MRI, remains impeded by the acoustic distortion induced by the human skull. The distortion, which is attributed to the markedly different material properties of the skull relative to soft tissue, results in heavily aberrated PACT images -- a problem that has remained unsolved for the past two decades. Herein, we report the first successful experimental demonstration of the de-aberration of PACT images through an ex-vivo adult human skull using a homogeneous elastic model for the skull. Using only the geometry, position, and orientation of the skull, we faithfully de-aberrate the PACT images of light-absorbing phantoms acquired through an ex-vivo human skull for different levels of phantom complexity and positions. We also demonstrate the generality of our results by attaining a similar extent of de-aberration through a second ex-vivo human skull. Our work addresses the longstanding challenge of skull-induced aberrations in transcranial PACT and advances the field towards unlocking the full potential of transcranial human brain PACT.</description>

      <title>A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs (OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning capabilities, the correct answers in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explaining-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning capabilities. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answers with "None of the above," all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explaining-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning capabilities of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics training and education.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Learning for Microbubble Localization in Super-Resolution Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) is a powerful imaging technique for capturing microvasculature and blood flow at high spatial resolution. However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.</description>
