      <title>Lower bounds for the universal TSP on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a lower bound for the universal traveling salesman heuristic on the plane: for any linear order on the unit square $[0,1]^2$, there are finite subsets $S \subset [0,1]^2$ of arbitrarily large size such that the path visiting each element of $S$ according to the linear order has length $\geq C \sqrt{\log |S| / \log \log |S|}$ times the length of the shortest path visiting each element in $S$. ($C&gt;0$ is a constant that depends only on the linear order.) This improves the previous lower bound $\geq C \sqrt[6]{\log |S| / \log \log |S|}$ of [HKL06]. The proof establishes a dichotomy about any long walk on a cycle: the walk either zig-zags between two far away points, or else for a large amount of time it stays inside a set of small diameter.</description>

      <title>The farthest point map on the 4-cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the farthest point mapping on (the boundary of) the 4-cube with respect to the intrinsic metric, and its dynamics as a multivalued mapping. It is a piecewise rational map. It is more complicated than the one on the 3-cube, but it is shown that the limit set of the farthest point map on the 4-cube is the union of the diagonals of eight (3-cube) facets, like the farthest point map on the 3-cube whose limit set is the union of the six (square) facets. This is in contrast to the doubly covered simplices and (the boundary of) the regular 4-simplex, where the limit set is a finite set. If the source point is in the interior of a facet, its limit set is also in the facet.
  The farthest point mapping is closely related to the star unfolding and source unfolding. We give a loose definition of star unfolding of the surface of a 4-dimensional polytope.
  We also study the intrinsic radius and diameter of the 4-cube. It is expected that the intrinsic radius/diameter ratio of an n-cube is monotonically decreasing in dimension.</description>

      <title>Gradient flows on metric graphs with reservoirs: Microscopic derivation and multiscale limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study evolution equations on metric graphs with reservoirs, that is graphs where a one-dimensional interval is associated to each edge and, in addition, the vertices are able to store and exchange mass with these intervals. Focusing on the case where the dynamics are driven by an entropy functional defined both on the metric edges and vertices, we provide a rigorous understanding of such systems of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations as (generalized) gradient flows in continuity equation format. Approximating the edges by a sequence of vertices, which yields a fully discrete system, we are able to establish existence of solutions in this formalism. Furthermore, we study several scaling limits using the recently developed framework of EDP convergence with embeddings to rigorously show convergence to gradient flows on reduced metric and combinatorial graphs. Finally, numerical studies confirm our theoretical findings and provide additional insights into the dynamics under rescaling.</description>

      <title>On The Heine-Borel Property and Minimum Enclosing Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute a proof that minimum radius balls over metric spaces with the Heine-Borel property are always LP type. Additionally, we prove that weak metric spaces, those without symmetry, also have this property if we fix the direction in which we take their distances from the centers of the balls. We use this to prove that the minimum radius ball problem is LP type in the Hilbert and Thompson metrics and Funk weak metric. In doing so, we contribute a proof that the topology induced by the Thompson metric coincides with the Hilbert. We provide explicit primitives for computing the minimum radius ball in the Hilbert metric.</description>

      <title>Translational Aperiodic Sets of 7 Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, two extraordinary results on aperiodic monotiles have been obtained in two different settings. One is a family of aperiodic monotiles in the plane discovered by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss in 2023, where rotation is allowed, breaking the 50-year-old record (aperiodic sets of two tiles found by Roger Penrose in the 1970s) on the minimum size of aperiodic sets in the plane. The other is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in the translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for some huge dimension $n$ proved by Greenfeld and Tao. This disproves the long-standing periodic tiling conjecture. However, it is known that there is no aperiodic monotile for translational tiling of the plane. The smallest size of known aperiodic sets for translational tilings of the plane is $8$, which was discovered more than $30$ years ago by Ammann. In this paper, we prove that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $7$ polyominoes is undecidable. As a consequence of the undecidability, we have constructed a family of aperiodic sets of size $7$ for the translational tiling of the plane. This breaks the 30-year-old record of Ammann.</description>

      <title>Critical level set percolation for the GFF in $d&gt;6$: comparison principles and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the intrinsic geometry of the critical percolation cluster induced by the level set of the metric Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ above the critical dimension of six. (Lupu, 2016) established that the critical percolation cluster has the same law as that in a Poisson loop soup where the intensity is dictated by the Green's function of the usual random walk. A sharp Euclidean one arm exponent was proven recently in (Cai and Ding, 2023), and subsequently in (Ganguly and Nam, 2024) other results about the chemical one arm exponent, volume growth and the Alexander-Orbach conjecture were established for all $d&gt;20.$
  In this paper, we introduce new methods to obtain several sharp estimates about the intrinsic geometry which hold for all $d&gt;6$. We develop two primary comparison methods. The first involves a comparison of the extrinsic (Euclidean) and intrinsic metrics allowing estimates about the former to be transferrable to the latter. The second compares intrinsic geodesics to a class of modified paths which are non-backtracking in a certain loop sense. The latter is amenable to analysis using methods of bond percolation. We finally prove that such non-backtracking paths are not much longer than geodesics allowing us to establish comparable estimates for the geodesic. As applications of such methods, we establish, for all $d&gt;6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as well as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts that deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the connection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$ An important ingredient of independent interest is a local connectivity estimate which asserts that the connection probability between two points at distance $r$ remains, up to constants, unchanged even if the connecting path is confined to a ball of diameter comparable to $r.$</description>

      <title>Finite-State Machines for Horospheres in Hyperbolic Right-Angled Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relatively little is known about the discrete horospheres in hyperbolic groups, even in simple settings. In this paper we work with hyperbolic one-ended right-angled Coxeter groups and describe two graph structures that mimic the intrinsic metric on a classical horosphere: the Rips graph and the divergence graph (the latter due to Cohen, Goodman-Strauss, and Rieck). We develop, analyze, and implement algorithms based on finite-state machines that draw large finite portions of these graphs, and deduce various geometric corollaries about the path metrics induced by these graph structures.</description>

      <title>First Passage Percolation on Hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study first passage percolation (FPP) on a Gromov-hyperbolic group $G$ with boundary $\partial G$ equipped with the Patterson-Sullivan measure $\nu$. We associate an i.i.d.\ collection of random passage times to each edge of a Cayley graph of $G$, and investigate classical questions about the asymptotics of first passage time as well as the geometry of geodesics in the FPP metric. Under suitable conditions on the passage time distribution, we show that the `velocity' exists in $\nu$-almost every direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and is almost surely constant by ergodicity of the $G-$action on $\partial G$. For every $\xi\in \partial G$, we also show almost sure coalescence of any two geodesic rays directed towards $\xi$. Finally, we show that the variance of the first passage time grows linearly with word distance along word geodesic rays in every fixed boundary direction. This provides an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Benjamini, Tessera, and Zeitouni.</description>

      <title>On elliptic and quasiregularly elliptic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his book "Metric structures for Riemannian and non-Riemannian spaces", Gromov defined two properties of Riemannian manifolds, ellipticity and quasiregular ellipticity, and suggested that there may be a connection between the two. Since then, groups of researchers working independently have proved strikingly similar results about these two concepts. We obtain new topological obstructions to the two properties: most notably, we show that closed manifolds of both types must have virtually abelian fundamental group. We also give the first examples of open manifolds which are elliptic but not quasireguarly elliptic and vice versa. Whether there is a direct connection between these properties -- and, in particular, whether they are equivalent for closed manifolds -- remains elusive.</description>
