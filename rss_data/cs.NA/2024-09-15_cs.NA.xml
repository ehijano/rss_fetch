      <title>Mixed precision iterative refinement for linear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the iterative refinement method applied to the solution of linear discrete inverse problems by considering its application to the Tikhonov problem in mixed precision. Previous works on mixed precision iterative refinement methods for the solution of symmetric positive definite linear systems and least-squares problems have shown regularization to be a key requirement when computing low precision factorizations. For problems that are naturally severely ill-posed, we formulate the iterates of iterative refinement in mixed precision as a filtered solution using the preconditioned Landweber method with a Tikhonov-type preconditioner. Through numerical examples simulating various mixed precision choices, we showcase the filtering properties of the method and the achievement of comparable or superior accuracy compared to results computed in double precision as well as another approximate method.</description>

      <title>Deep Ritz -- Finite Element methods: Neural Network Methods trained with Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Local surrogate models with reduced dimensionality via overlapping domain decomposition and proper generalized decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient algorithm that combines overlapping domain decomposition and proper generalized decomposition (PGD) to construct surrogate models of linear elliptic parametric problems. The technique is composed of an offline and an online phase that can be implemented in a fully non-intrusive way. The online phase relies on a substructured algebraic formulation of the alternating Schwarz method, while the offline phase exploits the linearity of the boundary value problem to characterize a PGD basis and generate local surrogate models, with minimal parametric dimensionality, in each subdomain. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>The Immersed Weak Galerkin and Continuous Galerkin Finite Element Method for Elliptic Interface Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the weak Galerkin finite element method to solve the elliptic interface problem on interface-independent meshes. In the interface element, we use the immersed finite element (IFE) functions satisfying the interface conditions precisely and they have optimal approximation capabilities. In the non-interface element, the continuous element is employed to approximate the exact solution. The optimal convergence orders of error are obtained in the $H^1$ norm and $L^2$ norm. A series of numerical experiments are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The area of inverse problems in mathematics is highly interdisciplinary. In various fields of science, engineering, medicine, and industry, there arises a need to reconstruct information about unknown entities that cannot be directly observed. Examples include medical imaging techniques such as X-ray CT and optical tomography. Indeed, the mathematics of inverse problems has often originated from challenges posed by other fields. Inverse problems are often ill-posed and solutions are unstable. In this lecture, we will explore methods to solve such inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Deep Picard Iteration for High-Dimensional Nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Deep Picard Iteration (DPI) method, a new deep learning approach for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). The core innovation of DPI lies in its use of Picard iteration to reformulate the typically complex training objectives of neural network-based PDE solutions into much simpler, standard regression tasks based on function values and gradients. This design not only greatly simplifies the optimization process but also offers the potential for further scalability through parallel data generation. Crucially, to fully realize the benefits of regressing on both function values and gradients in the DPI method, we address the issue of infinite variance in the estimators of gradients by incorporating a control variate, supported by our theoretical analysis. Our experiments on problems up to 100 dimensions demonstrate that DPI consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with greater robustness to hyperparameters, particularly in challenging scenarios with long time horizons and strong nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Fractional-step High-order and Bound-preserving Method for Convection Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive two bound-preserving and mass-conserving schemes based on the fractional-step method and high-order compact (HOC) finite difference method for nonlinear convection-dominated diffusion equations. We split the one-dimensional equation into three stages, and employ appropriate temporal and spatial discrete schemes respectively. We show that our scheme is weakly monotonic and that the bound-preserving property can be achieved using the bound-preserving limiter under some mild step constraints. By employing the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method, we extend the scheme to two-dimensional problems, further reducing computational cost. We also provide various numerical experiments to verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the B-series composition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The B-series composition theorem has been an important topic in numerical analysis of ordinary differential equations for the past-half century. Traditional proofs of this theorem rely on labelled trees, whereas recent developments in B-series analysis favour the use of unlabelled trees. In this paper, we present a new proof of the B-series composition theorem that does not depend on labelled trees. A key challenge in this approach is accurately counting combinations related to ``pruning.'' This challenge is overcome by introducing the concept of ``assignment.''</description>

      <title>Applications of multiscale hierarchical decomposition to blind deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blind image deconvolution is a challenging, highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We introduce a Multiscale Hierarchical Decomposition Method (MHDM) that is iteratively solving variational problems with adaptive data and regularization parameters, towards obtaining finer and finer details of the unknown kernel and image. We establish convergence of the residual in the noise-free data case, and then in the noisy data case when the algorithm is stopped early by means of a discrepancy principle. Fractional Sobolev norms are employed as regularizers for both kernel and image, with the advantage of computing the minimizers explicitly in a pointwise manner. In order to break the notorious symmetry occurring during each minimization step, we enforce a positivity constraint on the Fourier transform of the kernels. Numerical comparisons with a single-step variational method and a non-blind MHDM show that our approach produces comparable results, while less laborious parameter tuning is necessary at the price of more computations. Additionally, the scale decomposition of both reconstructed kernel and image provides a meaningful interpretation of the involved iteration steps.</description>

      <title>Computation of $M$-QDR decomposition of tensors and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory and computation of tensors with different tensor products play increasingly important roles in scientific computing and machine learning. Different products aim to preserve different algebraic properties from the matrix algebra, and the choice of tensor product determines the algorithms that can be directly applied. This study introduced a novel full-rank decomposition and $M$-$\mc{QDR}$ decomposition for third-order tensors based on $M$-product. Then, we designed algorithms for computing these two decompositions along with the Moore-Penrose inverse, and outer inverse of the tensors. In support of these theoretical results, a few numerical examples were discussed. In addition, we derive exact expressions for the outer inverses of tensors using symbolic tensor (tensors with polynomial entries) computation. We designed efficient algorithms to compute the Moore-Penrose inverse of symbolic tensors. The prowess of the proposed $M$-$\mc{QDR}$ decomposition for third-order tensors is applied to compress lossy color images.</description>

      <title>Conforming finite element approximation for the fully-coupled non-linear thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nernst-Planck model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the behavior of electrolyte systems. However, inherent deficiencies in this model have spurred the exploration of alternative approaches. In this context, this study presents simulation in multidimensional contexts for a new, fully-coupled, non-linear, thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model introduced by Dreyer et al. We present a robust mathematical formulation and employ a conforming finite element approximation to comprehensively explore both compressible and incompressible variants of the electrolyte mixture. Our investigation extends across diverse spatial dimensions, facilitating an in-depth analysis of parametric dependencies governing space-charge layer formation at boundaries under external voltage influence. Furthermore, meticulous consideration is given to finite ion size effects, which play a critical role in electrolyte flow dynamics. Insights from annular battery designs are also incorporated, which introduce unique dynamics to ion transport phenomena. Through rigorous simulations, we validate the accuracy and reliability of our numerical scheme, thereby laying the groundwork for an enhanced understanding and optimization of electrolyte system behaviors across various applications, notably in semiconductor devices and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow decay of singular values. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying a space-local POD within each subdomain, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method. Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D advection equation discretized using a central difference scheme. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps.</description>

      <title>Graph grammars and Physics Informed Neural Networks for simulating of pollution propagation on Spitzbergen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two computational methods for performing simulations of pollution propagation described by advection-diffusion equations. The first method employs graph grammars to describe the generation process of the computational mesh used in simulations with the meshless solver of the three-dimensional finite element method. The graph transformation rules express the three-dimensional Rivara longest-edge refinement algorithm. This solver is used for an exemplary application: performing three-dimensional simulations of pollution generation by the coal-burning power plant and its propagation in the city of Longyearbyen, the capital of Spitsbergen. The second computational code is based on the Physics Informed Neural Networks method. It is used to calculate the dissipation of the pollution along the valley in which the city of Longyearbyen is located. We discuss the instantiation and execution of the PINN method using Google Colab implementation. We discuss the benefits and limitations of the PINN implementation.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Subspaces of Ensemble Kalman Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) methods are a family of iterative methods for solving weighted least-squares problems, especially those arising in scientific and engineering inverse problems in which unknown parameters or states are estimated from observed data by minimizing the weighted square norm of the data misfit. Implementation of EKI requires only evaluation of the forward model mapping the unknown to the data, and does not require derivatives or adjoints of the forward model. The methods therefore offer an attractive alternative to gradient-based optimization approaches in large-scale inverse problems where evaluating derivatives or adjoints of the forward model is computationally intractable. This work presents a new analysis of the behavior of both deterministic and stochastic versions of basic EKI for linear observation operators, resulting in a natural interpretation of EKI's convergence properties in terms of ``fundamental subspaces'' analogous to Strang's fundamental subspaces of linear algebra. Our analysis directly examines the discrete EKI iterations instead of their continuous-time limits considered in previous analyses, and provides spectral decompositions that define six fundamental subspaces of EKI spanning both observation and state spaces. This approach verifies convergence rates previously derived for continuous-time limits, and yields new results describing both deterministic and stochastic EKI convergence behavior with respect to the standard minimum-norm weighted least squares solution in terms of the fundamental subspaces. Numerical experiments illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Estimatable variation neural networks and their application to ODEs and scalar hyperbolic conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce estimatable variation neural networks (EVNNs), a class of neural networks that allow a computationally cheap estimate on the $BV$ norm motivated by the space $BMV$ of functions with bounded M-variation. We prove a universal approximation theorem for EVNNs and discuss possible implementations. We construct sequences of loss functionals for ODEs and scalar hyperbolic conservation laws for which a vanishing loss leads to convergence. Moreover, we show the existence of sequences of loss minimizing neural networks if the solution is an element of $BMV$. Several numerical test cases illustrate that it is possible to use standard techniques to minimize these loss functionals for EVNNs.</description>

Due to the peculiar characteristics of such equations, analytic solutions are usually not available and numerical methods are the main tools for approximating the solutions. In the last decade, artificial neural networks have become an active area of development for solving partial differential equations. However, several challenges remain unresolved with these methods when applied to reaction-diffusion equations. In this work, we focus on two main problems. The implementation of homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and long-time integrations. For the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, we explore four different neural network methods based on the PINN approach. For the long time integration in Reaction-Diffusion systems, we propose a domain splitting method in time and provide detailed comparisons between different implementations of no-flux boundary conditions. We show that the domain splitting method is crucial in the neural network approach, for long time integration in Reaction-Diffusion systems. We demonstrate numerically that domain splitting is essential for avoiding local minima, and the use of different boundary conditions further enhances the splitting technique by improving numerical approximations. To validate the proposed methods, we provide numerical examples for the Diffusion, the Bistable and the Barkley equations and provide a detailed discussion and comparisons of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Cubature-based uncertainty estimation for nonlinear regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibrating model parameters to measured data by minimizing loss functions is an important step in obtaining realistic predictions from model-based approaches, e.g., for process optimization. This is applicable to both knowledge-driven and data-driven model setups. Due to measurement errors, the calibrated model parameters also carry uncertainty. In this contribution, we use cubature formulas based on sparse grids to calculate the variance of the regression results. The number of cubature points is close to the theoretical minimum required for a given level of exactness. We present exact benchmark results, which we also compare to other cubatures. This scheme is then applied to estimate the prediction uncertainty of the NRTL model, calibrated to observations from different experimental designs.</description>

      <title>The Better Solution Probability Metric: Optimizing QAOA to Outperform its Warm-Start Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical simulation investigation of the Warm-Start Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as proposed by Tate et al. [1], focusing on its application to 3-regular Max-Cut problems. Our study demonstrates that Warm-Start QAOA consistently outperforms theoretical lower bounds on approximation ratios across various tilt angles, highlighting its potential in practical scenarios beyond worst-case predictions. Despite these improvements, Warm-Start QAOA with traditional parameters optimized for expectation value does not exceed the performance of the initial classical solution. To address this, we introduce an alternative parameter optimization objective, the Better Solution Probability (BSP) metric. Our results show that BSP-optimized Warm-Start QAOA identifies solutions at non-trivial tilt angles that are better than even the best classically found warm-start solutions with non-vanishing probabilities. These findings underscore the importance of both theoretical and empirical analyses in refining QAOA and exploring its potential for quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: We prove new Bernstein and Markov type inequalities in $L^p$ spaces associated with the normal and the tangential derivatives on the boundary of a general compact $C^\alpha$-domain with $1\leq \alpha\leq 2$. These estimates are also applied to establish Marcinkiewicz type inequalities for discretization of $L^p$ norms of algebraic polynomials on $C^\alpha$-domains with asymptotically optimal number of function samples used.</description>

      <title>Approximation in Hilbert spaces of the Gaussian and related analytic kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider linear approximation based on function evaluations in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of certain analytic weighted power series kernels and stationary kernels on the interval $[-1,1]$. Both classes contain the popular Gaussian kernel $K(x, y) = \exp(-\tfrac{1}{2}\varepsilon^2(x-y)^2)$. For weighted power series kernels we derive almost matching upper and lower bounds on the worst-case error. When applied to the Gaussian kernel, our results state that, up to a sub-exponential factor, the $n$th minimal error decays as $(\varepsilon/n)^n (n!)^{-1/2}$. The proofs are based on weighted polynomial interpolation and classical polynomial coefficient estimates.</description>

      <title>Parameter choice strategies for regularized least squares approximation of noisy continuous functions on the unit circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a trigonometric polynomial reconstruction of continuous periodic functions from their noisy values at equidistant nodes of the unit circle by a regularized least squares method. We indicate that the constructed trigonometric polynomial can be determined in explicit due to the exactness of trapezoidal rule. Then a concrete error bound is derived based on the estimation of Lebesgue constants. In particular, we analyze three regularization parameter choice strategies: Morozov's discrepancy principal, L-curve and generalized cross-validation. Finally, numerical examples are given to perform that well chosen parameters by above strategies can improve the quality of approximation significantly.</description>

      <title>High-accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the self-consistent field theory of liquid-crystalline polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is one of the most widely-used framework in studying the equilibrium phase behaviors of inhomogenous polymers. For liquid crystalline polymeric systems, the main numerical challenges of solving SCFT encompass efficiently solving plenty of six dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), precisely determining the subtle energy difference among self-assembled structures, and developing effective iterative methods for nonlinear SCF iteration. To address these challenges, this work introduces a suite of high-order and efficient numerical methods tailored for SCFT of liquid-crystalline polymers. These methods include various advaced PDE solvers, an improved Anderson iteration algorithm to accelerate SCFT calculations, and an optimization technique of adjusting the computational domain during the SCF iterations. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Based on these algorithms, we further explore the self-assembly behavior of liquid crystalline polymers through simulations in four, five, and six dimensions, uncovering intricate three-dimensional spatial structures.</description>

      <title>Learning PDEs from data on closed surfaces with sparse optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of underlying surface partial differential equation (PDE) from observational data has significant implications across various fields, bridging the gap between theory and observation, enhancing our understanding of complex systems, and providing valuable tools and insights for applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed physical-informed sparse optimization (PIS), for learning surface PDEs. Our approach incorporates both $L_2$ physical-informed model loss and $L_1$ regularization penalty terms in the loss function, enabling the identification of specific physical terms within the surface PDEs. The unknown function and the differential operators on surfaces are approximated by some extrinsic meshless methods. We provide practical demonstrations of the algorithms including linear and nonlinear systems. The numerical experiments on spheres and various other surfaces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simultaneously achieving precise solution prediction and identification of unknown PDEs.</description>

      <title>On the quadratic stability of asymmetric Hermite basis with application to plasma physics with oscillating electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze why the discretization of linear transport with asymmetric Hermite basis functions can be instable in quadratic norm. The main reason is that the finite truncation of the infinite moment linear system looses the skew-symmetry property with respect to the Gram matrix. Then we propose an original closed formula for the scalar product of any pair of asymmetric basis functions. It makes possible the construction of two simple modifications of the linear systems which recover the skew-symmetry property. By construction the new methods are quadratically stable with respect to the natural $L^2$ norm. We explain how to generalize to other transport equations encountered in numerical plasma physics. Basic numerical tests with oscillating electric fields of different nature illustrate the unconditional stability properties of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards the Use of Anderson Acceleration in Coupled Transport-Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of a magnetically confined fusion plasma over long time periods requires methods that can bridge the difference between transport and turbulent time scales. The nonlinear transport solver, Tango, enables simulations of very long times, in particular to steady state, by advancing each process independently with different time step sizes and couples them through a relaxed iteration scheme. We examine the use of Anderson Acceleration (AA) to reduce the total number of coupling iterations required by interfacing Tango with the AA implementation, including several extensions to AA, provided by the KINSOL nonlinear solver package in SUNDIALS. The ability to easily enable and adjust algorithmic options through KINSOL allows for rapid experimentation to evaluate different approaches with minimal effort. Additionally, we leverage the GPTune library to automate the optimization of algorithmic parameters within KINSOL. We show that AA can enable faster convergence in stiff and very stiff tests cases without noise present and in all cases, including with noisy fluxes, increases robustness and reduces sensitivity to the choice of relaxation strength.</description>

      <title>A conservative, implicit solver for 0D-2V multi-species nonlinear Fokker-Planck collision equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present an optimal implicit algorithm specifically designed to accurately solve the multi-species nonlinear 0D-2V axisymmetric Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPR) collision equation while preserving mass, momentum, and energy. Our approach relies on the utilization of nonlinear Shkarofsky's formula of FPR (FPRS) collision operator in terms of Legendre polynomial expansions. The key innovation lies in the introduction of a new function named King (Eq.(54)) with the adoption of the Legendre polynomial expansion for the angular direction and King function expansion for the velocity axis direction. The Legendre polynomial expansion will converge exponentially and the King method, a moment convergence algorithm, could ensure the conservation with high precision in discrete form. Additionally, a post-step projection to manifolds is employed to exactly enforce symmetries of the collision operators. Through solving several typical problems across various nonequilibrium configurations, we demonstrate the superior performance and high accuracy of our algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction coordinates (RCs) are low-dimensional representations of complex dynamical systems that capture their long-term dynamics. In this work, we focus on the criteria of lumpability and decomposability, previously established for assessing RCs, and propose a new flow matching approach for the analysis and optimization of reaction coordinates based on these criteria. This method effectively utilizes data to quantitatively determine whether a given RC satisfies these criteria and enables end-to-end optimization of the reaction coordinate mapping model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the loss function used in our approach and the operator error induced by dimension reduction.</description>

      <title>Complexity Guarantees for Nonconvex Newton-MR Under Inexact Hessian Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Newton-MR algorithm for nonconvex unconstrained optimization to the settings where Hessian information is approximated. Under a particular noise model on the Hessian matrix, we investigate the iteration and operation complexities of this variant to achieve appropriate sub-optimality criteria in several nonconvex settings. We do this by first considering functions that satisfy the (generalized) Polyak-\L ojasiewicz condition, a special sub-class of nonconvex functions. We show that, under certain conditions, our algorithm achieves global linear convergence rate. We then consider more general nonconvex settings where the rate to obtain first order sub-optimality is shown to be sub-linear. In all these settings, we show that our algorithm converges regardless of the degree of approximation of the Hessian as well as the accuracy of the solution to the sub-problem. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm with several alternatives on a few machine learning problems.</description>
