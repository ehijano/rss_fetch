      <title>Building a Mastodon Compatible Java Server for ActivityPub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol that has gained significant attention from the media for its ability to communicate through the Fediverse, short for the federated web. Servers such as Mastodon implement the ActivityPub protocol to communicate over the Fediverse. In this paper, we deconstruct the core protocols used to build the distributed servers of the Fediverse. We explore Mastodon's complex implementation of ActivityPub and created our own Mastodon instance using Java Spring Boot and ActivityPub to interoperate with Mastodon servers.</description>

      <title>Opinion de-polarization of social networks with GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, social media is the ground for political debate and exchange of opinions. There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</description>

      <title>DISHONEST: Dissecting misInformation Spread using Homogeneous sOcial NEtworks and Semantic Topic classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant rise in the spread of misinformation on online platforms such as Twitter. Oftentimes this growth is blamed on the idea of the "echo chamber." However, the behavior said to characterize these echo chambers exists in two dimensions. The first is in a user's social interactions, where they are said to stick with the same clique of like-minded users. The second is in the content of their posts, where they are said to repeatedly espouse homogeneous ideas. In this study, we link the two by using Twitter's network of retweets to study social interactions and topic modeling to study tweet content. In order to measure the diversity of a user's interactions over time, we develop a novel metric to track the speed at which they travel through the social network. The application of these analysis methods to misinformation-focused data from the pandemic demonstrates correlation between social behavior and tweet content. We believe this correlation supports the common intuition about how antisocial users behave, and further suggests that it holds even in subcommunities already rife with misinformation.</description>

      <title>Self-regulated Learning Processes in Secondary Education: A Network Analysis of Trace-based Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the capacity to self-regulate has been found to be crucial for secondary school students, prior studies often rely on self-report surveys and think-aloud protocols that present notable limitations in capturing self-regulated learning (SRL) processes. This study advances the understanding of SRL in secondary education by using trace data to examine SRL processes during multi-source writing tasks, with higher education participants included for comparison. We collected fine-grained trace data from 66 secondary school students and 59 university students working on the same writing tasks within a shared SRL-oriented learning environment. The data were labelled using Bannert's validated SRL coding scheme to reflect specific SRL processes, and we examined the relationship between these processes, essay performance, and educational levels. Using epistemic network analysis (ENA) to model and visualise the interconnected SRL processes in Bannert's coding scheme, we found that: (a) secondary school students predominantly engaged in three SRL processes -- Orientation, Re-reading, and Elaboration/Organisation; (b) high-performing secondary students engaged more in Re-reading, while low-performing students showed more Orientation process; and (c) higher education students exhibited more diverse SRL processes such as Monitoring and Evaluation than their secondary education counterparts, who heavily relied on following task instructions and rubrics to guide their writing. These findings highlight the necessity of designing scaffolding tools and developing teacher training programs to enhance awareness and development of SRL skills for secondary school learners.</description>

      <title>Temporal Triadic Closure: Finding Dense Structures in Social Networks That Evolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph G is c-closed if every two vertices with at least c common neighbors are adjacent to each other. Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and Wein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of time. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition of temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c common neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to each other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world temporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a subgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible edge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are defined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Rumor Detection on Social Media with Temporal Propagation Structure Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional methods for detecting rumors on social media primarily focus on analyzing textual content, often struggling to capture the complexity of online interactions. Recent research has shifted towards leveraging graph neural networks to model the hierarchical conversation structure that emerges during rumor propagation. However, these methods tend to overlook the temporal aspect of rumor propagation and may disregard potential noise within the propagation structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates temporal information by constructing a weighted propagation tree, where the weight of each edge represents the time interval between connected posts. Drawing upon the theory of structural entropy, we transform this tree into a coding tree. This transformation aims to preserve the essential structure of rumor propagation while reducing noise. Finally, we introduce a recursive neural network to learn from the coding tree for rumor veracity prediction. Experimental results on two common datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>"There Has To Be a Lot That We're Missing": Moderating AI-Generated Content on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12702v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has begun to alter how we work, learn, communicate, and participate in online communities. How might our online communities be changed by generative AI? To start addressing this question, we focused on online community moderators' experiences with AI-generated content (AIGC). We performed fifteen in-depth, semi-structured interviews with moderators of Reddit communities that restrict the use of AIGC. Our study finds that rules about AIGC are motivated by concerns about content quality, social dynamics, and governance challenges. Moderators fear that, without such rules, AIGC threatens to reduce their communities' utility and social value. We find that, despite the absence of foolproof tools for detecting AIGC, moderators were able to somewhat limit the disruption caused by this new phenomenon by working with their communities to clarify norms. However, moderators found enforcing AIGC restrictions challenging, and had to rely on time-intensive and inaccurate detection heuristics in their efforts. Our results highlight the importance of supporting community autonomy and self-determination in the face of this sudden technological change, and suggest potential design solutions that may help.</description>

      <title>Putting the Count Back Into Accountability: An Analysis of Transparency Data About the Sexual Exploitation of Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alarmist and sensationalist statements about the "explosion" of online child sexual exploitation or CSE dominate much of the public discourse about the topic. Based on a new dataset collecting the transparency disclosures for 16 US-based internet platforms and the national clearinghouse collecting legally mandated reports about CSE, this study seeks answers to two research questions: First, what does the data tell us about the growth of online CSE? Second, how reliable and trustworthy is that data? To answer the two questions, this study proceeds in three parts. First, we leverage a critical literature review to synthesize a granular model for CSE reporting. Second, we analyze the growth in CSE reports over the last 25 years and correlate it with the growth of social media user accounts. Third, we use two comparative audits to assess the quality of transparency data. Critical findings include: First, US law increasingly threatens the very population it claims to protect, i.e., children and adolescents. Second, the rapid growth of CSE report over the last decade is linear and largely driven by an equivalent growth in social media user accounts. Third, the Covid-19 pandemic had no statistically relevant impact on report volume. Fourth, while half of surveyed organizations release meaningful and reasonably accurate transparency data, the other half either fail to make disclosures or release data with severe quality issues.</description>

      <title>Accurate Link Prediction for Edge-Incomplete Graphs via PU Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an edge-incomplete graph, how can we accurately find the missing links? The link prediction in edge-incomplete graphs aims to discover the missing relations between entities when their relationships are represented as a graph. Edge-incomplete graphs are prevalent in real-world due to practical limitations, such as not checking all users when adding friends in a social network. Addressing the problem is crucial for various tasks, including recommending friends in social networks and finding references in citation networks. However, previous approaches rely heavily on the given edge-incomplete (observed) graph, making it challenging to consider the missing (unobserved) links during training. In this paper, we propose PULL (PU-Learning-based Link predictor), an accurate link prediction method based on the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. PULL treats the observed edges in the training graph as positive examples, and the unconnected node pairs as unlabeled ones. PULL effectively prevents the link predictor from overfitting to the observed graph by proposing latent variables for every edge, and leveraging the expected graph structure with respect to the variables. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PULL consistently outperforms the baselines for predicting links in edge-incomplete graphs.</description>

      <title>LISTN: Lexicon induction with socio-temporal nuance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-group language is an important signifier of group dynamics. This paper proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.</description>
