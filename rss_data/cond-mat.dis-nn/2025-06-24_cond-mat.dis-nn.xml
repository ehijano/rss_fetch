      <title>Specific-heat anomaly in frustrated magnets with vacancy defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by frustrated magnets and spin-liquid-candidate materials, we study the thermodynamics of a 2D geometrically frustrating magnet with vacancy defects. The presence of vacancies imposes constraints on the bulk spins, which freezes some of the degrees of freedom in the system at low temperatures. With increasing temperature, these constraints get relaxed, resulting in an increase in the system's entropy. This leads to the emergence of a peak in the heat capacity $C(T)$ of the magnet at a temperature determined by the concentration of the vacancy defects. To illustrate the emergence of such an anomaly, we compute analytically the heat capacity of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Ising model on the triangular lattice with vacancy defects. The presence of the vacancy leads to a peak in $C(T)$ at the temperature $T_\text{imp}=-6J/\ln n_\text{imp}$, where $J$ is the AFM coupling between the spins and $n_\text{imp}$ is the fraction of the missing sites.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Storage properties of a quantum perceptron"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent paper "Storage properties of a quantum perceptron" [Phys. Rev. E 110, 024127] considers a quadratic constraint satisfaction problem, motivated by a quantum version of the perceptron. In particular, it derives its critical capacity, the density of constraints at which there is a satisfiability transition. The same problem was considered before in another context (classification of geometrically structured inputs, see [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 120601; Phys. Rev. E 102, 032119; J. Stat. Mech. (2021) 113301]), but the results on the critical capacity drastically differ. In this note, I substantiate the claim that the derivation performed in the quantum scenario has issues when inspected closely, I report a more principled way to perform it and I evaluate the critical capacity of an alternative constraint satisfaction problem that I consider more relevant for the quantum perceptron rule proposed by the article in question.</description>

      <title>Disordered harmonic chain with random masses and springs: a combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study harmonic chains with i.i.d. random spring constants $K_n$ and i.i.d. random masses $m_n$. We introduce a new combinatorial approach which allows to derive a compact approximate expression for the complex Lyapunov exponent, in terms of the solutions of two transcendental equations involving the distributions of the spring constants and the masses. Our result makes easy the asymptotic analysis of the low frequency properties of the eigenmodes (spectral density and localization) for arbitrary disorder distribution, as well as their high frequency properties. We apply the method to the case of power-law distributions $p(K)=\mu\,K^{-1+\mu}$ with $0&lt;K&lt;1$ and $q(m)=\nu\,m^{-1-\nu}$ with $m&gt;1$ (with $\mu,\:\nu&gt;0$). At low frequency, the spectral density presents the power law $\varrho(\omega\to0)\sim\omega^{2\eta-1}$, where the exponent $\eta$ exhibits first order phase transitions on the line $\mu=1$ and on the line $\nu=1$. The exponent of the non disordered chain ($\eta=1/2$) is recovered when $\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n\rangle$ are both finite, i.e. $\mu&gt;1$ and $\nu&gt;1$. The Lyapunov exponent (inverse localization length) shows also a power-law behaviour $\gamma(\omega^2\to0)\sim\omega^{2\zeta}$, where the exponent $\zeta$ exhibits several phase transitions~: the exponent is $\zeta=\eta$ for $\mu&lt;1$ or $\nu&lt;1$ ($\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ or $\langle m_n\rangle$ infinite) and $\zeta=1$ when $\mu&gt;2$ and $\nu&gt;2$ ($\langle K_n^{-2}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n^2\rangle$ both finite). In the intermediate region it is given by $\zeta=\mathrm{min}(\mu,\nu)/2$. On the transition lines, $\varrho(\omega)$ and $\gamma(\omega^2)$ receive logarithmic corrections. Finally, we also consider the Anderson model with random couplings (random spring chain for ``Dyson type I'' disorder).</description>

      <title>AutomataGPT: Forecasting and Ruleset Inference for Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Hysteresis Experiments Performed on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on exotic spin systems that model quantum materials. However, quantum annealing experiments have yet to explore magnetic memory and hysteresis, features seemingly at odds with hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling, favoring forgetfulness. Here, we present a general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis in a transverse-field Ising model. We implement it on three D-Wave superconducting flux qubit annealers, using up to thousands of spins, and explore both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models across contrasting graph topologies. Crucially, we observe robust memory retention in hysteresis loops, establishing quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena. This approach enables many topics of future exploration including return point memory and hysteresis in frustrated or topologically ordered systems, thus broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Analyzing partially-polarized light with a photonic deep random neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks are emerging as a powerful and versatile tool for processing optical signals directly in the optical domain with superior speed, integrability, and functionality. Their application to optical polarization enables neuromorphic polarization sensors, but their operation is limited to fully-polarized light. Here, we demonstrate single-shot analysis of partially-polarized beams with a photonic random neural network (PRNN). The PRNN is composed of a series of optical layers implemented by a stack of scattering media and a few trainable digital nodes. The setup infers the degree-of-polarization and the Stokes parameters of the polarized component with precision comparable to off-the-shelf polarimeters. The use of several optical layers allows to enhance the accuracy, reduce the sensor size, and minimize digital costs, demonstrating the advantage of a deep optical encoder for processing polarization information. Our results point out photonic neural networks as fast, compact, broadband, low-cost polarimeters that are widely applicable from sensing to imaging.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth and information capacity in a quasiperiodic system with a single-particle mobility edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-Andr\'e (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-Andr\'e model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced scrambling and emergent symmetries in random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Polaritons in Disordered Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures, where collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create plasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons qualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with applications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from experimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle structural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in plasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has practical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle superlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires large system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic simulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale nanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their optical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic boundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the polaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton dispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of nanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking gold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping in ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong coupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit ultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient mutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation modestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce the polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Gibbs measures of disordered crystals up to the solid-liquid phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</description>

      <title>High-throughput development of flexible amorphous materials showing large anomalous Nernst effect via automatic annealing and thermoelectric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates high-throughput screening of flexible magnetic materials for efficient transverse thermoelectric conversion based on the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). The approach integrates automated annealing and contactless measurement of transport properties using lock-in thermography. We screen 151 Fe-based alloy ribbons with varying compositions and annealing conditions. Seven high-performance candidates with mechanical flexibility are identified, exhibiting anomalous Nernst coefficients of up to 4.8 uV/K, the highest value reported for flexible materials. Structural analysis reveals that ANE enhancement occurs universally near the first crystallization temperature of the Fe-based ribbons, without strong correlation with composition. Notably, the enhancement is also observed in samples without Cu or Fe nanoclusters, indicating that short-range atomic order in the amorphous matrix may play a role in ANE. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of high-throughput methodologies for discovering advanced ANE materials and provide new insights into thermoelectric conversion in disordered systems where conventional design principles fall short.</description>

      <title>Xenophobia based on a few attributes can impede society's cohesiveness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Xenophobic interactions play a role as important as homophilic ones in shaping many dynamical processes on social networks, such as opinion formation, social balance, or epidemic spreading. In this paper, we use belief propagation and Monte Carlo simulations on tree-like signed graphs to predict that a sufficient propensity to xenophobia can impede a consensus that would otherwise emerge via a phase transition. As the strength of xenophobic interactions and the rationality of individuals with respect to social stress decrease, this transition changes from continuous to discontinuous, with a strong dependence on the initial conditions. The size of the parameter region where consensus can be reached from any initial condition decays as a power-law function of the number of discussed topics.</description>

      <title>Flat bands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flat bands in anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians [Mallick et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians with an \(E=0\) flat band by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flat bands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered \(E=0\) flat bands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flat-band eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flat-band eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. These numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>A generalized neural tangent kernel for surrogate gradient learning</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

      <title>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</title>

Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</description>

      <title>Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory</title>

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</description>
