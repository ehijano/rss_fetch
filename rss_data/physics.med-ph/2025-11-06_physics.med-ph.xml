      <title>Fast SDE-based Monte Carlo dose calculation for proton therapy validated against Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To validate a newly proposed stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based model for proton beam energy deposition by comparing its predictions with those from Geant4 in simplified phantom scenarios. Approach: Building on previous work in Crossley et al. (2025), where energy deposition from a proton beam was modelled using an SDE framework, we implemented the model with standard approximations to interaction cross sections and mean excitation energies, which makes simulations easily adaptable to new materials and configurations. The model was benchmarked against Geant4 in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms. Main results: The SDE-based dose distributions agreed well with Geant4, showing range differences within 0.4 mm and 3D gamma pass rates exceeding 98% under 3%/2 mm criteria with a 1% dose threshold. The model achieved a computational speed-up of approximately fivefold relative to Geant4, consistent across different Geant4 physics lists. Significance: These results demonstrate that the SDE approach can reproduce accuracy comparable to high-fidelity Monte Carlo for proton therapy at a fraction of the computational cost, highlighting its potential for accelerating dose calculations and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Structural Stress as a Predictor of the Rate and Spatial Location of Aortic Growth in Uncomplicated Type B Aortic Dissection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of aortic expansion in uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (TBAD) can help identify patients who may benefit from timely thoracic endovascular aortic repair. This study investigates associations between biomechanical predictors derived from reduced-order fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis and aortic growth outcomes. Baseline and follow-up CT images from 30 patients with uncomplicated TBAD were obtained. For each patient, a reduced-order FSI analysis using the forward penalty stress computation method was performed on the baseline geometry. Aortic growth was quantified by registering baseline and follow-up surfaces using nonrigid registration. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between structural stress, wall shear stress (WSS), pressure and growth rate while accounting for inter-patient variability. Group comparison analyses were performed to evaluate spatial distributions of these biomechanical variables along the dissected aorta between patient groups categorized by optimal medical therapy (OMT) and aortic growth outcomes. Linear regression revealed a positive association between structural stress and aortic growth rate (p = 0.0003) and a negative association for WSS (p = 0.0227). Logistic regression yielded area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.7414, 0.5953, 0.4991, and 0.6845 for structural stress, WSS, pressure, and aortic diameter, respectively. Group comparisons showed significant regional differences in structural stress, but not in diameter, WSS, or pressure, between groups defined by aortic growth and OMT outcomes. These results indicate that structural stress is a promising predictor of both the rate and location of aortic growth in uncomplicated TBAD, which supports its use in risk stratification models to identify patients at higher risk of TBAD progression.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of a Position-Sensitive SiPM-based Gamma Camera for Intraoperative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The POSiCS camera is a handheld, small field-of-view gamma camera developed for multipurpose use in radio-guided surgery (RGS), with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as its benchmark application. This compact and lightweight detector (weighing approximately 350 g) can map tissues labeled with Tc-99m nanocolloids and guide surgeons to the location of target lesions. By enabling intraoperative visualization in close proximity to the surgical field, its primary objective is to minimize surgical interventional invasiveness and operative time, thereby enhancing localization accuracy and reducing the incidence of post-operative complications. The design and components of the POSiCS camera emphasize ergonomic handling and compactness, providing, at the same time, rapid image formation and a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. These features are compatible with routine operating-room workflow, including wireless communication with the computer and a real-time display to support surgeon decision-making.
  The spatial resolution measured at a source-detector distance of 0 cm was 1.9 +/- 0.1 mm for the high-sensitivity mode and 1.4 +/- 0.1 mm for the high-resolution mode. The system sensitivity at 2 cm was evaluated as 481 +/- 14 cps/MBq (high sensitivity) and 134 +/- 8 cps/MBq (high resolution). For both working modes, we report an energy resolution of approximately 20 percent, even though the high-resolution collimator exhibits an increased scattered component due to the larger amount of tungsten.</description>

      <title>Individualizing Glioma Radiotherapy Planning by Optimization of Data and Physics-Informed Discrete Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain tumor growth is unique to each glioma patient and extends beyond what is visible in imaging scans, infiltrating surrounding brain tissue. Understanding these hidden patient-specific progressions is essential for effective therapies. Current treatment plans for brain tumors, such as radiotherapy, typically involve delineating a uniform margin around the visible tumor on pre-treatment scans to target this invisible tumor growth. This "one size fits all" approach is derived from population studies and often fails to account for the nuances of individual patient conditions. We present the GliODIL framework, which infers the full spatial distribution of tumor cell concentration from available multi-modal imaging, leveraging a Fisher-Kolmogorov type physics model to describe tumor growth. This is achieved through the newly introduced method of Optimizing the Discrete Loss, where both data and physics-based constraints are softly assimilated into the solution. Our test dataset comprises 152 glioblastoma patients with pre-treatment imaging and post-treatment follow-ups for tumor recurrence monitoring. By blending data-driven techniques with physics-based constraints, GliODIL enhances recurrence prediction in radiotherapy planning, challenging traditional uniform margins and strict adherence to the Fisher-Kolmogorov partial differential equation model, which is adapted for complex cases.</description>

      <title>A One Dimensional (1D) Computational Fluid Dynamics Study of Fontan-Associated Liver Disease (FALD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fontan-Associated Liver Disease (FALD) is a disorder arising from hemodynamic changes and venous congestion in the liver. This disease is prominent in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Although HLHS patients typically survive into adulthood, they have reduced cardiac output due to their univentricular physiology (i.e., a Fontan circuit). As a result, they have insufficient blood delivery to the liver. In comparison, patients with double outlet right ventricle (DORV), also having a univentricular circuit, have lower incidence of FALD. In this study, we use a patient-specific, one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (1D-CFD) model to predict hemodynamics in the liver of an HLHS patient and compare predictions with an age- and size-matched DORV control patient. Additionally, we simulate FALD conditions in the HLHS patient to predict hemodynamic changes across various stages of disease progression. Our results show that the HLHS patient has a higher portal venous pressure compared to the DORV patient. This difference is exacerbated as FALD conditions progress. The wall shear stress (WSS) is also higher than normal for the HLHS patient, suggesting vascular remodeling. WSS decreases slightly under FALD conditions, consistent with the development of portal hypertension. Perfusion analysis gives insight into regions of liver tissue at risk for fibrosis development, showing increasing pressures and reduced flow throughout the liver tissue fed by the portal vein under FALD conditions. Our results provide insight into the specific hemodynamic changes in Fontan circulation that can cause FALD.</description>
