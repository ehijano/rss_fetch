      <title>A Phase-Field Approach to Fracture and Fatigue Analysis: Bridging Theory and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel, robust and efficient framework for fatigue crack-propagation that combines the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) with phase-field fracture (PFF). Contrary to cycle-by-cycle PFF approaches, this work relies on a single simulation and uses standard crack propagation models such as Paris' law for the material response, simplifying its parametrization.
  The core of the methodology is the numerical evaluation of the derivative of a specimen's compliance with respect to the crack area. To retrieve this compliance the framework relies on a PFF-FEM simulation, controlled imposing a monotonic crack growth. This control of the loading process is done by a new crack-control scheme which allows to robustly trace the complete equilibrium path of a crack, capturing complex instabilities. The specimen's compliance obtained from the PFF simulation enables the integration of Paris' law to predict fatigue life.
  The proposed methodology is first validated through a series of benchmarks with analytical solutions to demonstrate its accuracy. The framework is then applied to more complex geometries where the crack path is unknown, showing a very good agreement with experimental results of both crack paths and fatigue life.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Effects of Simultaneous Environmental Variables on Perovskite Synthesis and Device Performance via Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid rise in perovskite solar cell efficiency, poor reproducibility remains a major barrier to commercialization. Film crystallization and device performance are highly sensitive to environmental factors during fabrication, yet their complex interactions are not well understood. In this work, we present a systematic framework to investigate the influence of both individual and coupled environmental variables on device efficiency and crystallization kinetics. We developed an integrated fabrication platform with precise, independent control over ambient solvent partial pressure, absolute humidity, and temperature during spin-coating and thermal-annealing processes, respectively. Using the platform, we implemented a closed-loop Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently explore the multi-dimensional processing space. We mapped the impact of these environmental variables on device performance and identified coupled effects among them. In-situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements further validated these findings by revealing a nonlinear interaction between absolute humidity and solvent partial pressure during spin-coating, which affects crystallization dynamics. To isolate and quantify these interactions, we developed an interpretable machine learning approach that combines knowledge distillation with Shapley interaction analysis. The model revealed the contribution of each interaction varies across different processing conditions. Our study highlights the importance of integrated ambient sensing and control to achieve repeatable perovskite solar cells, and demonstrates the utility of combining active learning with interpretable machine learning to navigate complex, high-dimensional processing landscapes.</description>

      <title>Field-induced reversible phase transition and negative differential resistance in In2Se3 ferroelectric semiconducting FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide (In2Se3), a ferroelectric semiconductor, offers a unique platform for multifunctional nanoelectronics owing to the interplay between polarization dynamics, interlayer sliding, and structural polymorphism. Ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) provide an ideal architecture to harness this coupling. Here, we demonstrate gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios and hysteretic output conductance in In2Se3 FeS-FETs. Combining high-resolution electron microscopy with electrical transport measurements, we attribute the NDR to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance alpha-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging reveals that in-plane electric fields (Vd) drive interlayer sliding, rotational misalignments that generate Moire patterns, and intralayer shear-together producing stress induced phase transitions. Out-of-plane field however results in robust non-volatile polarization switching. These mechanistic insights highlight both the promise of two dimensional ferroelectric devices for multifunctional nanoelectronics and alternative computing paradigms, and the intrinsic limitations of In2Se3 field-effect transistors for conventional ferroelectric memory applications.</description>

      <title>Unusual ferromagnetic band evolution and high Curie temperature in monolayer 1T-CrTe2 on bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D van der Waals ferromagnets hold immense promise for spintronic applications due to their controllability and versatility. Despite their significance, the realization and in-depth characterization of ferromagnetic materials in atomically thin single layers, close to the true 2D limit, has been scarce. Here, a successful synthesis of monolayer (ML) 1T-CrTe2 is reported on a bilayer graphene (BLG) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, that the ferromagnetic transition is observed at the Curie temperature (TC) of 150 K in ML 1T-CrTe2 on BLG, accompanied by unconventional temperature-dependent band evolutions. The spectroscopic analysis and first-principle calculations reveal that the ferromagnetism may arise from Goodenough-Kanamori super-exchange and double-exchange interactions, enhanced by the lattice distortion and the electron doping from the BLG substrate. These findings provide pivotal insight into the fundamental understanding of mechanisms governing 2D ferromagnetism and offer a pathway for engineering higher TC in 2D materials for future spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electronic order induced symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results agree well with experiments and establish a framework for predicting large phonon magnetism in magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon coupling. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric Effect Dependent on Electric Field Direction in a Pyroelectric Ferrimagnet CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dependence of the static magnetoelectric (ME) effect on the external field direction in the pyroelectric-ferrimagnet CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$, a topic that remains largely unexplored compared to dynamical nonreciprocal ME effects. We measured the magnetization with respect to the inherent polarization and found that an external electric field stabilizes the ferrimagnetic phase when applied parallel to the polarization, and destabilizes it when antiparallel. These results clearly demonstrate the electric-field-direction dependent control of the static ME effect, suggesting a new route to enhancing ME effects in pyroelectric-magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Scanning photocurrent microscopy and its application to one- and two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical response of a material when illuminated with light is a key to many optoelectronic device applications. This so-called photoresponse typically has a non-uniform spatial distribution through the active device area, and the ability to spatially resolve the photoresponse enables an in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) is a method that allows the spatial mapping of the photoresponse by raster scanning a focused laser beam over the sample. SPCM is becoming more popular due to its simplicity and power in unraveling fundamental optoelectronic processes. In this review, first, we provide the fundamentals of SPCM to lay the basics for the subsequent discussions. Then, we focus on the literature that employs SPCM to identify the photoresponse of one- and two-dimensional materials. We discuss SPCM measurement results of common materials in detail and introduce a systematic approach to interpreting the SPCM measurements. We have given particular emphasis on the photothermal mechanisms that are excited by the focused laser beam and critically reviewed studies in the literature from the perspective of laser-induced heating of the electronic and the lattice degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of SPCM in determining the mechanisms leading to the photoresponse.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Mapping of Tracer Diffusivities Across Composition Space in Ternary NiAlTi and Quinary NiCoFeAlTi High-Entropy Alloy Using Diffusion Couple Experiments and Physics Informed Neural Network Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive experimental and physics informed neural network numerical inverse diffusion analysis is conducted in technologically important NiAlTi ternary and NiCoFeAlTi quinary solid solutions for estimating and extracting composition dependent diffusion coefficients. A systematic variation of tracer, intrinsic and interdiffusion coefficients with composition could be estimated in the ternary solid solution. Following, the possibility of producing Al Ti constant PB diffusion profiles keeping constant Ni, Co, Fe in the quinary system is demonstrated. The estimation of diffusion coefficients of all the elements at the Kirkendall marker plane of a single diffusion couple profile is elaborated. PINN optimisation parameters are established using self and impurity diffusion coefficients in Ni and tracer diffusion coefficients at the Kirkendall marker plane. The reliability of optimized parameters is validated by comparing with the interdiffusion coefficients estimated from binary NiTi, NiAl and PB diffusion profiles, indicating extendibility to even lower order systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the magnetic landscape of easily-exfoliable two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies.</description>

      <title>NiSi$_2$ as seed layer for epitaxial growth of NiAl and Cr on Si(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, metal layers cannot be grown epitaxially on Si due to the tendency of metals to react and form a silicide. Even in case the metal layer has a matching lattice symmetry and atomic distance, the Si/metal interface is disturbed by the silicide thus preventing epitaxial growth. One exception is NiAl which is known to grow epitaxially when deposited on Si(001). During the growth, NiAl reacts with Si to form NiSi$_2$. In this work, epitaxial NiAl is grown and significant silicidation is observed in accordance with previous reports. However, the role that this silicide plays as a template for the epitaxial growth of NiAl has not been clear to this date. We hypothesize that NiSi$_2$ acts as a necessary seed layer between the Si substrate and the NiAl layer. Additionally, NiSi$_2$ can be used as a seed layer for the epitaxial growth of other metals besides NiAl. This was tested by growing NiSi$_2$ seperately and replacing the NiAl layer with Cr. Growing Cr directly on Si(001) produced a polycrystalline layer. When NiSi$_2$ was used as a seed layer, the Cr layer was found to be a single crystal with Si(001)//Cr(001) and Si(100)//Cr(100). NiSi was also tried as seed layer for Cr and was found to produce a polycrystalline Cr layer. Using NiSi$_2$ as a seed layer could enable the growth of various epitaxial materials for industrial semiconductor applications.</description>

      <title>Composition-driven magnetic anisotropy and spin polarization in Mn$_2$Ru$_{1-x}$Ga Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the influence of Ru concentration on the lattice parameters, atomic magnetic moments, electronic structure, and magnetic anisotropy energy of the full Heusler L2$_1$-type Mn$_2$Ru$_{1-x_p}$Ga alloy, where x$_p$ = 0.0834 p with p=0,...,12. This study combines first-principles calculations with data-driven techniques from artificial intelligence, specifically principal component analysis (PCA), to reveal trends and correlations across multiple structural, magnetic, and electronic descriptors. For each composition, a set of inequivalent atomic configurations was fully optimized. Structurally, the relaxed lattices exhibit anisotropic expansion, with a pronounced elongation of the out-of-plane lattice parameter ($c$) relative to the in-plane lattice vectors, which promotes the development of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our results reveal that an out-of-plane easy axis emerges at intermediate Ru concentrations (25-28%), while low and high Ru levels favor an in-plane orientation or even vanishing anisotropy. The half-metallic character is also modulated by Ru content, appearing selectively at both ends of the composition range. Additionally, the ferrimagnetic coupling between Mn(4a) and Mn(4c) sublattices leads to nearly compensated magnetic moments below 50% Ru content, with a net moment close to zero around 30%. These findings open a pathway toward the design of tunable spintronic materials with co-optimized perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and half-metallicity, making Mn$_2$RuGa a promising candidate for magnetic tunnel junctions, magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) devices, and high-density magnetic storage applications.</description>

      <title>On the Electronic, Mechanical and Optical Properties of Superhard Cross-Linked Carbon Nanotubes (Tubulanes)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of six structures belonging to the Tubulanes-cross-linked carbon nanotube family. Our results highlight the remarkable anisotropic mechanical behavior of these materials, distinguishing them from isotropic structures, such as diamond. Notably, the 8-tetra-22 structure has a higher Young's modulus ($Y_M$) along the $z$-direction compared to diamond. Unlike diamonds, the mechanical properties of Tubulanes are direction-dependent, with significant variations in Young's Modulus (2.3 times). Additionally, the Poisson's ratio is highly anisotropic, with at least one direction exhibiting an approximately zero value. The inherent anisotropy of these materials enables tunable mechanical properties that depend on the direction of applied stress. Regarding their electronic properties, all Tubulane structures studied possess indirect electronic band gaps, dominated by $2p$ orbitals. The band dispersion is relatively high, with band gaps ranging from 0.46 eV to 2.74 eV, all of which are smaller than that of diamond. Notably, the 16-tetra-22 structure exhibits the smallest bandgap (0.46 eV), making it particularly interesting for electronic applications. Additionally, these structures exhibit porosity, which provides an advantage over denser materials, such as diamond. Considering the recent advances in the synthesis of 3D carbon-based materials, the synthesis of tubulane-like structures is within our present-day technological capabilities.</description>

      <title>Application of perturbation theory to finding vibrational frequencies of a spheroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply perturbation theory of boundary conditions, originally developed by A.B. Migdal and independently by S.A. Moszkowski for deformed atomic nuclei, to finding eigenfrequencies of Raman-active spheroidal modes of a spheroid from these of a sphere and compare the outcomes with the results of numerical calculations for CdSe and silver nanoparticles. The modes are characterized by the total angular momentum $j=2$ and are five-fold degenerate for a sphere but split into three distinct modes, characterized by the absolute value of the total angular momentum projection onto the spheroidal axis, in case of a spheroid. The perturbation method works well in case of the rigid boundary conditions, with the displacement field set to zero at the boundary, and accurately predicts the splittings when the spheroidal shape is close to a sphere, but fails in case of the stress-free boundary conditions.</description>

Here, we investigate hydrogels composed of hydrophobic colloidal soot particles -- carbon black (CB) -- and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a food-grade polymer functionalized with hydrophobic groups binding physically to CB. As described in [Legrand et al., Macromolecules 56, 2298-2308 (2023)], CB-CMC hydrogels exist in two flavors: either electrically conductive when featuring a percolated network of CB particles decorated by CMC, or insulating where isolated CB particles act as physical cross-linkers within the CMC matrix. We compare these two types of CB-CMC hydrogels under Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS), combining rheometry with Time-Resolved Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (TRUSAXS) and electrical conductivity measurements. Both types of hydrogels exhibit a "type III" yielding scenario, characterized by an overshoot in G'' and a monotonic decrease in G', although the underlying microscopic mechanisms differ markedly. Conductive CB-CMC hydrogels display a yield strain (6%) concomitant with a drop in DC conductivity, indicative of the macroscopic rupture of the percolated CB network at length scales larger than a few microns, beyond USAXS resolution. At larger strain amplitudes, the conductivity of the fluidized sample increases again, exceeding its initial value, consistent with shear-induced formation of a transient, dynamically percolated network of CB clusters. In contrast, insulating CB-CMC hydrogels exhibit a larger yield strain (60%), beyond which the sample flows and the average distance between CB particles decreases. This reorganization is concomitant with a more than tenfold increase in conductivity, although it remains below that of conductive hydrogels at rest.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic band flattening near the magic angle of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) is an emergent platform for exploring exotic quantum phases driven by the interplay between nontrivial band topology and strong electron correlations. Direct experimental access to its momentum-resolved electronic structure is essential for uncovering the microscopic origins of the correlated topological phases therein. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of tMoTe$_2$, revealing pronounced twist-angle-dependent band reconstruction shaped by orbital character, interlayer coupling, and moir\'e potential modulation. Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution, yet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the importance of electronic correlations. Notably, the hole effective mass at the K point exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on twist angle, peaking near 2{\deg}, consistent with band flattening at the magic angle predicted by continuum models. Via electrostatic gating and surface dosing, we further visualize the evolution of electronic structure versus doping, enabling direct observation of the conduction band minimum and confirm tMoTe$_2$ as a direct band gap semiconductor. These results establish a spectroscopic foundation for modeling and engineering emergent quantum phases in this moir\'e platform.</description>

      <title>Revisiting intrinsic spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride with r2SCAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide band gap, van der Waals material that is highly promising for solid-state quantum technologies as a host of optically addressable, paramagnetic spin defects. Intrinsic and extrinsic point defects provide a range of emission energies, but the atomic-level structures related to observed transitions are not fully characterised. In this work, intrinsic point defects in bulk hBN are modelled using density functional theory at the level of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA), considering their formation energies, electronic spectra and magnetic properties. The meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional r2SCAN is found to offer a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for specific properties, while its predictive performance for bound-exciton stability is limited when compared to higher-level hybrid functionals. This implies opportunities for its use in optimised, hierarchical computational defect screening workflows. Under revised criteria, VB-, BN0, Bi+ and Ni+ defects are identified as stable colour centres with zero-phonon emission within technologically desirable wavelengths, making them promising for use in quantum networks and sensors.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional flat bands and possible interlayer triplet pairing superconductivity in the alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31{\deg}. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moir\'e bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moir\'e bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moir\'e bulk systems.</description>

      <title>Projector Method for Nonlinear Light-Matter Interactions and Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic projector-based Feynman diagram framework that intrinsically encodes quantum geometry for nonlinear optical responses. By explicitly incorporating geometric quantities such as the quantum geometric tensor, quantum hermitian connection, and triple phase product, the method ensures component-wise gauge invariance and seamlessly extends to multiband systems, enabling accurate calculations of quantum geometry and nonlinear optical responses. We derive the projector formalism in Wannier function basis and implement the \textit{ab initio} calculations of shift current in GeS, demonstrating excellent agreement with the sum rule and Wilson loop approaches. This work extends projector-based representations within the Wannier functions basis, offering an efficient and reliable tool for investigating nonlinear light-matter interactions and quantum geometry in realistic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the multifaceted dynamic motion and three-dimensional (3D) spatial manipulation of organic micro ring resonators (MRRs). The MRRs are fabricated via surface-tension-assisted self-assembly of 2,2'-((1E,1'E)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))bis(3,5-dibromophenol) (HDBP), exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) emission and frequency comb-type whispering gallery modes. Interestingly, the MRRs are micromechanically reconfigurable into various strained architectures, including lifting, transferring, vertical standing, axial spinning, and wheel-like rolling, using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip. The MRRs retained their photonic traits throughout these dynamic motions, underscoring their mechanical robustness. Notably, the demonstration of axial spinning and rolling locomotion extends the manipulation capabilities beyond two-dimensional control, enabling complete 3D spatial control. These results establish a foundational platform for next-generation NLO mechanophotonic systems, where reconfigurable smart and soft photonic elements can be dynamically controlled with high spatial precision.</description>

      <title>Observation of the crossover from quantum fluxoid to half-quantum fluxoid in a chiral superconducting device</title>

Abstract: Topological superconductors are one of the intriguing material groups from the viewpoint of not only condensed matter physics but also industrial application such as quantum computers based on Majorana fermion. For the real application, developments of the thin-film topological superconductors are highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be a decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted by \pi with a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom possessed by topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Strong long-wavelength electron-phonon coupling in Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) has long been confounded by coexisting electron-phonon coupling in bulk materials. Although the ground state of an EI may be difficult to differentiate from density-wave orders or other structural instabilities, excited states offer distinctive signatures. One way to provide clarity is to directly inspect the phonon spectral function for long wavelength broadening due to phonon interaction with the high velocity EI phason. Here, we report that the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) EI candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ shows extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and softening in the semimetallic normal state. In contrast, such a behavior is completely absent in the broken symmetry state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and in the isostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, where the latter has a fully gapped normal state. By contrasting the expected phonon lifetimes in the BCS and BEC limits of a putative EI, our results suggest that the phase transition in Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ family is closely related to strong interband electron-phonon coupling. We experimentally determine the dimensionless coupling $\frac{g}{\omega_0}\sim10$, showing Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ as a rare "ultra-strong coupling" material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization and the experimental measurement of the Berry curvature in solids have become an increasingly relevant task in condensed matter physics. We present the theoretical prediction of a gate tunable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a non magnetic oxide interface as a hallmark of a non-trivial Berry curvature. The observed AHE at low-temperatures in the presence of a planar magnetic field comes from a multiband low-energy model with a generalized Rashba interaction that supports characteristic out-of-plane spin and orbital textures. We also discuss strategies for reconstructing the Berry curvature from the AHE non-linearities in (111) SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Techniques in frequency stabilization of lasers to fixed-spacer optical cavities have advanced to the point where the ultimate frequency stabilities are limited by thermal noise in the cavity materials for standard cavity configurations at room temperature. The use of spectral-hole burning (SHB) in laser stabilization has produced promising results in early experiments. In this letter we explore the thermal-noise limits to frequency stability in burned spectral holes. We compile known material parameters for a typical system used in SHB experiments (Eu 3+ doped Y 2 SiO 5 ) to make numerical estimates for the fundamental thermal-noise induced frequency instability in spectral-holes for the liquid-helium temperature and dilution temperature cases. These efforts can guide the design of future SHB experiments and clarify which important material parameters remain to be measured.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic pyrochlore and spinel materials with topological flat bands are of interest for their potential to exhibit a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (&lt; 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Thirteen are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state among the collinear configurations considered. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 of the screened materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA exceed 0.2 under the approximation of collinear magnetism. Notably, Ag2Pt2O7 exhibits a high AHA of 0.405 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized complex materials design by enabling rapid exploration of material configurational spaces via crystal structure prediction with ab initio accuracy. However, critical challenges persist in ensuring robust generalization to unknown structures and minimizing the requirement for substantial expert knowledge and time-consuming manual interventions. Here, we propose an automated crystal structure prediction framework built upon the attention-coupled neural networks potential to address these limitations. The generalizability of the potential is achieved by sampling regions across the local minima of the potential energy surface, where the self-evolving pipeline autonomously refines the potential iteratively while minimizing human intervention. The workflow is validated on Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary systems by exploring nearly 10 million configurations, demonstrating substantial speedup compared to first-principles calculations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating the exploration and discovery of complex multi-component functional materials.</description>

      <title>Role of long-range dipolar interactions in the simulation of the properties of polar crystals using effective atomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by novel approaches and computational techniques, second-principles atomic potentials are nowadays at the forefront of computational materials science, enabling large-scale simulations of material properties with near-first-principles accuracy. However, their application to polar materials can be challenging, particularly when longitudinal-optical phonon modes are active on the material, as accurately modeling such systems requires incorporating the long-range part of the dipole-dipole interactions. In this study, we challenge the influence of these interactions on the properties of polar materials taking BaTiO$_3$ as paradigmatic example. By comparing models with and without the long-range part of the electrostatic contributions in a systematic way, we demonstrate that even if these interactions are neglected, the models can still provide an overall good description of the material, though they may lead to punctual significant artifacts. Our results propose a pathway to identify when an atomistic potential may be inadequate and needs to be corrected through the inclusion of the long-range part of dipolar interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-1/2 C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>

Abstract: Nonreciprocal magnons, characterized by propagation with differing energies along the k and -k directions, are crucial for modern spintronics applications. However, their realization in van der Waals layered antiferromagnets remains elusive. In this letter, we report robust nonreciprocal magnon behavior in layered honeycomb antiferromagnets VPX3(X =S,Se,Te). Our results demonstrate that, in addition to their intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the nonreciprocity of magnons is strongly influenced by the layer number, interlayer coupling, and magnon-magnon interactions. More importantly, in such layered antiferromagnets, the magnon nonreciprocity exhibits an asymmetric periodic dependence on the Neel vector, offering a novel route for experimentally probing antiferromagnetic order parameters in the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Ions leaving no tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paths of swift heavy ions are typically traceable in solids, because of confined electronic interactions along the paths, inducing what is known in literature as 'ion tracks', i.e. nano-sized in cross-section cylindrical zones of modified material extending for microns in length. Such tracks readily form in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that, in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Identification of soft modes in amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ via first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.</description>

      <title>Representation of tensor functions using lower-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</description>

      <title>Crack Path Prediction with Operator Learning using Discrete Particle System data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated intrinsic topological superconductivity in Fermi arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that phonons can intrinsically mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we find that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a range of chemical potentials around the Weyl nodes. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave Cooper pairing in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we find a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the Fermi arcs, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and experimental TDPAC approach enlightening the $aftereffects$ phenomenon: probing electronic properties in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$:($^{111}$In$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd at the atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process has stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and check experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</description>

      <title>Laser-engineered $\Gamma$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.</description>
