      <title>Meta-analysis of Life Cycle Assessments for Li-Ion Batteries Production Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the environmental impact of Li-Ion batteries by quantifying manufacturing-related emissions and analyzing how electricity mix and production scale affect emission intensity. To this end, we conduct a meta-analysis of life cycle assessments on lithium-ion batteries published over the past two decades, categorizing them by year, battery chemistry, functional unit, system boundaries, and electricity mix. We then carry out a cradle-to-gate assessment for a nickel manganese cobalt 811 battery with a silicon-coated graphite anode, analyzing how variations in the carbon intensity of the electricity mix affect emissions, with case studies for China, South Korea, and Sweden. Finally, we develop a set of regression models that link annual battery production and the carbon intensity of China's electricity mix to the average mass-specific emissions observed each year. The meta-analysis shows a median global warming potential of 17.63 kg CO2-eq./kg of battery, with a standard deviation of 7.34. Differences in electricity mix mainly influence emissions from the energy-intensive cell production, particularly from cathode material processing. We found that a multivariate linear regression using production volume and the carbon intensity of the Chinese electricity mix as predictors explains emissions with moderate accuracy. The environmental impact of battery manufacturing can be reduced by using clean energy sources in production processes. However, achieving substantial reductions requires clean energy throughout the entire supply chain, as importing materials from regions with carbon-intensive electricity mixes can undermine these efforts. Our findings also highlight the emission-reducing effect of learning associated with increased production scale, supporting the integration of learning effects in future life cycle assessment models.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Extended Kalman Filters on Manifolds with Affine Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state estimation problems over the past sixty years. The classical formulation of the EKF is posed for nonlinear systems defined on global Euclidean spaces. The design methodology is regularly applied to systems on smooth manifolds by choosing local coordinates, however, it is well known that this approach is not intrinsic to the manifold and performance depends heavily on choosing 'good' coordinates. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter that is adapted to the specific geometry of the manifold in question. We show that an affine connection and the concepts of parallel transport, torsion, and curvature are the key geometric structures that allow the formulation of a suitable family of intrinsic Gaussian-like distributions and provide the tools to understand how to propagate state estimates and fuse measurements. This leads us to propose novel geometric modifications to the propagation and update steps of the EKF and revisit recent work on the geometry of the reset step. The relative performance of the proposed geometric modifications are benchmarked against classical EKF and iterated EKF algorithms on a simplified inertial navigation system with direct pose measurements and no bias.</description>

      <title>Towards Next-Generation Intelligent Maintenance: Collaborative Fusion of Large and Small Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of intelligent technologies, collaborative frameworks integrating large and small models have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing industrial maintenance. However, several challenges persist, including limited domain adaptability, insufficient real-time performance and reliability, high integration complexity, and difficulties in knowledge representation and fusion. To address these issues, an intelligent maintenance framework for industrial scenarios is proposed. This framework adopts a five-layer architecture and integrates the precise computational capabilities of domain-specific small models with the cognitive reasoning, knowledge integration, and interactive functionalities of large language models. The objective is to achieve more accurate, intelligent, and efficient maintenance in industrial applications. Two realistic implementations, involving the maintenance of telecommunication equipment rooms and the intelligent servicing of energy storage power stations, demonstrate that the framework significantly enhances maintenance efficiency.</description>

      <title>Field-of-View and Input Constrained Impact Time Guidance Against Stationary Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a guidance strategy to achieve time-constrained interception of stationary targets, taking into account both the bounded field-of-view (FOV) of seeker-equipped interceptors and the actuator's physical constraints. Actuator saturation presents a significant challenge in real-world systems, often resulting in degraded performance. However, since these limitations are typically known in advance, incorporating them into the guidance design can enhance overall performance. To address the FOV constraint, a time-to-go error-based approach is adopted. Furthermore, to incorporate the lateral acceleration constraints, the engagement kinematics are augmented with an input saturation model. Subsequently, the guidance strategy that constrains the lateral acceleration and the time-to-go values within their respective bounds is derived using Lyapunov stability concepts and the backstepping technique. Furthermore, a multi-stage approach is suggested to expand the achievable range of impact time. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme for different initial engagement geometries.</description>

      <title>RSMA-Enabled Covert Communications Against Multiple Spatially Random Wardens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates covert communication in a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based multi-user multiple-input single-output system, where the random locations of the wardens follow a homogeneous Poisson point process. To demonstrate practical deployment scenarios, imperfect channel state information at the transmitter is considered. Closed-form expressions for the statistics of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, along with the analytical formulations for the covertness constraint, outage probability, and effective covert throughput (ECT), are derived. Subsequently, an ECT maximization problem is formulated under covertness and power allocation constraints. This optimization problem is addressed using an alternating optimization-assisted genetic algorithm (AO-GA). Simulation results corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of RSMA over conventional multiple access schemes, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed AO-GA.</description>

      <title>Applying XAI based unsupervised knowledge discovering for Operation modes in a WWTP. A real case: AQUAVALL WWTP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and facility units involved in each case.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Filter for Relative Attitude and Target Angular Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative attitude and angular velocity between two rigid bodies is fundamental in aerospace applications such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking. In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results. The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for UAV-Based Medical Delivery with Temporal Logic Constraints and Convex Feasible Set Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing time-sensitive medical deliveries in urban environments. Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</description>

      <title>Direct Integration of Recursive Gaussian Process Regression Into Extended Kalman Filters With Application to Vapor Compression Cycle Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a real-time capable algorithm for the learning of Gaussian Processes (GP) for submodels. It extends an existing recursive Gaussian Process (RGP) algorithm which requires a measurable output. In many applications, however, an envisaged GP output is not directly measurable. Therefore, we present the integration of an RGP into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the combined state estimation and GP learning. The algorithm is successfully tested in simulation studies and outperforms two alternative implementations -- especially if high measurement noise is present. We conclude the paper with an experimental validation within the control structure of a Vapor Compression Cycle typically used in refrigeration and heat pumps. In this application, the algorithm is used to learn a GP model for the heat-transfer values in dependency of several process parameters. The GP model significantly improves the tracking performance of a previously published model-based controller.</description>

      <title>Data-driven nonlinear output regulation via data-enforced incremental passivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a data-driven regulator design that drives the output of a nonlinear system asymptotically to a time-varying reference and rejects time-varying disturbances. The key idea is to design a data-driven feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is incrementally passive with respect to the regulation error and a virtual input. By carefully designing the virtual input, we solve the data-driven nonlinear output regulation problem where the reference and disturbances are generated by a linear exosystem. The designed regulator is composed of an internal model and a passivation feedback controller characterized by a set of data-dependent linear matrix inequalities. The proposed data-driven method is also applied to stabilizing the non-zero equilibrium of a class of nonlinear systems with unknown equilibrium input. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees in Data-Driven Nonlinear Control: Conformal Robustness for Stability and Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a true-dynamics-agnostic, statistically rigorous framework for establishing exponential stability and safety guarantees of closed-loop, data-driven nonlinear control. Central to our approach is the novel concept of conformal robustness, which robustifies the Lyapunov and zeroing barrier certificates of data-driven dynamical systems against model prediction uncertainties using conformal prediction. It quantifies these uncertainties by leveraging rank statistics of prediction scores over system trajectories, without assuming any specific underlying structure of the prediction model or distribution of the uncertainties. With the quantified uncertainty information, we further construct the conformally robust control Lyapunov function (CR-CLF) and control barrier function (CR-CBF), data-driven counterparts of the CLF and CBF, for fully data-driven control with statistical guarantees of finite-horizon exponential stability and safety. The performance of the proposed concept is validated in numerical simulations with four benchmark nonlinear control problems.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning. Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines, particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission in future 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at https://github.com/Cherry0302/Enhanced-TR-SCO.</description>

Abstract: In this brief note, we investigate some constructions of Lyapunov functions for stochastic discrete-time stabilizable dynamical systems, in other words, controlled Markov chains. The main question here is whether a Lyapunov function in some statistical sense exists if the respective controlled Markov chain admits a stabilizing policy. We demonstrate some constructions extending on the classical results for deterministic systems. Some limitations of the constructed Lyapunov functions for stabilization are discussed, particularly for stabilization in mean. Although results for deterministic systems are well known, the stochastic case was addressed in less detail, which the current paper remarks on. A distinguishable feature of this work is the study of stabilizers that possess computationally tractable convergence certificates.</description>

      <title>PyGemini: Unified Software Development towards Maritime Autonomy Systems</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and certifiability of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) requires robust decision-making systems, supported by extensive simulation, testing, and validation across a broad range of scenarios. However, the current landscape of maritime autonomy development is fragmented -- relying on disparate tools for communication, simulation, monitoring, and system integration -- which hampers interdisciplinary collaboration and inhibits the creation of compelling assurance cases, demanded by insurers and regulatory bodies. Furthermore, these disjointed tools often suffer from performance bottlenecks, vendor lock-in, and limited support for continuous integration workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce PyGemini, a permissively licensed, Python-native framework that builds on the legacy of Autoferry Gemini to unify maritime autonomy development. PyGemini introduces a novel Configuration-Driven Development (CDD) process that fuses Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), data-oriented design, and containerization to support modular, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. The framework functions as a stand-alone application, cloud-based service, or embedded library -- ensuring flexibility across research and operational contexts. We demonstrate its versatility through a suite of maritime tools -- including 3D content generation for simulation and monitoring, scenario generation for autonomy validation and training, and generative artificial intelligence pipelines for augmenting imagery -- thereby offering a scalable, maintainable, and performance-oriented foundation for future maritime robotics and autonomy research.</description>

      <title>Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially in moving freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time- and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity of the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>Relax, Estimate, and Track: a Simple Battery State-of-charge and State-of-health Estimation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery management is a critical component of ubiquitous battery-powered energy systems, in which battery state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimations are of crucial importance. Conventional SOC and SOH estimation methods, especially model-based methods, often lack accurate modeling of the open circuit voltage (OCV), have relatively high computational complexity, and lack theoretical analysis. This study introduces a simple SOC and SOH estimation method that overcomes all these weaknesses. The key idea of the proposed method is to momentarily set the cell's current to zero for a few minutes during the charging, perform SOC and SOH estimation based on the measured data, and continue tracking the cell's SOC afterward. The method is based on rigorous theoretical analysis, requires no hyperparameter fine-tuning, and is hundreds of times faster than conventional model-based methods. The method is validated on six batteries charged at different C rates and temperatures, realizing fast and accurate estimations under various conditions, with a SOH root mean square error (RMSE) of around 3% and a SOC RMSE of around 1.5%. The data and codes are available at https://berkeley.box.com/s/jz1w6po2iqzzfy7irxd9ok47ku3tr86j.</description>

      <title>Aging-aware Energy Management for Residential Multi-Carrier Energy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to the nonlinear device dynamics, uncertainty, and computational issues. As such, energy management systems seek to decide set points for the primary control layer in the best way possible. The objective is to minimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with user requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). This paper presents a novel aging-aware day-ahead algorithm for electrified buildings. The proposed energy management algorithm incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed day-ahead algorithm can either cut-down on grid costs or extend battery lifetime (electric vehicle or static packs). Moreover, it exploits the differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25\% when using LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells. Finally the performance using aged batteries is also enhanced, with respect to the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On relaxing the N-Reachability Implicit Requirement in NMPC Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a proof of stability for Model Predictive Control formulations involving a prediction horizon that might be too short to meet the reachability condition generally invoked as a sufficient condition for closed-loop stability. This condition is replaced by a contraction condition on the stage cost. But unlike the contraction based existing formulations where the prediction horizon becomes a decision variable, the formulation proposed in this paper remains standard in that it uses constant and short prediction horizon. An illustrative example is provided to assess the relevance of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Functions for Nonlinear Disturbed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) have been extensively used in the control community. A well-known drawback is the absence of a systematic way to construct CLFs for general nonlinear systems, and the problem can become more complex with input or state constraints. Our preliminary work on constructing Control Lyapunov Value Functions (CLVFs) using Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis provides a method for finding a non-smooth CLF. In this paper, we extend our work on CLVFs to systems with bounded disturbance and define the Robust CLVF (R-CLVF). The R-CLVF naturally inherits all properties of the CLVF; i.e., it first identifies the "smallest robust control invariant set (SRCIS)" and stabilizes the system to it with a user-specified exponential rate. The region from which the exponential rate can be met is called the "region of exponential stabilizability (ROES)." We provide clearer definitions of the SRCIS and more rigorous proofs of several important theorems. Since the computation of the R-CLVF suffers from the "curse of dimensionality," we also provide two techniques (warmstart and system decomposition) that solve it, along with necessary proofs. Three numerical examples are provided, validating our definition of SRCIS, illustrating the trade-off between a faster decay rate and a smaller ROES, and demonstrating the efficiency of computation using warmstart and decomposition.</description>

      <title>Optimization Proxies using Limited Labeled Data and Training Time -- A Semi-Supervised Bayesian Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained optimization problems arise in various engineering systems such as inventory management and power grids. Standard deep neural network (DNN) based machine learning proxies are ineffective in practical settings where labeled data is scarce and training times are limited. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) based optimization proxy for this complex regime, wherein training commences in a sandwiched fashion, alternating between a supervised learning step for minimizing cost, and an unsupervised learning step for enforcing constraint feasibility. We show that the proposed semi-supervised BNN outperforms DNN architectures on important non-convex constrained optimization problems from energy network operations, achieving up to a tenfold reduction in expected maximum equality gap and halving the inequality gaps. Further, the BNN's ability to provide posterior samples is leveraged to construct practically meaningful probabilistic confidence bounds on performance using a limited validation data, unlike prior methods. The implementation code for this study is available at: https://github.com/kaarthiksundar/BNN-OPF/.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping schedule yields fast convergence rate despite potentially ill-conditioned neural tangent kernel matrices, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks in the near-initialization regime, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05749v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</description>

      <title>SafeAuto: Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle to connect high-level reasoning with low-level control, leading to suboptimal and sometimes unsafe behaviors. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which process both visual and textual data, offer an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. First, we introduce a Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss to improve low-level control signal predictions when values are represented as text. Second, to explicitly integrate safety knowledge, we develop a reasoning component that translates traffic rules into first-order logic (e.g., "red light $\implies$ stop") and embeds them into a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., Markov Logic Network) to verify predicted actions using recognized environmental attributes. Additionally, our Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model leverages video, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn from past driving experiences. Integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, enabling more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/SafeAuto.</description>
