      <title>Dianoga SIDM: galaxy cluster self-interacting dark matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims at assessing the impact of DM self-interactions on the properties of galaxy clusters. In particular, the goal is to study the angular dependence of the cross section by testing rare (large angle scattering) and frequent (small angle scattering) SIDM models with velocity-dependent cross sections. We re-simulate six galaxy cluster zoom-in initial conditions with a dark matter only run and with a full-physics setup simulations that includes a self-consistent treatment of baryon physics. We test the dark matter only setup and the full physics setup with either collisionless cold dark matter, rare self-interacting dark matter, and frequent self-interacting dark matter models. We then study their matter density profiles as well as their subhalo population. Our dark matter only SIDM simlations agree with theoretical models, and when baryons are included in simulations, our SIDM models substantially increase the central density of galaxy cluster cores compared to full-physics simulations using collisionless dark matter. SIDM subhalo suppression in full-physics simulations is milder compared to the one found in dark matter only simulations, because of the cuspier baryionic potential that prevent subhalo disruption. Moreover SIDM with small-angle scattering significantly suppress a larger number of subhaloes compared to large angle scattering SIDM models. Additionally, SIDM models generate a broader range of subhalo concentration values, including a tail of more diffuse subhaloes in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and a population of more compact subhaloes in the cluster cores.</description>

      <title>Spatial clustering of gravitational wave sources with $k$-nearest neighbour distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to quantify the clustering of gravitational wave (GW) transient sources and measure their spatial cross-correlation with the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe using the $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$NN) formalism. As a first application, we measure the nearest-neighbour distributions of 53 suitably selected Binary Black Hole (BBH) mergers detected in the first three observation runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and cross-correlate these sources with ~$1.7 \times 10^7$ galaxies and quasars from the WISE$\times$SuperCOSMOS all-sky catalogue. To determine the significance of the clustering signal while accounting for observational systematics in the GW data, we create 135 realisations of mock BBHs that are statistically similar to the observed BBHs but spatially unclustered. We find no evidence for spatial clustering or cross-correlation with LSS in the data and conclude that the present sky localisation and number of detections are insufficient to get a statistically significant clustering signal. Looking forward, the statistically large number of detections and the significant improvements in sky localisations expected from future observing runs of LIGO (including LIGO India) and the next generation of GW detectors will enable measurement of the BBH-LSS cross-correlation and open a new window into cosmology.</description>

      <title>A Semi-blind Reconstruction of the History of Effective Number of Neutrinos Using CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of redshift-dependent deviations in the contribution of relativistic degrees of freedom to the radiation budget of the cosmos, conventionally parameterized by the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$, from the predictions of the standard model. We expand the deviations $\Delta N_{\rm eff}(z)$ in terms of top-hat functions and treat their amplitudes as the free parameters of the theory to be measured alongside the standard cosmological parameters by the Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, as well as performing forecasts for futuristic CMB surveys such as PICO and CMB-S4. We reconstruct the history of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and find that with the current data the history is consistent with the standard scenario. Inclusion of the new degrees of freedom in the analysis increases $H_0$ to $68.71\pm 0.44$, slightly reducing the Hubble tension. With the smaller forecasted errors on the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}(z)$ parametrization modes from future CMB surveys, very accurate bounds are expected within the possible range of dark radiation models.</description>

      <title>Upcoming searches for decaying dark matter with ULTRASAT ultraviolet maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) can be tested via different astrophysical and cosmological probes. In particular, particles in the $\sim$ 9.5 - 30 eV mass range that decay into monochromatic photons, would contribute to the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the ultraviolet (UV) bandwidth. In this work, we show that an intriguing improvement to the constraints on such DDM models can come from broadband UV surveys, such as GALEX or the upcoming ULTRASAT satellite. These provide diffuse light maps of the UV EBL, integrated over a wide redshift range. The cross correlation between intensity fluctuations in these maps with a reference spectroscopic galaxy survey, can be used to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the EBL intensity; in this way, it is also possible to detect signatures of contributions from DDM. We forecast the constraining power of (GALEX+ULTRASAT)$\times$DESI, and we show they will be able to detect DDM with decay rate up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-26}\,{\rm s})$. In the context of axion-like particles (ALP), our forecasts can be converted to constraints on the ALP-photon coupling; our results show this technique will test ALP with coupling $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}})$, more than an order of magnitude better than current bounds in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

      <title>Blind QSO reconstruction challenge: Exploring methods to reconstruct the Ly$\alpha$ emission line of QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ line flux from high-$z$ QSOs can place constraints on the neutral hydrogen content of the intergalactic medium during reionisation. There are now $\gtrsim10$ different Ly$\alpha$ reconstruction pipelines using different methodologies to predict the Ly$\alpha$ line flux from correlations with the spectral information redward of Ly$\alpha$. However, there have been few attempts to directly compare the performance of these pipelines. Therefore, we devised a blind QSO challenge to compare these reconstruction pipelines on a uniform set of objects. Each author was provided de-identified, observed rest-frame QSO spectra with spectral information only redward of 1260\AA\ rest-frame to ensure unbiased reconstruction. We constructed two samples of 30 QSOs, from X-Shooter and SDSS both spanning $3.5&lt;z&lt;4.5$. Importantly, the purpose of this comparison study was not to champion a single, best performing reconstruction pipeline but rather to explore the relative performance of these pipelines over a range of QSOs with broad observational characteristics to infer general trends. In summary, we find machine learning approaches in general provide the strongest ``best guesses" but underestimate the accompanying statistical uncertainty, although these can be recalibrated, whilst pipelines that decompose the spectral information, for example principal component or factor analysis generally perform better at predicting the Ly$\alpha$ profile. Further, we found that reconstruction pipelines trained on SDSS QSOs performed similarly on average for both the X-Shooter and SDSS samples indicating no discernible biases owing to differences in the observational characteristics of the training set or QSO being reconstructed, although the recovered distributions of reconstructions for X-Shooter were broader likely due to an increased fraction of outliers.</description>

      <title>Testing Yukawa cosmology at the Milky Way and M31 galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the galaxy rotation curves through the Yukawa gravitational potential emerging as a correction of the Newtonian potential in extended theories of gravity. On the one hand, we consider the contribution of the galactic bulge, galactic disk, and the dark matter halo of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. On the other hand, we use modified Yukawa gravity to show that the rotational velocity of galaxies can be addressed successfully without the need for dark matter. In Yukawa gravity, we recover MOND and show that dark matter might be seen as an apparent effect due to the modification of the law of gravitation in terms of two parameters: the coupling constant $\alpha $ and the characteristic length $\lambda$. We thus test our theoretical scenario using the Milky Way and M31 rotation velocity curves. In particular, we place observational constraints on the free parameters of Yukawa cosmology through the Monte Carlo method and then compare our results with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by making use of Bayesian information criteria. Specifically, we find that $\lambda$ is constrained to be of the order of kpc, while cosmological data suggest $\lambda$ of the order of Gpc. To explain this discrepancy, we argue that there is a fundamental limitation in measuring $\lambda$ due to the role of quantum mechanics on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>BOSS Constraints on Massive Particles during Inflation: The Cosmological Collider in Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive particles leave imprints on primordial non-Gaussianity via couplings to the inflaton, even despite their exponential dilution during inflation: practically, the Universe acts as a Cosmological Collider. We present the first dedicated search for spin-zero particles using BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, as well as Planck CMB non-Gaussianity data. We demonstrate that some Cosmological Collider models are well approximated by the standard equilateral and orthogonal parametrization; assuming negligible inflaton self-interactions, this facilitates us translating Planck non-Gaussianity constraints into bounds on Collider models. Many models have signatures that are not degenerate with equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianity and thus require dedicated searches. Here, we constrain such models using BOSS three-dimensional redshift-space galaxy clustering data, focusing on spin-zero particles in the principal series and constraining their couplings to the inflaton at varying speed and mass, marginalizing over the unknown inflaton self-interactions. This is made possible through an improvement in Cosmological Bootstrap techniques and the combination of perturbation theory and halo occupation distribution models for galaxy clustering. Our work sets the standard for inflationary spectroscopy with cosmological observations, providing the ultimate link between physics on the largest and smallest scales.</description>

      <title>A catalog of 1.58 million clusters of galaxies identified from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys released data and available spectroscopic redshifts, we identify 1.58 million clusters of galaxies by searching for the overdensity of stellar mass distribution of galaxies within redshift slices around pre-selected massive galaxies, among which 877,806 clusters are found for the first time. The identified clusters have an equivalent mass of M_{500}&gt; 0.47*10^{14}~Msolar with an uncertainty of 0.2 dex. The redshift distribution of clusters extends to z~1.5, and 338,841 clusters have spectroscopic redshifts. Our cluster sample includes most of the rich optical clusters in previous catalogs, more than 95% massive Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and 90% ROSAT and eROSITA X-ray clusters. From the light distributions of member galaxies, we derive the dynamical state parameters for 28,038 rich clusters and find no significant evolution of the dynamical state with redshift. We find that the stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxies grows by a factor of 2 since z=1.</description>

      <title>Tightening the reins on non-minimal dark sector physics: Interacting Dark Energy with dynamical and non-dynamical equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reassessment of the state of Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) cosmology, namely models featuring a non-gravitational interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). To achieve high generality, we extend the dark sector physics by considering two different scenarios: a non-dynamical DE equation of state $w_0\neq-1$, and a dynamical $w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. In both cases, we distinguish two different physical regimes resulting from a phantom or quintessence equation of state. To circumvent early-time superhorizon instabilities, the energy-momentum transfer should occur in opposing directions within the two regimes, resulting in distinct phenomenological outcomes. We study quintessence and phantom non-dynamical and dynamical models in light of two independent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments - the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We analyze CMB data both independently and in combination with Supernovae (SN) distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon-Plus catalog and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Our results update and extend the state-of-the-art analyses, significantly narrowing the parameter space allowed for these models and limiting their overall ability to reconcile cosmological tensions. Although considering different combinations of data leaves some freedom to increase $H_0$ towards the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration, our most constraining dataset (CMB+BAO+SN) indicates that fully reconciling the tension solely within the framework of IDE remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Lensed Type Ia Supernova "Encore" at z=2: The First Instance of Two Multiply-Imaged Supernovae in the Same Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bright ($m_{\rm F150W,AB}$=24 mag), $z=1.95$ supernova (SN) candidate was discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging acquired on 2023 November 17. The SN is quintuply-imaged as a result of strong gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy cluster, detected in three locations, and remarkably is the second lensed SN found in the same host galaxy. The previous lensed SN was called "Requiem", and therefore the new SN is named "Encore". This makes the MACS J0138.0$-$2155 cluster the first known system to produce more than one multiply-imaged SN. Moreover, both SN Requiem and SN Encore are Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia), making this the most distant case of a galaxy hosting two SNe Ia. Using parametric host fitting, we determine the probability of detecting two SNe Ia in this host galaxy over a $\sim10$ year window to be $\approx3\%$. These observations have the potential to yield a Hubble Constant ($H_0$) measurement with $\sim10\%$ precision, only the third lensed SN capable of such a result, using the three visible images of the SN. Both SN Requiem and SN Encore have a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years of $\sim2030$, providing unprecedented baseline for time-delay cosmography.</description>

      <title>Mass calibration of DES Year-3 clusters via SPT-3G CMB cluster lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the stacked lensing signal in the direction of galaxy clusters in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) redMaPPer sample, using cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature data from SPT-3G, the third-generation CMB camera on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). We estimate the lensing signal using temperature maps constructed from the initial 2 years of data from the SPT-3G 'Main' survey, covering 1500 deg$^2$ of the Southern sky. We then use this signal as a proxy for the mean cluster mass of the DES sample. In this work, we employ three versions of the redMaPPer catalogue: a Flux-Limited sample containing 8865 clusters, a Volume-Limited sample with 5391 clusters, and a Volume&amp;Redshift-Limited sample with 4450 clusters. For the three samples, we find the mean cluster masses to be ${M}_{200{\rm{m}}}=1.66\pm0.13$ [stat.]$\pm0.03$ [sys.], $1.97\pm0.18$ [stat.]$\pm0.05$ [sys.], and $2.11\pm0.20$ [stat.]$\pm0.05$ [sys.]$\times{10}^{14}\ {\rm{M}}_{\odot }$, respectively. This is a factor of $\sim2$ improvement relative to the precision of measurements with previous generations of SPT surveys and the most constraining cluster mass measurements using CMB cluster lensing to date. Overall, we find no significant tensions between our results and masses given by redMaPPer mass-richness scaling relations of previous works, which were calibrated using CMB cluster lensing, optical weak lensing, and velocity dispersion measurements from various combinations of DES, SDSS and Planck data. We then divide our sample into 3 redshift and 3 richness bins, finding no significant tensions with optical weak-lensing calibrated masses in these bins. We forecast a $5.8\%$ constraint on the mean cluster mass of the DES Y3 sample with the complete SPT-3G surveys when using both temperature and polarization data and including an additional $\sim1400$ deg$^2$ of observations from the 'Extended' SPT-3G survey.</description>

      <title>A single-bubble source for gravitational waves in a cosmological phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum fluctuations of an expanding phase transition bubble give rise to gravitational wave (GW) emission, even when considering a single bubble, without bubble collisions or plasma effects. The ratio of GW energy to the total bubble energy reservoir increases with time as $\propto t$. If the bubble expands for long enough before percolation destroys it, back-reaction due to the GW emission becomes important after $t_{\rm br}\sim (16\pi^5) m_{\rm pl}^2R_0^3$, where $R_0$ is the bubble nucleation radius and $m_{\rm pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass. As seen by experiments today, the GW energy spectrum would appear blue. However, simple estimates suggest that the signal falls short of detection by even ambitious future experiments.</description>

      <title>Zooming in on the Circumgalactic Medium with GIBLE: the Topology and Draping of Magnetic Fields around Cold Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy to study and quantify the topology of magnetic field lines around cold gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). This simulation is a new addition to Project GIBLE, a suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with preferential super-Lagrangian refinement in the CGM, reaching an unprecedented (CGM) gas mass resolution of $\sim$ $225$ M$_\odot$. To maximize statistics and resolution, we focus on a sample of $\sim$ $200$ clouds with masses of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The topology of magnetic field lines around clouds is diverse, from threading to draping, and there is large variation in the magnetic curvature ($\kappa$) within cloud-background interfaces. We typically find little variation of $\kappa$ between upstream and downstream cloud faces, implying that strongly draped configurations are rare. In addition, $\kappa$ correlates strongly with multiple properties of the interface and the ambient background, including cloud overdensity and relative velocity, suggesting that cloud properties impact the topology of interface magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of modified gravity in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a fundamental flaw in the application of modified gravity theories in cosmology, taking $f(R)$ gravity as a paradigmatic example. This theory contains a scalar degree of freedom that couples to the matter stress-energy tensor but not to gravitational energy. However, when applied to cosmology this theory is unable to distinguish between gravitational and non-gravitational energy. Hence the cosmological version of the theory does not coincide with its own macroscopic average, and we show that this leads to order-one discrepancies. We argue that the same inconsistency is common to many other modified gravity theories with extra degrees of freedom. Our results put into question whether these theories can make sense as the cosmological average of a fundamental theory, hence challenging their physical significance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 2: Substructure and the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a large and growing interest in observations of small-scale structure in dark matter. We propose a new way to probe dark matter structures in the $\sim 10 - 10^8 \, M_\odot$ range. This allows us to constrain the primordial power spectrum over shorter distances scales than possible with direct observations from the CMB. For $k$ in the range $\sim 10 - 1000 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ our constraints on the power spectrum are orders of magnitude stronger than previous bounds.
  We also set some of the strongest constraints on dark matter isocurvature perturbations. Our method relies on the heating effect such dark matter substructures would have on the distribution of stars in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Many models of inflation produce enhanced power at these short distance scales and can thus be constrained by our observation. Further, many dark matter models such as axion dark matter, self-interacting dark matter and dissipative dark matter, produce dense structures which could be constrained this way.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Galaxy Cluster HI Mass Recovery with CHIME at Redshifts z = 1 and 2 via the IllustrisTNG Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a drift-scan interferometer designed to map the entire northern sky every 24 hours. The all-sky coverage and sensitivity to neutral hydrogen flux at intermediate redshifts makes the instrument a resource for other exciting science in addition to cosmology for which it was originally designed. Characterizing the contents of CHIME's beam-smoothed maps will aid in planning novel use-cases for the instrument, particularly those pertaining to galaxy evolution studies. Here, we demonstrate its utility for the study of the \ion{H}{i} content of stacked galaxy populations across environments. Focusing first on galaxy clusters, we use simulated data from the IllustrisTNG project to understand the relative contribution of objects that fall into CHIME's synthesized beam to the observed \ion{H}{i} flux using stacking analyses at a couple of representative redshifts. We find that there is an appreciable difference in the estimated stacked flux when galaxy clusters or cluster member galaxies are used as tracers compared to stacking on a general galaxy catalog. Stacking on galaxy clusters, we report that it is possible to recover an average $M_\mathrm{HI}$ for clusters as a function of redshift and selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Probing Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates. In the vicinity of the solar system, these ultralight particles are described as a superposition of plane waves, resulting in a stochastic field with amplitude fluctuations on scales determined by the velocity dispersion of dark matter. In this work, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave interferometers to the stochastic ultralight dark matter field within the frequentist framework. We derive the projected sensitivity of a single detector using the time-delay interferometry and find that the stochastic effect will only diminish the performance of the detector marginally, unlike searches in other contexts where significant reductions are found. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of detector network in two typical configurations. We find that the well-separated configuration, where the distance between two detectors exceeds the coherence length of dark matter, is the optimal choice for ultralight dark matter detection due to a less chance of missing signal. This contrasts with the detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background, where the co-located and co-aligned configuration is preferred. Our results may provide useful insights for potential joint observations involving gravitational-wave detectors like LISA, Taiji and TianQin.</description>

Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics in the solar system with tetrahedral spacecraft formations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tetrahedral configurations of spacecraft on unperturbed heliocentric orbits allow for highly precise observations of small spatial changes in the gravitational field, especially those affecting the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). The resulting high sensitivity may be used to search for new physics that could manifest itself via deviations from general relativistic behavior yielding a non-vanishing trace[GGT]. We study the feasibility of recovering the trace[GGT] with the sensitivity of O(1e-24 s^(-2)) -- the level where some of the recently proposed cosmological models may have observable effects in the solar system. We consider how local measurements provided by precision laser ranging and atom-wave interferometry can be used for that purpose. We report on a preliminary study of such an experiment and precision that may be reached in measuring the trace[GGT], with the assumption of drag-compensated spacecraft by atom interferometer measurements. For that, we study the dynamical behavior of a tetrahedral formation established by four spacecraft on heliocentric nearby elliptical orbits. We formulate the observational equations to measure the trace[GGT] relying only on the observables available within the formation: laser ranging and the Sagnac interferometry. We demonstrate that Sagnac observable is a mission enabling and allows to measure the angular frequency of the tetrahedral rotation with respect to an inertial reference frame with an accuracy much higher than that available from any other modern navigational techniques. We show that the quality of the science measurements is affected by the changes in tetrahedron's orientation and shape as spacecraft follow their orbits. We present the preliminary mission and instrument requirements needed to measure the trace[GGT] to the required accuracy and demonstrate the feasibility of satisfying the science objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose an observationally and theoretically consistent resolution of the cosmological constant problem: $\Lambda$ is a counterterm - with a running coupling - that balances the monopole celestial sky average of the kinetic energy of expansion of inhomogeneously distributed `small' cosmic voids. No other dark energy source is required. This solution relies on the first investigation of void statistics in cosmological simulations in full general relativity (arXiv:2403.15134). Results are consistent with parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction. Crucially, dynamical spatial curvature arises as time-varying spatial gradients of the kinetic spatial curvature, and depends directly on the void volume fraction. Its monopole average generates the cosmological term. This result potentially resolves the Hubble tension and offers new approaches to tackling other tensions and anomalies.</description>

      <title>CMB-S4: Iterative Internal Delensing and $r$ Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tightest constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can only be obtained after removing a substantial fraction of the lensing $B$-mode sample variance. The planned CMB-S4 experiment will remove the lensing $B$-mode signal internally by reconstructing the gravitational lenses from high-resolution observations. We document here a first lensing reconstruction pipeline able to achieve this optimally for arbitrary sky coverage. We make it part of a map-based framework to test CMB-S4 delensing performance and its constraining power on $r$, including inhomogeneous noise and two non-Gaussian Galactic polarized foreground models. The framework performs component-separation of the high-resolution maps, followed by the construction of lensing $B$-mode templates, which are then included in a parametric small-aperture maps cross-spectra-based likelihood for $r$. We find that the lensing reconstruction and framework achieve the expected performance, compatible with the target $\sigma(r) \simeq 5\cdot 10^{-4}$ in the absence of a tensor signal, after an effective removal of $92\%$ to $93\%$ of the lensing $B$-mode variance, depending on the simulation set. The code for the lensing reconstruction can also be used for cross-correlation studies with large-scale structures, lensing spectrum reconstruction, cluster lensing, or other CMB lensing-related purposes. As part of our tests we also demonstrate joint optimal reconstruction of the lensing potential with the lensing curl potential mode, second-order in the density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies in Scalar-Induced Gravitational-Wave Background from Inflaton-Curvaton Mixed Scenario with Sound Speed Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model to generate large anisotropies in the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background via sound speed resonance in the inflaton-curvaton mixed scenario. Cosmological curvature perturbations are not only exponentially amplified at a resonant frequency, but also preserve significant non-Gaussianity of local type described by $f_{\mathrm{nl}}$. Besides a significant enhancement of energy-density fraction spectrum, large anisotropies in SIGWs can be generated, because of super-horizon modulations of the energy density due to existence of primordial non-Gaussianity. A reduced angular power spectrum $\tilde{C}_{\ell}$ could reach an amplitude of $[\ell(\ell+1)\tilde{C}_{\ell}]^{1/2} \sim 10^{-2}$, leading to potential measurements via planned gravitational-wave detectors such as DECIGO. The large anisotropies in SIGWs would serve as a powerful probe of the early universe, shedding new light on the inflationary dynamics, primordial non-Gaussianity, and primordial black hole dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a cosmological bubble wall beyond the approximation of an infinitely thin wall. In a previous paper, we discussed the range of validity of this approximation and estimated the first-order corrections due to the finite width. Here, we introduce a systematic method to obtain the wall equation of motion and its profile at each order in the wall width. We discuss in detail the next-to-next-to-leading-order terms. We use the results to treat the growth of spherical bubbles and the evolution of small deformations of planar walls.</description>

Abstract: Accurate redshift calibration is required to obtain unbiased cosmological information from large-scale galaxy surveys. In a forward modelling approach, the redshift distribution n(z) of a galaxy sample is measured using a parametric galaxy population model constrained by observations. We use a model that captures the redshift evolution of the galaxy luminosity functions, colours, and morphology, for red and blue samples. We constrain this model via simulation-based inference, using factorized Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) at the image level. We apply this framework to HSC deep field images, complemented with photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020. The simulated telescope images include realistic observational and instrumental effects. By applying the same processing and selection to real data and simulations, we obtain a sample of n(z) distributions from the ABC posterior. The photometric properties of the simulated galaxies are in good agreement with those from the real data, including magnitude, colour and redshift joint distributions. We compare the posterior n(z) from our simulations to the COSMOS2020 redshift distributions obtained via template fitting photometric data spanning the wavelength range from UV to IR. We mitigate sample variance in COSMOS by applying a reweighting technique. We thus obtain a good agreement between the simulated and observed redshift distributions, with a difference in the mean at the 1$\sigma$ level up to a magnitude of 24 in the i band. We discuss how our forward model can be applied to current and future surveys and be further extended. The ABC posterior and further material will be made publicly available at https://cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab/ufig.html.</description>

      <title>Constraining $z\lesssim 2$ ultraviolet emission with the upcoming ULTRASAT satellite</title>

Abstract: The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) carries a huge astrophysical and cosmological content: its frequency spectrum and redshift evolution are determined by the integrated emission of unresolved sources, these being galaxies, active galactic nuclei, or more exotic components. The near-UV region of the EBL spectrum is currently not well constrained, yet a significant improvement can be expected thanks to the soon-to-be launched Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (ULTRASAT). Intended to study transient events in the $2300-2900\,{\rm \r{A}}$ observed band, this detector will provide wide field maps, tracing the UV intensity fluctuations on the largest scales. In this paper, we suggest how to exploit ULTRASAT to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the UV-EBL volume emissivity. We build upon the work of Chiang et al. (2019), where the Clustering-Based Redshift (CBR) technique was used to study diffuse light maps from GALEX. Their results showed the capability of the cross correlation between GALEX and SDSS spectroscopic catalogs in constraining the UV emissivity, highlighting how CBR is sensitive only to the extragalactic emissions, avoiding foregrounds and Galactic contributions. In our analysis, we introduce a framework to forecast the CBR constraining power when applied to ULTRASAT and GALEX in cross correlation with the 5-year DESI spectroscopic survey. We show that these will yield a strong improvement in the measurement of the UV-EBL volume emissivity. For $\lambda = 1500\,{\rm \r{A}}$,non-ionizing continuum below $z \sim 2$, we forecast a $1\sigma$ uncertainty $\lesssim 26\%\,(9\%)$ with conservative (optimistic) bias priors using ULTRASAT full-sky map; similar constraints can be obtained from its low-cadence survey, which will provide a smaller but deeper map. We finally discuss how these results will foster our understanding of UV-EBL models.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mass-richness relation of clusters from THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations</title>

Abstract: The main systematics in cluster cosmology is the uncertainty in the mass-observable relation. In this paper, we focus on the most direct cluster observable in optical surveys, i.e. richness, and constrain the intrinsic mass-richness (MR) relation of clusters in THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations with two runs: GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-X. We find that modeling the richness at fixed halo mass with a skewed Gaussian distribution yields a simpler and smaller scatter compared to the commonly used log-normal distribution. Additionally, we observe that baryon models have a significant impact on the scatter, while exhibiting no influence on the mass dependence and a slight effect on the amplitude in the MR relation. We select member galaxies based on both stellar mass $M_\star$ and absolute magnitude $\mathscr{M}$. We demonstrate that the MR relation obtained from these two selections can be converted to each other by using the $M_\star-\mathscr{M}$ relation. Finally, we provide a 7-parameter fitting result comprehensively capturing the dependence of the MR relation on both stellar mass cutoff and redshift.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of the redshift drift in FLRW universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Redshift drift is the phenomenon whereby the observed redshift between an emitter and observer comoving with the Hubble flow in an expanding FLRW universe will slowly evolve -- on a timescale comparable to the Hubble time. In a previous article [JCAP 04 (2020) 043; arXiv 2001.11964] three of the current authors had performed a cosmographic analysis of the redshift drift in a FLRW universe, temporarily putting aside the issue of dynamics (the Friedmann equations). In the current article we now add dynamics, still within the framework of an exact FLRW universe. We shall develop a suitable generic matter model and apply it to both standard FLRW and various dark energy models. Furthermore, we shall also present a section analyzing the utility of using alternative cosmographic variables to describe the redshift drift data.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes triggered by QCD axion bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in the center of galaxies, although the origin of their massive seeds is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the SMBHs formation from the QCD axion bubbles. In this case, the primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered as the seeds of SMBHs, which are generated from the QCD axion bubbles due to an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking after inflation. The QCD axion bubbles are formed when the QCD axion starts to oscillate during the QCD phase transition. We consider a general case in which the axion bubbles are formed with the bubble effective angle $\theta_{\rm eff}\in(0, \, \pi]$, leading to the minimum PBH mass $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^4-10^7)M_\odot$ for the axion decay constant $f_a\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{16})\, \rm GeV$. The PBHs at this mass region may account for the seeds of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic approach to the Schwinger production of scalar particles in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Schwinger pair creation of scalar charged particles by a homogeneous electric field in an expanding universe in the quantum kinetic approach. We introduce an adiabatic vacuum for the scalar field based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin solution to the mode equation in conformal time and apply the formalism of Bogolyubov coefficients to derive a system of quantum Vlasov equations for three real kinetic functions. Compared to the analogous system of equations previously reported in the literature, the new one has two advantages. First, its solutions exhibit a faster decrease at large momenta which makes it more suitable for numerical computations. Second, it predicts no particle creation in the case of conformally coupled massless scalar field in the vanishing electric field, i.e., it respects the conformal symmetry of the system. We identify the ultraviolet divergences in the electric current and energy-momentum tensor of produced particles and introduce the corresponding counterterms in order to cancel them.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Oscillations in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Gertsenshtein effect, the presence of a large external B-field may allow photons and gravitons to mix in a way that resembles neutrino oscillations and is even more similar to axion-photon mixing. Assuming a background B-field (or any field that behaves like one), we examine the Gertsenshtein mechanism in the context of FLRW expanding universe models, as well as de Sitter space. The conformal invariance of Maxwell's equations and the conformal noninvariance of the Einstein equations preclude the operation of the Gertsenshtein effect at all scales. In general we find for the matter- and radiation-dominated cases, graviton-oscillations are possible only at late conformal times or when the wavelengths are much shorter than the horizon ($k\eta \gg 1$), but that the time-dependent oscillations eventually damp out in any case. The presence of charged particles additionally damps out the oscillations. For the de Sitter universe, we find that oscillations are possible only at early conformal times ($\eta \ll H^{-1}$) and for wavelengths short compared to the Hubble radius, but eventually freeze in when wavelengths become longer than the Hubble radius. In principle a Gertsenshtein-like mechanism might influence the balance of particle species in an inflationary phase before freezing in; however, we find that in all our models the mixing length is larger than the Hubble radius. We discuss several possible remedies to this situation.</description>

      <title>Calibration requirement for Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal observation -- III. Bias and variance in uGMRT ELAIS-N1 field power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power spectrum of \HI 21-cm radiation is one of the promising probes to study large scale structure of the universe and understand galaxy formation and evolution. The presence of foregrounds, that are orders of magnitude larger in the same frequency range of the redshifted 21-cm signal has been one of the largest observational challenges. The foreground contamination also hinders the calibration procedures and introduces residual calibration errors in the interferometric data. It has been shown that the calibration errors can introduce bias in the 21-cm power spectrum estimates and introduce additional systematics. In this work, we assess the efficacy of 21-cm power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT Band-3 observations of the ELAIS-N1 field. We first evaluate the statistics of the residual gain errors and perform additional flagging based on these statistics. We then use an analytical method to estimate the bias and variance in the power spectrum. We found that (a) the additional flagging based on calibration accuracy help reduce the bias and systematics in the power spectrum, (b) the majority of the systematics at the lower angular scales, $\ell &lt; 6000$, are due to the residual gain errors, (c) for the uGMRT baseline configuration and system parameters, the variance is always higher than the bias in the power spectrum estimates. Based on our analysis we observe that for an angular multipole of $\ell \sim3000$, $2000$ hours of `on source time' is required with the uGMRT to detect redshifted 21-cm signal at $3-\sigma$ significance from a redshift of $2.55$. In this work we only consider the power spectrum measurement in the plane of the sky, an assessment of residual gain statistics and its effect on multifrequency angular power spectrum estimation for the uGMRT and the SKA like telescopes will be presented in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Smoothing and flattening the universe through slow contraction versus inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a systematic study, we use an equivalent pair of improved numerical relativity codes based on a tetrad-formulation of the classical Einstein-scalar field equations to examine whether slow contraction or inflation (or both) can resolve the homogeneity, isotropy and flatness problems. Our finding, based on a set of gauge/frame invariant diagnostics, is that slow contraction robustly and rapidly smooths and flattens spacetime beginning from initial conditions that are outside the perturbative regime of the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, whereas inflation fails these tests. We present new numerical evidence supporting the conjecture that the combination of ultralocal evolution and an effective equation-of-state with pressure much greater than energy density is the key to having robust and rapid smoothing. The opposite of ultralocality occurs in expanding spacetimes, which is the leading obstruction to smoothing following a big bang.</description>
