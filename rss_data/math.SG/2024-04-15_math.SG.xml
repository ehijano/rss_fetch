      <title>Reeb flows, pseudo-holomorphic curves and transverse foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectizations, as introduced by Hofer in 1993, and then developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder, have brought new insights to Hamiltonian dynamics, providing new approaches to some classical questions in Celestial Mechanics. This short survey presents some recent developments in Reeb dynamics based on the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectizations, focusing on transverse foliations near critical energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Fukaya's immersed Lagrangian Floer theory and microlocalization of Fukaya category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{Fuk}(T^*M)$ be the Fukaya category in the Fukaya's immersed Lagrangian Floer theory \cite{fukaya:immersed} which is generated by immersed Lagrangian submanifolds with clean self-intersections. This category is monoidal in that the product of two such immersed Lagrangian submanifolds remains to be a Lagrangian immersion with clean self-intersection. Utilizing this monoidality of Fukaya's immersed Lagrangian Floer theory, we prove the following generation result in this Fukaya category of the cotangent bundle, which is the counterpart of Nadler's generation result \cite{Nadler} for the Fukaya category generated by the exact embedded Lagrangian branes. More specifically we prove that for a given triangulation $\mathcal T = \{\tau_{\mathfrak a}\}$ fine enough the Yoneda module $$ \mathcal{Y}_{\mathbb L}: = hom_{\mathfrak{Fuk}(T^*M)}(\cdot, \mathbb L) $$ can be expressed as a twisted complex with terms $hom_{\mathfrak{Fuk}(T^*M)}(\alpha_M(\cdot), L_{\tau_{\mathfrak a}*})$ for any curvature-free (aka tatologically unostructed) object $\mathbb L$. Using this, we also extend Nadler's equivalence theorem between the dg category $Sh_c(M)$ of constructible sheaves on $M$ and the triangulated envelope of $\mathfrak{Fuk}^0(T^*M)$ to the one over the Novikov field $\mathbb K$.</description>

      <title>Elementary spectral invariants and quantitative closing lemmas for contact three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we defined an "elementary" alternative to the ECH capacities of symplectic four-manifolds, using max-min energy of holomorphic curves subject to point constraints, and avoiding the use of Seiberg-Witten theory. In the present paper we use a variant of this construction to define an alternative to the ECH spectrum of a contact three-manifold. The alternative spectrum has applications to Reeb dynamics in three dimensions. In particular, we adapt ideas from a previous joint paper with Edtmair to obtain quantitative closing lemmas for Reeb vector fields in three dimensions. For the example of an irrational ellipsoid, we obtain a sharp quantitative closing lemma.</description>

      <title>Crepant resolutions of stratified varieties via gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety with a stratification $\mathcal{S}$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties such that $X$ is locally a product along each stratum (e.g., a symplectic singularity). We prove that assigning to each open subset $U \subset X$ the set of isomorphism classes of locally projective crepant resolutions of $U$ defines an $\mathcal{S}$-constructible sheaf of sets. Thus, for each stratum $S$ and basepoint $s \in S$, the fundamental group acts on the set of germs of projective crepant resolutions at $s$, leaving invariant the germs extending to the entire stratum. Global locally projective crepant resolutions correspond to compatible such choices for all strata. For example, if the local projective crepant resolutions are unique, they automatically glue uniquely.
  We give criteria for a locally projective crepant resolution $\rho: \tilde X \to X$ to be globally projective. We show that the sheafification of the presheaf $U \mapsto \operatorname{Pic}(\rho^{-1}(U)/U)$ of relative Picard classes is also constructible. The resolution is globally projective only if there exist local relatively ample bundles whose classes glue to a global section of this sheaf. The obstruction to lifting this section to a global ample line bundle is encoded by a gerbe on the singularity $X$. We show the gerbes are automatically trivial if $X$ is a symplectic quotient singularity.
  Our main results hold in the more general setting of partial crepant resolutions, that need not have smooth source.
  We apply the theory to symmetric powers and Hilbert schemes of surfaces with du Val singularities, finite quotients of tori, multiplicative and Nakajima quiver varieties, as well as to canonical threefold singularities.</description>

      <title>Representability of Elliptic Moduli Problems in Derived $C^{\infty}$-Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of solutions of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations on manifolds in the framework of derived $C^{\infty}$-geometry. For an arbitrary smooth stack $S$, we define $S$-families of nonlinear PDEs acting between $S$-families of submersions over an $S$-family of manifolds and show that in case the family of PDEs is elliptic and the base family of manifolds is proper over $S$, then the moduli stack of solutions is relatively representable by quasi-smooth derived $C^{\infty}$-schemes over $S$. Along the way, we develop tools to analyse the local structure of families of mapping stacks between manifolds and explain how to compare mapping stacks in smooth and in derived geometry. To access the notion of a family of PDEs over an arbitrary smooth base stack, we introduce a formalism of stacks of relative jets. Finally, we show how natural ideas from (higher) topos theory can be leveraged to facilitate the application of nonlinear Fredholm analysis to derived stacks of solutions of elliptic PDEs.</description>
