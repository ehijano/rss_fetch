      <title>Securing RIS-Aided Wireless Networks Against Full Duplex Active Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the physical layer security of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless network in the presence of full-duplex active eavesdropping. In this scenario, the RIS cooperates with the Base Station (BS) to transfer information to the intended user while an active attacker attempts to intercept the information through a wiretap channel. In addition, the attacker sends jamming signals to interfere with the legitimate user's reception of the signal and increase the eavesdropping rate. Our objective is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamformers at the BS and RIS, respectively. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose a solution that decomposes it into two disjoint beamforming design sub-problems solved iteratively using Alternating Optimization (AO) techniques. Numerical analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of varying the number of active attacking antennas and elements of the RIS on the secrecy performance of the considered systems under the presence of jamming signals sent by the attacker. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the impact of jamming signals on physical layer security in RIS-aided wireless networks. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on RIS-aided wireless networks and highlights the need to address the effects of jamming and active eavesdropping signals in such systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Covert mmWave MIMO with Finite-Resolution DACs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hybrid beamforming design for covert millimeter wave multiple-input multiple-output systems with finite-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which impose practical hardware constraints not yet considered by the existing works and have negative impact on the covertness. Based on the additive quantization noise model, we derive the detection error probability of the warden considering finite-resolution DACs. Aiming at maximizing the sum covert rate (SCR) between the transmitter and legitimate users, we design hybrid beamformers subject to power and covertness constraints. To solve this nonconvex joint optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme based on fractional programming, quadratic transformation, and inner majorization-minimization methods to iteratively optimize the analog and digital beamformers. To reduce the computational complexity of the AO scheme, we propose a vector-space based heuristic (VSH) scheme to design the hybrid beamformer. We prove that as the number of antennas grows to be infinity, the SCR in the VSH scheme can approach the channel mutual information. Simulation results show that the AO and VSH schemes outperform the existing schemes and the VSH scheme can be used to obtain an initialization for the AO scheme to speed up its convergence.</description>

      <title>Beam Switching Based Beam Design for High-Speed Train mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For high-speed train (HST) millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, the use of narrow beams with small beam coverage needs frequent beam switching, while wider beams with small beam gain leads to weaker mmWave signal strength. In this paper, we consider beam switching based beam design, which is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the number of switched beams within a predetermined railway range subject to that the receiving signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) at the HST is no lower than a predetermined threshold. To solve this problem, we propose two sequential beam design schemes, both including two alternately-performed stages. In the first stage, given an updated beam coverage according to the railway range, we transform the problem into a feasibility problem and further convert it into a min-max optimization problem by relaxing the RSNR constraints into a penalty of the objective function. In the second stage, we evaluate the feasibility of the beamformer obtained from solving the min-max problem and determine the beam coverage accordingly. Simulation results show that compared to the first scheme, the second scheme can achieve 96.20\% reduction in computational complexity at the cost of only 0.0657\% performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication for Joint Image Transmission and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing communication efficiency. However, most existing research emphasizes single-task reconstruction, neglecting model adaptability and generalization across multi-task systems. In this paper, we propose a novel generative semantic communication system that supports both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Our approach builds upon semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at both the transmitter and receiver, with each semantic KB comprising a source KB and a task KB. The source KB at the transmitter leverages a hierarchical Swin-Transformer, a generative AI scheme, to extract multi-level features from the input image. Concurrently, the counterpart source KB at the receiver utilizes hierarchical residual blocks to generate task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the two task KBs adopt a semantic similarity model to map different task requirements into pre-defined task instructions, thereby facilitating the feature selection of the source KBs. Additionally, we develop a unified residual block-based joint source and channel (JSCC) encoder and two task-specific JSCC decoders to achieve the two image tasks. In particular, a generative diffusion model is adopted to construct the JSCC decoder for the image reconstruction task. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-task generative semantic communication system outperforms previous single-task communication systems in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cell Range Expansion in Multi-Band UAV Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper leverages stochastic geometry to model, analyze, and optimize multi-band unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks operating across low-frequency and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. We introduce a novel approach to modeling mmWave antenna gain in such networks, which allows us to better capture and account for interference in our analysis and optimization. We then propose a simple yet effective user-UAV association policy, which strategically biases users towards mmWave UAVs to take advantage of lower interference and wider bandwidths compared to low-frequency UAVs. Under this scheme, we analytically derive the corresponding association probability, coverage probability, and spectral efficiency. We conclude by assessing our proposed association policy through simulation and analysis, demonstrating its effectiveness based on coverage probability and per-user data rates, as well as the alignment between analytical and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Target Tracking: Statistics of Successive Successful Target Detection in Automotive Radar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric for stochastic geometry based analysis of automotive radar networks called target {\it tracking probability}. Unlike the well-investigated detection probability (often termed as the success or coverage probability in stochastic geometry), the tracking probability characterizes the event of successive successful target detection with a sequence of radar pulses. From a theoretical standpoint, this work adds to the rich repertoire of statistical metrics in stochastic geometry-based wireless network analysis. To optimize the target tracking probability in high interference scenarios, we study a block medium access control (MAC) protocol for the automotive radars to share a common channel and recommend the optimal MAC parameter for a given vehicle and street density. Importantly, we show that the optimal MAC parameter that maximizes the detection probability may not be the one that maximizes the tracking probability. Our research reveals how the tracking event can be naturally mapped to the quality of service (QoS) requirements of latency and reliability for different vehicular technology use-cases. This can enable use-case specific adaptive selection of radar parameters for optimal target tracking.</description>

      <title>Decoding convolutional codes over finite rings. A linear dynamical systems approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observable convolutional codes defined over Zpr with the Predictable Degree Property admits minimal input state output representations that behaves well under restriction of scalars. We make use of this fact to present Rosenthal's decoding algorithm for these convolutional codes. When combined with the Greferath-Vellbinger algorithm and a modified version of the Torrecillas-Lobillo-Navarro algorithm, the decoding problem reduces to selecting two decoding algorithms for linear block codes over a field. Finally, we analyze both the theoretical and practical error-correction capabilities of the combined algorithm,</description>

      <title>6G Takes Shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contours of 6G -- its key technical components and driving requirements -- are finally coming into focus. Through twenty questions and answers, this article defines the important aspects of 6G across four categories. First, we identify the key themes and forces driving the development of 6G, and what will make 6G unique. We argue that 6G requirements and system design will be driven by (i) the tenacious pursuit of spectral (bits/Hz/area), energy (bits/Joule), and cost (bits/dollar) efficiencies, and (ii) three new service enhancements: sensing/localization/awareness, compute, and global broadband/emergency connectivity. Second, we overview the important role of spectrum in 6G, what new spectrum to expect in 6G, and outline how the different bands will be used to provide 6G services. Third, we focus our attention on the 6G physical layer, including waveforms, MIMO advancements, and the potential use of deep learning. Finally, we explore how global connectivity will be achieved in 6G, through non-terrestrial networks as well as low-cost network expansion via disaggregation and O-RAN. Although 6G standardization activities will not begin until late 2025, meaning this article is by definition speculative, our predictions are informed by several years of intensive research and discussions. Our goal is to provide a grounded perspective that will be helpful to both researchers and engineers as we move into the 6G era.</description>

      <title>A Novel Q-stem Connected Architecture for Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has garnered significant research interest recently due to its ability to generalize existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures and provide enhanced performance through flexible inter-connection among RIS elements. However, current BD-RIS designs often face challenges related to high circuit complexity and computational complexity, and there is limited study on the trade-off between system performance and circuit complexity. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel BD-RIS architecture named Q-stem connected RIS that integrates the characteristics of existing single connected, tree connected, and fully connected BD-RIS, facilitating an effective trade-off between system performance and circuit complexity. Additionally, we propose two algorithms to design the RIS scattering matrix for a Q-stem connected RIS aided multi-user broadcast channels, namely, a low-complexity least squares (LS) algorithm and a suboptimal LS-based quasi-Newton algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed architecture is capable of attaining the sum channel gain achieved by fully connected RIS while reducing the circuit complexity. Moreover, the proposed LS-based quasi-Newton algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines, while the LS algorithm provides comparable performance with a substantial reduction in computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Statistic Maximal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a privacy measure called statistic maximal leakage that quantifies how much a privacy mechanism leaks about a specific secret, relative to the adversary's prior information about that secret. Statistic maximal leakage is an extension of the well-known maximal leakage. Unlike maximal leakage, which protects an arbitrary, unknown secret, statistic maximal leakage protects a single, known secret. We show that statistic maximal leakage satisfies composition and post-processing properties. Additionally, we show how to efficiently compute it in the special case of deterministic data release mechanisms. We analyze two important mechanisms under statistic maximal leakage: the quantization mechanism and randomized response. We show theoretically and empirically that the quantization mechanism achieves better privacy-utility tradeoffs in the settings we study.</description>

      <title>Surveying the space of descriptions of a composite system with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate information theory provides a general and principled framework for understanding how the components of a complex system are connected. Existing analyses are coarse in nature -- built up from characterizations of discrete subsystems -- and can be computationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose to study the continuous space of possible descriptions of a composite system as a window into its organizational structure. A description consists of specific information conveyed about each of the components, and the space of possible descriptions is equivalent to the space of lossy compression schemes of the components. We introduce a machine learning framework to optimize descriptions that extremize key information theoretic quantities used to characterize organization, such as total correlation and O-information. Through case studies on spin systems, Sudoku boards, and letter sequences from natural language, we identify extremal descriptions that reveal how system-wide variation emerges from individual components. By integrating machine learning into a fine-grained information theoretic analysis of composite random variables, our framework opens a new avenues for probing the structure of real-world complex systems.</description>

      <title>EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures and Kubo-Mori information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <title>Capacity Maximization for MIMO Channels Assisted by Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can improve the capacity of wireless communication links by passively beamforming the impinging signals in desired directions. This feature has been demonstrated both analytically and experimentally for conventional RISs, consisting of independently reflecting elements. To further enhance reconfigurability, a new architecture called beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed. It allows for controllable signal flows between RIS elements, resulting in a non-diagonal reflection matrix, unlike the conventional RIS architecture. Previous studies on BD-RIS-assisted communications have predominantly considered single-antenna transmitters/receivers. One recent work provides an iterative capacity-improving algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setups but without providing geometrical insights.
  In this paper, we derive the first closed-form capacity-maximizing BD-RIS reflection matrix for a MIMO channel. We describe how this solution pairs together propagation paths, how it behaves when the signal-to-noise ratio is high, and what capacity is achievable with ideal semi-unitary channel matrices. The analytical results are corroborated numerically.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Digital Twin Assisted Model Interference and Retraining over Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a resource allocation and model retraining problem for dynamic wireless networks by utilizing incremental learning, in which the digital twin (DT) scheme is employed for decision making. A two-timescale framework is proposed for computation resource allocation, mobile user association, and incremental training of user models. To obtain an optimal resource allocation and incremental learning policy, we propose an efficient two-timescale scheme based on hybrid DT-physical architecture with the objective to minimize long-term system delay. Specifically, in the large-timescale, base stations will update the user association and implement incremental learning decisions based on statistical state information from the DT system. Then, in the short timescale, an effective computation resource allocation and incremental learning data generated from the DT system is designed based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), thus reducing the network system's delay in data transmission, data computation, and model retraining steps. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-timescale scheme compared with benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Indoor VLC Network with Secure Downlink NOMA for Body Blockage Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of indoor visible light communication (VLC) networks based on power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for mobile devices, where multiple legitimate users are equipped with photodiodes (PDs). We propose a body blockage model for both the legitimate users and eavesdropper to address scenarios where the communication links from transmitting light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to receiving devices are blocked by the bodies of all parties. Furthermore, in order to improve the secrecy without requiring knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper, we propose a novel LED arrangement that reduces the overlapping areas covered by different LED units supporting distinct users. We also suggest two LED transmission strategies, i.e., simple and smart LED linking, and compare their performance with the conventional broadcasting in terms of transmission sum rate and secrecy sum rate. Through computer simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed strategies to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Galois Self-dual 2-quasi Constacyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field with cardinality $p^\ell$ and $0\neq \lambda\in F$, and $0\le h&lt;\ell$. Extending Euclidean and Hermitian inner products, Fan and Zhang introduced Galois $p^h$-inner product (DCC, vol.84, pp.473-492). In this paper, we characterize the structure of $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes over $F$; and exhibit necessary and sufficient conditions for $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes being Galois self-dual. With the help of a technique developed in this paper, we prove that, when $\ell$ is even, the Hermitian self-dual $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes are asymptotically good if and only if $\lambda^{1+p^{\ell/2}}=1$. And, when $p^\ell\,{\not\equiv}\,3~({\rm mod}~4)$, the Euclidean self-dual $2$-quasi $\lambda$-constacyclic codes are asymptotically good if and only if $\lambda^{2}=1$.</description>

      <title>Region-Specific Coarse Quantization with Check Node Awareness in 5G-LDPC Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents novel techniques for improving the error correction performance and reducing the complexity of coarsely quantized 5G-LDPC decoders. The proposed decoder design supports arbitrary message-passing schedules on a base-matrix level by modeling exchanged messages with entry-specific discrete random variables. Variable nodes (VNs) and check nodes (CNs) involve compression operations designed using the information bottleneck method to maximize preserved mutual information between code bits and quantized messages. We introduce alignment regions that assign the messages to groups with aligned reliability levels to decrease the number of individual design parameters. Group compositions with degree-specific separation of messages improve performance by up to 0.4 dB. Further, we generalize our recently proposed CN-aware quantizer design to irregular LDPC codes and layered schedules. The method optimizes the VN quantizer to maximize preserved mutual information at the output of the subsequent CN update, enhancing performance by up to 0.2 dB. A schedule optimization modifies the order of layer updates, reducing the average iteration count by up to 35 %. We integrate all new techniques in a rate-compatible decoder design by extending the alignment regions along a rate-dimension. Our complexity analysis shows that 2-bit decoding can double the area efficiency over 4-bit decoding without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>On the Achievable Error Rate Performance of Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication and Localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localisation (PASCAL) system. A scenario where multiple drones transmit communication signals to a base station (BS), which needs to simultaneously decode the signals and continuously locate the drones' positions during the communication session, is considered. The BS operates in two stages: first, it estimates the drones' location parameters using pilot signals; second, it performs data detection by reconstructing the channel response based on the estimated location parameters. The theoretical analysis presented demonstrates that the estimated location parameters follow Gaussian distributions with means equal to the actual values and variances determined by the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimator. Using these distributions, the average SER is derived to quantify the impact of localisation errors on decoding performance. This analysis highlights the synergy between communication and localisation, providing valuable insights into the influence of localisation inaccuracies on the performance of location-aware communication systems. Simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical derivations.</description>

      <title>Robust Max-Min Fair Beamforming Design for Rate Splitting Multiple Access-aided Visible Light Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the robust beamforming design for rate splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided visible light communication (VLC) networks with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). In particular, we first derive the theoretical lower bound for the channel capacity of RSMA-aided VLC networks. Then we investigate the beamforming design to solve the max-min fairness (MMF) problem of RSMA-aided VLC networks under the practical optical power constraint and electrical power constraint while considering the practical imperfect CSIT scenario. To address the problem, we propose a constrained-concave-convex programming (CCCP)-based beamforming design algorithm which exploits semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a penalty method to deal with the rank-one constraint caused by SDR. Numerical results show that the proposed robust beamforming design algorithm for RSMA-aided VLC network achieves a superior performance over the existing ones for space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Unreliable Entanglement Assistance: Interception and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic security is considered with unreliable entanglement assistance, due to one of two reasons: Interception or loss. We consider two corresponding models. In the first model, Eve may intercept the entanglement resource. In the second model, Eve is passive, and the resource may dissipate to the environment beyond her reach. We derive achievable rates for both models, subject to a maximal error criterion and semantic security. As an example, we consider the amplitude damping channel. Under interception, time division is not necessarily possible, and the boundary of our achievable region is disconnected. In the passive model, our rate region outperforms time division.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a nonadaptive strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of diffeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of diffeomorphism groups and their applications to problems in analysis and geometry has a long history. In geometric hydrodynamics, pioneered by V.~Arnold in the 1960s, one considers an ideal fluid flow as the geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain with respect to the metric defined by the kinetic energy. Similar considerations on the space of densities lead to a geometric description of optimal mass transport and the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. Likewise, information geometry associated with the Fisher-Rao metric and the Hellinger distance has an equally beautiful infinite-dimensional geometric description and can be regarded as a higher-order Sobolev analogue of optimal transportation. In this work we review various metrics on diffeomorphism groups relevant to this approach and introduce appropriate topology, smooth structures and dynamics on the corresponding infinite-dimensional manifolds. Our main goal is to demonstrate how, alongside topological hydrodynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics and optimal mass transport, information geometry with its elaborate toolbox has become yet another exciting field for applications of geometric analysis on diffeomorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Exciting Contact Modes in Differentiable Simulations for Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore an approach to actively plan and excite contact modes in differentiable simulators as a means to tighten the sim-to-real gap. We propose an optimal experimental design approach derived from information-theoretic methods to identify and search for information-rich contact modes through the use of contact-implicit optimization. We demonstrate our approach on a robot parameter estimation problem with unknown inertial and kinematic parameters which actively seeks contacts with a nearby surface. We show that our approach improves the identification of unknown parameter estimates over experimental runs by an estimate error reduction of at least $\sim 84\%$ when compared to a random sampling baseline, with significantly higher information gains.</description>
