      <description>arXiv:2507.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple model of shallow and wide neural networks, we show that the epigraph of its input-output map as a function of the network parameters approximates epigraph of a. convex function in a precise sense. This leads to a plausible explanation of their observed good performance.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Gaussian mixture models with piecewise-constant eigenvalue profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are ubiquitous in statistical learning, particularly for unsupervised problems. While full GMMs suffer from the overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces, spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.</description>

      <title>When Less Is More: Binary Feedback Can Outperform Ordinal Comparisons in Ranking Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A generative modeling / Physics-Informed Neural Network approach to random differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) techniques with uncertainty quantification (UQ) represents a rapidly evolving frontier in computational science. This work advances Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by incorporating probabilistic frameworks to effectively model uncertainty in complex systems. Our approach enhances the representation of uncertainty in forward problems by combining generative modeling techniques with PINNs. This integration enables in a systematic fashion uncertainty control while maintaining the predictive accuracy of the model. We demonstrate the utility of this method through applications to random differential equations and random partial differential equations (PDEs).</description>

      <title>Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD, two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid lengthy technical details.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage-Based Regressions with Many Related Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When using observational causal models, practitioners often want to disentangle the effects of many related, partially-overlapping treatments. Examples include estimating treatment effects of different marketing touchpoints, ordering different types of products, or signing up for different services. Common approaches that estimate separate treatment coefficients are too noisy for practical decision-making. We propose a computationally light model that uses a customized ridge regression to move between a heterogeneous and a homogenous model: it substantially reduces MSE for the effects of each individual sub-treatment while allowing us to easily reconstruct the effects of an aggregated treatment. We demonstrate the properties of this estimator in theory and simulation, and illustrate how it has unlocked targeted decision-making at Wayfair.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised learning for linear extremile regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremile regression, as a least squares analog of quantile regression, is potentially useful tool for modeling and understanding the extreme tails of a distribution. However, existing extremile regression methods, as nonparametric approaches, may face challenges in high-dimensional settings due to data sparsity, computational inefficiency, and the risk of overfitting. While linear regression serves as the foundation for many other statistical and machine learning models due to its simplicity, interpretability, and relatively easy implementation, particularly in high-dimensional settings, this paper introduces a novel definition of linear extremile regression along with an accompanying estimation methodology. The regression coefficient estimators of this method achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, which nonparametric extremile regression may not provide. In particular, while semi-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data to make more accurate predictions and avoid overfitting to small labeled datasets in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach to enhance estimation efficiency, even when the specified linear extremile regression model may be misspecified. Both simulation studies and real data analyses demonstrate the finite-sample performance of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Targeted tuning of random forests for quantile estimation and prediction intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel tuning procedure for random forests (RFs) that improves the accuracy of estimated quantiles and produces valid, relatively narrow prediction intervals. While RFs are typically used to estimate mean responses (conditional on covariates), they can also be used to estimate quantiles by estimating the full distribution of the response. However, standard approaches for building RFs often result in excessively biased quantile estimates. To reduce this bias, our proposed tuning procedure minimizes "quantile coverage loss" (QCL), which we define as the estimated bias of the marginal quantile coverage probability estimate based on the out-of-bag sample. We adapt QCL tuning to handle censored data and demonstrate its use with random survival forests. We show that QCL tuning results in quantile estimates with more accurate coverage probabilities than those achieved using default parameter values or traditional tuning (using MSPE for uncensored data and C-index for censored data), while also reducing the estimated MSE of these coverage probabilities. We discuss how the superior performance of QCL tuning is linked to its alignment with the estimation goal. Finally, we explore the validity and width of prediction intervals created using this method.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric learning of heterogeneous graphical model on network-linked data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical models have been popularly used for capturing conditional independence structure in multivariate data, which are often built upon independent and identically distributed observations, limiting their applicability to complex datasets such as network-linked data. This paper proposes a nonparametric graphical model that addresses these limitations by accommodating heterogeneous graph structures without imposing any specific distributional assumptions. The proposed estimation method effectively integrates network embedding with nonparametric graphical model estimation. It further transforms the graph learning task into solving a finite-dimensional linear equation system by leveraging the properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Moreover, theoretical guarantees are established for the proposed method in terms of the estimation consistency and exact recovery of the heterogeneous graph structures. Its effectiveness is also demonstrated through a variety of simulated examples and a real application to the statistician coauthorship dataset.</description>

      <title>Entropic optimal transport beyond product reference couplings: the Gaussian case on Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem with squared Euclidean cost consists in finding a coupling between two input measures that maximizes correlation. Consequently, the optimal coupling is often singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. Regularizing the optimal transport problem with an entropy term yields an approximation called entropic optimal transport. Entropic penalties steer the induced coupling toward a reference measure with desired properties. For instance, when seeking a diffuse coupling, the most popular reference measures are the Lebesgue measure and the product of the two input measures. In this work, we study the case where the reference coupling is not necessarily assumed to be a product. We focus on the Gaussian case as a motivating paradigm, and provide a reduction of this more general optimal transport criterion to a matrix optimization problem. This reduction enables us to provide a complete description of the solution, both in terms of the primal variable and the dual variables. We argue that flexibility in terms of the reference measure can be important in statistical contexts, for instance when one has prior information, when there is uncertainty regarding the measures to be coupled, or to reduce bias when the entropic problem is used to estimate the un-regularized transport problem. In particular, we show in numerical examples that choosing a suitable reference plan allows to reduce the bias caused by the entropic penalty.</description>

      <title>Generative flow-based warm start of the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) show promise for quantum simulations on near-term quantum devices, but are often limited by complex objective functions and expensive optimization procedures. Here, we propose Flow-VQE, a generative framework leveraging conditional normalizing flows with parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently generate high-quality variational parameters. By embedding a generative model into the VQE optimization loop through preference-based training, Flow-VQE enables quantum gradient-free optimization and offers a systematic approach for parameter transfer, accelerating convergence across related problems through warm-started optimization. We compare Flow-VQE to a number of standard benchmarks through numerical simulations on molecular systems, including hydrogen chains, water, ammonia, and benzene. We find that Flow-VQE outperforms baseline optimization algorithms, achieving computational accuracy with fewer circuit evaluations (improvements range from modest to more than two orders of magnitude) and, when used to warm-start the optimization of new systems, accelerates subsequent fine-tuning by up to 50-fold compared with Hartree--Fock initialization. Therefore, we believe Flow-VQE can become a pragmatic and versatile paradigm for leveraging generative modeling to reduce the costs of variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.</description>

      <title>LoRA Fine-Tuning Without GPUs: A CPU-Efficient Meta-Generation Framework for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning designed specifically for users with limited computational resources, particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection Methods Answer the Wrong Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment, since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective. Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their own fundamental limitations.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.</description>

      <title>A first-order method for nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems under a local Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition that may vary with the outer minimization variable. In contrast to the global KL or Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) conditions commonly assumed in the literature -- which are significantly stronger and often too restrictive in practice -- this local KL condition accommodates a broader range of practical scenarios. However, it also introduces new analytical challenges. In particular, as an optimization algorithm progresses toward a stationary point of the problem, the region over which the KL condition holds may shrink, resulting in a more intricate and potentially ill-conditioned landscape. To address this challenge, we show that the associated maximal function is locally H\"older smooth. Leveraging this key property, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for solving the minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed by applying a proximal gradient method to a KL-structured subproblem. Under mild assumptions, we establish complexity guarantees for computing an approximate stationary point of the minimax problem.</description>

      <title>Rank-1 Matrix Completion with Gradient Descent and Small Random Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonconvex formulation of the matrix completion problem has received significant attention in recent years due to its affordable complexity compared to the convex formulation. Gradient Descent (GD) is a simple yet efficient baseline algorithm for solving nonconvex optimization problems. The success of GD has been witnessed in many different problems in both theory and practice when it is combined with random initialization. However, previous works on matrix completion require either careful initialization or regularizers to prove the convergence of GD. In this paper, we study the rank-1 symmetric matrix completion and prove that GD converges to the ground truth when small random initialization is used. We show that in a logarithmic number of iterations, the trajectory enters the region where local convergence occurs. We provide an upper bound on the initialization size that is sufficient to guarantee the convergence, and show that a larger initialization can be used as more samples are available. We observe that the implicit regularization effect of GD plays a critical role in the analysis, and for the entire trajectory, it prevents each entry from becoming much larger than the others.</description>

      <title>Upper and lower bounds for the Lipschitz constant of random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01356v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical studies have widely demonstrated that neural networks are highly sensitive to small, adversarial perturbations of the input. The worst-case robustness against these so-called adversarial examples can be quantified by the Lipschitz constant of the neural network. In this paper, we study upper and lower bounds for the Lipschitz constant of random ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we assume that the weights and biases follow a generalization of the He initialization, where general symmetric distributions for the biases are permitted. For deep networks of fixed depth and sufficiently large width, our established upper bound is larger than the lower bound by a factor that is logarithmic in the width. In contrast, for shallow neural networks we characterize the Lipschitz constant up to an absolute numerical constant that is independent of all parameters.</description>

      <title>Is merging worth it? Securely evaluating the information gain for causal dataset acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merging datasets across institutions is a lengthy and costly procedure, especially when it involves private information. Data hosts may therefore want to prospectively gauge which datasets are most beneficial to merge with, without revealing sensitive information. For causal estimation this is particularly challenging as the value of a merge depends not only on reduction in epistemic uncertainty but also on improvement in overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the first cryptographically secure information-theoretic approach for quantifying the value of a merge in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We do this by evaluating the Expected Information Gain (EIG) using multi-party computation to ensure that no raw data is revealed. We further demonstrate that our approach can be combined with differential privacy (DP) to meet arbitrary privacy requirements whilst preserving more accurate computation compared to DP alone. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first privacy-preserving method for dataset acquisition tailored to causal estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method on a range of simulated and realistic benchmarks.

      <title>Long-Context Linear System Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of long-context linear system identification, where the state $x_t$ of a dynamical system at time $t$ depends linearly on previous states $x_s$ over a fixed context window of length $p$. We establish a sample complexity bound that matches the i.i.d. parametric rate up to logarithmic factors for a broad class of systems, extending previous works that considered only first-order dependencies. Our findings reveal a learning-without-mixing phenomenon, indicating that learning long-context linear autoregressive models is not hindered by slow mixing properties potentially associated with extended context windows. Additionally, we extend these results to (i) shared low-rank representations, where rank-regularized estimators improve the dependence of the rates on the dimensionality, and (ii) misspecified context lengths in strictly stable systems, where shorter contexts offer statistical advantages.</description>

      <title>Distribution Matching for Self-Supervised Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer learning method called \underline{\textbf{D}}istribution \underline{\textbf{M}}atching (DM), which drives the representation distribution toward a predefined reference distribution while preserving augmentation invariance. DM results in a learned representation space that is intuitively structured and therefore easy to interpret.
  Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrate that DM performs competitively on target classification tasks compared to existing self-supervised transfer learning methods. Additionally, we provide robust theoretical guarantees for DM, including a population theorem and an end-to-end sample theorem. The population theorem bridges the gap between the self-supervised learning task and target classification accuracy, while the sample theorem shows that, even with a limited number of samples from the target domain, DM can deliver exceptional classification performance, provided the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that perfect hallucination control in large language models is mathematically impossible. No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interpretable Models from Tree Ensembles: Computational and Statistical Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms existing algorithms for rule extraction.</description>

      <title>Fitting Sparse Markov Models to Categorical Time Series Using Convex Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order Markov chains are frequently used to model categorical time series. However, a major problem with fitting such models is the exponentially growing number of parameters in the model order. A popular approach to parsimonious modeling is to use a Variable Length Markov Chain (VLMC), which determines relevant contexts (recent pasts) of variable orders and forms a context tree. A more general parsimonious modeling approach is given by Sparse Markov Models (SMMs), where all possible histories of order $m$ are partitioned such that the transition probability vectors are identical for the histories belonging to any particular group. In this paper, we develop an elegant method of fitting SMMs based on convex clustering and regularization. The regularization parameter is selected using the BIC criterion. Theoretical results establish model selection consistency of our method for large sample size. Extensive simulation results under different set-ups are presented to study finite sample performance of the method. Real data analysis on modelling and classifying disease sub-types demonstrates the applicability of our method as well.</description>

      <title>A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</description>

      <title>Principal Graph Encoder Embedding and Principal Community Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of principal communities and propose a principal graph encoder embedding method that concurrently detects these communities and achieves vertex embedding. Given a graph adjacency matrix with vertex labels, the method computes a sample community score for each community, ranking them to measure community importance and estimate a set of principal communities. The method then produces a vertex embedding by retaining only the dimensions corresponding to these principal communities. Theoretically, we define the population version of the encoder embedding and the community score based on a random Bernoulli graph distribution. We prove that the population principal graph encoder embedding preserves the conditional density of the vertex labels and that the population community score successfully distinguishes the principal communities. We conduct a variety of simulations to demonstrate the finite-sample accuracy in detecting ground-truth principal communities, as well as the advantages in embedding visualization and subsequent vertex classification. The method is further applied to a set of real-world graphs, showcasing its numerical advantages, including robustness to label noise and computational scalability.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Vectorized MCMC on Modern Accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of automatic vectorization tools (e.g., JAX's $\texttt{vmap}$), writing multi-chain MCMC algorithms is often now as simple as invoking those tools on single-chain code. Whilst convenient, for various MCMC algorithms this results in a synchronization problem -- loosely speaking, at each iteration all chains running in parallel must wait until the last chain has finished drawing its sample. In this work, we show how to design single-chain MCMC algorithms in a way that avoids synchronization overheads when vectorizing with tools like $\texttt{vmap}$ by using the framework of finite state machines (FSMs). Using a simplified model, we derive an exact theoretical form of the obtainable speed-ups using our approach, and use it to make principled recommendations for optimal algorithm design. We implement several popular MCMC algorithms as FSMs, including Elliptical Slice Sampling, HMC-NUTS, and Delayed Rejection, demonstrating speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude in experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-reflective Uncertainties: Do LLMs Know Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response, uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs, the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. To support the development of this universal form of LLM uncertainties, we publish our metric at https://github.com/apple/ml-selfreflect</description>

      <title>Inherited or produced? Inferring protein production kinetics when protein counts are shaped by a cell's division history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring protein production kinetics for dividing cells is complicated due to protein inheritance from the mother cell. For instance, fluorescence measurements -- commonly used to assess gene activation -- may reflect not only newly produced proteins but also those inherited through successive cell divisions. In such cases, observed protein levels in any given cell are shaped by its division history. As a case study, we examine activation of the glc3 gene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under nutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot fluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects glc3 promoter activity. A na\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data ignoring cell division suggests many cells are active with low expression. Explicitly accounting for the (non-Markovian) effects of cell division and protein inheritance makes it impossible to write down a tractable likelihood -- a key ingredient in physics-inspired inference, defining the probability of observing data given a model. The dependence on a cell's division history breaks the assumptions of standard (Markovian) master equations, rendering traditional likelihood-based approaches inapplicable. Instead, we adapt conditional normalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn probability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods from simulated data. In doing so, we find that glc3 is mostly inactive under stress, showing that while cells occasionally activate the gene, expression is brief and transient.</description>
