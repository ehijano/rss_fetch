      <title>Observable Dynamics and the Generic Coincidence of Milnor, Statistical, and Physical Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the observable long-term behavior of typical continuous dynamical systems on the interval $[0,1]$. For a residual subset of $C([0,1])$, the Milnor, statistical, and physical (in the sense of Ilyashenko) attractors coincide and are equal to the non-wandering set. This unified attractor governs the time-averaged dynamics of almost all initial conditions and depends continuously on the map with respect to the Hausdorff metric. From the physical viewpoint, it represents the ensemble of observable steady states describing the long-term statistical behavior of the system. Nevertheless, it is not Lyapunov stable and contains no dense orbits, implying the generic absence of Palis attractors. Thus, generic continuous dynamics admit a well-defined observable attractor even when all classical mechanisms of stability fail, showing how observable statistical behavior persists in the absence of SRB measures or hyperbolic structure.</description>

      <title>On John Mather's Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: John Mather is a great scholar who was dedicated to mathematics in his whole life. His works in mathematics can be characterized as original and foundational. He laid out the foundation of singularity theory while he was a graduate student. He also laid out the foundation of modern Hamiltonian dynamical systems. Those fields became main stream in mathematics and it attracts many talents to pursue. His other works on characteristic classes, foliations, celestial mechanics, prime ends of conformal mappings are of the same quality with great influence in mathematics.</description>

      <title>Gluing polynomials along the cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gluing is a cut and paste construction where the dynamics of a map in a given domain is replaced by a different one, under the condition that the two agree along the gluing curve. Here we consider two polynomials with a finite super-attracting fixed point of the same degree. We prove that any two such non-renormalizable polynomials can be glued into a rational map along the Jordan boundary of the immediate basin of the super-attracting fixed point.</description>

      <title>Numerical bounds on the regularity of an invariant function: Probability of extinction of Galton-Watson processes in dynamical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lyapunov exponents of models that are close to skew product systems over a C__ uniformly expanding transformation of the circle. For a continuous fibre map $\phi$, analytic, increasing, and convex in the fibre variable, we consider the smallest invariant function q satisfying q(x) = $\phi$(x, q(T x)). We provide rigorous numerical bounds on two Lyapunov exponents (the fibre exponent and the base exponent), and present algorithms to compute these bounds effectively. We then apply this framework to Galton-Watson processes in dynamical environments in the uniformly supercritical case. The probability of extinction q of the process is the invariant function of the associated system. Using the previously computed Lyapunov exponents, we control the H{\"o}lder regularity and differentiability class of the probability of extinction.</description>

      <title>On topological properties of closed attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of an attractor has various definitions in the theory of dynamical systems. Under compactness assumptions, several of those definitions coincide and the theory is rather complete. However, without compactness, the picture becomes blurry. To improve our understanding, we characterize in this work when a closed, not necessarily compact, asymptotically stable attractor on a locally compact metric space is homotopy equivalent to its domain of attraction. This enables a further structural study of the corresponding feedback stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>Multistationarity in semi-open Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistationarity, underlies biochemical switching and cellular decision-making. We study how multistationarity in the sequential n-site phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is affected when only some species are open, meaning allowed to exchange with the environment (so-called semi-open networks). Working under mass action kinetics, we obtain two complementary structural results for every $n\geq 2$. First, opening any nonempty subset of the substrate species preserves the network's capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. Second, opening the enzyme species (both kinase and phosphatase), possibly together with any subset of substrates, always destroys multistationarity. The latter result is proved by a general reduction framework combining the detection of absolute concentration robustness (ACR) with projection onto the remaining species; when the projection is monostationary, the full semi-open system is monostationary. We also illustrate the general method on multi-layer cascade variants and discuss biological implications: opening enzymes acts as a robust switch that converts a potentially multistationary phosphorylation module into a monostationary one, while substrate exchange preserves switching capacity and thus the ability to couple cycles to downstream processes.</description>

      <title>Incremental Generation is Necessity and Sufficient for Universality in Flow-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.</description>

      <title>Fractional neural attention for efficient multiscale sequence processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\'evy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hausdorff dimension of irrationals with Lagrange value exactly 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized Hausdorff dimension of some natural subsets of $k^{-1}(3)$, where $k^{-1}(3)$ consists of the real numbers $x$ for which $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{(3+\varepsilon)q^2}$ has infinitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ for any $\varepsilon&lt;0$ but only finitely many for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. It is well known that $k^{-1}(3)$ is an uncountable set with Hausdorff dimension zero. Given any dimension function $h$, we determine the exact "cut point" at which the generalized Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{H}^h(k^{-1}(3))$ drops from infinity to zero. In particular we show that such a measure is always zero or not $\sigma$--finite, and, as an application, we can classify topologically $k^{-1}(3)$. Moreover, we show that the subset of attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has the same generalized Hausdorff dimension as $k^{-1}(3)$, but the subset of non--attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has a "strictly smaller" generalized Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Equations for Deep Linear Neural Networks: A Survey from a Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.</description>

      <title>On The Performance of Prefix-Sum Parallel Kalman Filters and Smoothers on GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental evaluation of parallel-in-time Kalman filters and smoothers using graphics processing units (GPUs). In particular, the paper evaluates different all-prefix-sum algorithms, that is, parallel scan algorithms for temporal parallelization of Kalman filters and smoothers in two ways: by calculating the required number of operations via simulation, and by measuring the actual run time of the algorithms on real GPU hardware. In addition, a novel parallel-in-time two-filter smoother is proposed and experimentally evaluated. Julia code for Metal and CUDA implementations of all the algorithms is made publicly available.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Laplace isospectral deformations within a conformal class of generic Liouville metrics on the two-dimensional torus that are linear in the deformation parameter are necessarily trivial. Two of the main ingredients in our proof are a noncancellation result for the wave trace and an analysis of the second order variational formula for the energy functional associated to closed geodesics. Noncancellation allows us to detect parts of the length spectrum from the Laplace spectrum and conclude rational integrability for the deformed geodesic flow (Liouville metrics are folklorically conjectured to be the only Riemannian metrics with integrable geodesic flow on the torus). We then use the second variational formula to show how the preservation of a single rational torus is sufficient to conclude triviality of the deformation, assuming linearity. We also present some evidence that our hypothesis of linearity may indeed be necessary.</description>

      <title>A 4-dimensional pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We know from previous work with Italiano and Migliorini that there exists some hyperbolic 5-manifold that fibers over the circle. Here we build one example where the monodromy is a "pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism" of the 4-dimensional fiber, in a way that is surprisingly similar to the familiar and beautiful two-dimensional picture of Nielsen and Thurston for surfaces. This fact has various consequences:
  (1) There is a compact smooth 4-manifold $M$ such that no non-trivial class in $H_2(M)$ is represented by immersed tori, and infinitely many classes are represented by smoothly embedded genus two surfaces.
  (2) There is a compact locally CAT(0) space $Y$ such that $\pi_1(Y)$ is not hyperbolic and does not contain $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$.
  The latter answers a question of Gromov, known as the Closing Flat Problem.</description>

      <title>CarboNet: A Finite-Time Combustion-Tolerant Compartmental Network for Tropospheric Carbon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While governments and international organizations have set the net-zero target to prevent a climate event horizon, practical solutions are lacking mainly because of the impracticability in completely replacing combustion processes. To address the net-zero target problem, in this paper we first design a compartmental network whose states must remain in the nonnegative orthant for physical consistency and in which the carbon dioxide emissions result from the combustion of diesel in vehicles and gas in house heaters. Then, we design both full-state and output-feedback linear-quadratic regulators of the compartmental network to bring the mass of carbon dioxide to the pre-industrial era, which is reached in approximately 25 and 60 days, respectively. The output-feedback controller tolerates for 6 days the combustion taking place in 5,000 vehicles and in 10,000 house heating systems, meets the net-zero target, and nullifies the extraction of finite natural resources. With closed-loop control, the tropospheric temperature stabilizes approximately to the pre-industrial era reference condition, i.e., to 13.5 {\deg}C, which is 21.7 {\deg}C lower than the steady-state temperature achieved without carbon capture. This work is a first step in designing optimal network control systems for climate stability. Source code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Bioeconomic Crop-Energy System with Energy Reinvestment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an optimal control model for allocating agricultural crop residues between bioenergy production and soil fertility restoration. The system captures a novel circular feedback: a fraction of cumulative energy output is reinvested into soil productivity, linking energy use with ecological regeneration. The dynamics are governed by a nonlinear three-state system describing soil fertility, residue biomass, and accumulated energy, with a single control representing the proportion of biomass diverted to energy. The objective is to maximize a discounted net benefit that accounts for energy revenue, soil value, and operational costs. We apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle in current-value form to derive necessary optimality conditions and characterize the structure of optimal controls. Numerical simulations based on direct optimization reveal interior and switching regimes, and show how planning horizon and reinvestment efficiency influence optimal strategies. The results highlight the strategic role of energy reinvestment in achieving sustainable residue management.</description>
