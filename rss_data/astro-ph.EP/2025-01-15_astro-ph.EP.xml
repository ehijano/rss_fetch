      <title>The coexistence of the streaming instability and the vertical shear instability in protoplanetary disks: Scale-dependence of dust diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical shear instability and the streaming instability are two robust sources of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. The former has been found to induce anisotropic turbulence that is stronger in the vertical than in the radial dimension and to be overall stronger compared to the largely isotropic turbulence caused by the streaming instability. In this study, we shed light on the dust diffusion by the vertical shear instability and the streaming instability separately and together, and in particular on the direction- and scale-dependence of the diffusion. To this end, we employ two-dimensional global models of the two instabilities either in isolation or in combination. The vertical shear instability in isolation diffuses dust more strongly in the vertical direction than the streaming instability in isolation, resulting in a wave-shaped dust layer in our two-dimensional simulations. Compared with this large-scale diffusion, though, our study highlights that the vertical shear instability causes substantially weaker or even negligible small-scale diffusion. We validate this result using previously published three-dimensional simulations. In particular when simulating centimetre-sized dust, the undulating dust layer becomes internally razor-thin. In contrast, the diffusion owing to the streaming instability exhibits only a marginal scale-dependence, with the dust layer possessing a Gaussian shape. In models including both instabilities, the undulating mid-plane layer is broadened to a width set by the intrinsic diffusion level caused by the streaming instability.</description>

      <title>The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Architecture Classification for Extrasolar Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a classification framework for the architectures of planetary systems based on a complete survey of the confirmed exoplanet population. With nearly 6000 confirmed exoplanets discovered, including more than 300 multiplanet systems with three or more planets, the current observational sample has reached the point where it is both feasible and useful to build a classification system that divides the observed population into meaningful categories. This framework provides a criterion to split planetary systems into inner and outer regimes, and then further divides inner systems into dynamical classes. The resulting categories include "peas-in-a-pod systems" with uniformly small planets and "warm Jupiter systems" with a mix of large and small planets, as well as "closely-spaced systems" and "gapped systems," with further subdivisions based on the locations of gaps and other features. These categories can classify nearly all of the confirmed systems with three or more planets with minimal ambiguity. We qualitatively examine the relative prevalence of each type of system, subject to observational selection effects, as well as other notable features such as the presence of hot Jupiters. A small number of outlier systems are also discussed. Potential additional classes of systems yet to be discovered are proposed.</description>

      <title>Vertical CO surfaces as a probe for protoplanetary disk mass and carbon depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the sample of mid-inclination disks with measured CO emission surfaces grows, a fundamental unanswered question is how these vertical profiles connect to their host properties. This project aims to relate the vertical extent of protoplanetary disks as traced by $^{12}$CO $2-1$ to key stellar and physical parameters. In order to produce a result that is applicable towards an observational analysis, we benchmark our results with ALMA observations of CO emission from nineteen disks. We produce a grid of disk models using the physical-chemical code DALI, for a template T Tauri and Herbig star. Our models use an iterative solver to calculate the hydrostatic equilibrium equations and determine a physically-motivated density structure. Key stellar and disk parameters such as stellar luminosity and temperature, total disk mass, carbon abundance and critical radius are varied to determine their effect on the CO emitting surface. Each vertical profile is fitted by an exponentially tapered power-law and characterized by the $z/r$ value that represents the structure inwards of 80% of the tapering radius. The CO emission surface location is primarily determined by the disk mass ($M_d$) and the level of volatile carbon depletion. T Tauri and Herbig systems show different vertical profiles, with disks around T Tauri stars being more vertically extended. We derive a $z/r$-$M_d$ relationship, which for each stellar type has a degeneracy with the volatile carbon abundance. In order to reconcile total disk mass estimates from the characteristic $z/r$ and the values obtained based on dust continuum analysis, a volatile carbon depletion of 10-100 (with respect to the ISM) is needed for the majority of our sources. Our carbon depletion values are in agreement with previous literature estimates, highlighting the potential of this method to rapidly calculate key disk parameters.</description>

      <title>A Disintegrating Rocky World Shrouded in Dust and Gas: Mid-IR Observations of K2-22b using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disintegrating ultra-short period rocky exoplanet K2-22b periodically emits dusty clouds in a dynamically chaotic process resulting in a variable transit depth from 0-1.3%. The effluents that sublimate off the surface and condense out in space are probably representative of the formerly interior layers convectively transported to the molten surface. Transmission spectroscopy of these transiting clouds reveal spectral fingerprints of the interior composition of this rocky world. We used JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) as a low-resolution slitless spectrograph to observe four predicted transit windows for K2-22b. For each observation, we extracted a transmission spectrum over the spectral range of 4.3-11.8 $\mu$m. We detect one transit at high significance and two at low significance. We find that the data 1) disfavor featureless, iron-dominated core material, 2) are consistent with some form of magnesium silicate minerals, likely from mantle material, and 3) show a distinct and unexpected feature at $\sim$5 $\mu$m. The unexpected feature, also seen weakly in the low-significance transits, is consistent with some gas features, possibly NO and/or CO$_2$. These findings warrant further study to improve the constraints on the composition of this disintegrating rocky world.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Imaging: Hide and Seek with Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: So far, most of the about 5700 exoplanets have been discovered mainly with radial velocity and transit methods. These techniques are sensitive to planets in close orbits, not being able to probe large star--planet separations. $\mu$-lensing is the indirect method that allows us to probe the planetary systems at the snow-line and beyond, but it is not a repeatable observation. On the contrary, direct imaging (DI) allows for the detection and characterization of low mass companions at wide separation (\mbox{$\leq$ 5--6 au}). The main challenge of DI is that a typical planet--star contrast ranges from $10^{-6}$, for a young Jupiter in emitted light, to $10^{-9}$ for Earth in reflected light. In the last two decades, a lot of efforts have been dedicated to combining large (D $\geq$ 5 m) telescopes (to reduce the impact of diffraction) with coronagraphs and high-order adaptive optics (to correct phase errors induced by atmospheric turbulence), with sophisticated image post-processing, to reach such a contrast between the star and the planet in order to detect and characterize cooler and closer companions to nearby stars. Building on the first pioneering instrumentation, the second generation of high-contrast imagers, SPHERE, GPI, and SCExAO, allowed us to probe hundreds of stars (e.g., 500--600 stars using SHINE and GPIES), contributing to a better understanding of the demography and the occurrence of planetary systems. The DI offers a possible clear vision for studying the formation and physical properties of gas giant planets and brown dwarfs, and the future DI (space and ground-based) instruments with deeper detection limits will enhance this vision. In this paper, we briefly review the methods, the instruments, the main sample of targeted stars, the remarkable results, and the perspective of this rising technique.</description>

      <title>On the features of great Forbush effect during May 2024 extreme geomagnetic storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates the features of galactic cosmic ray density and anisotropy behavior and their relation to solar sources, interplanetary and geomagnetic disturbances from May 8 to May 13, 2024. During this time, powerful solar flares and fast CMEs were recorded, leading to registration of an extreme geomagnetic storm along with one of the most significant Forbush effects for the entire observation period. All the calculations of cosmic ray characteristics are made using the data of global neutron monitor network and unique methods maintained at IZMIRAN: the Global Survey Method and the Ring of Stations Method. It is determined that the magnitude of Forbush effect under study was 15.7% (for particles with 10 GV rigidity) and as an extreme geomagnetic storm was recorded there was a significant magnetospheric effect observed in the data of neutron monitors (~4%).</description>

      <title>Mass supply from Io to Jupiter's magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the Voyager mission flybys in 1979, we have known the moon Io to be both volcanically active and the main source of plasma in the vast magnetosphere of Jupiter. Material lost from Io forms neutral clouds, the Io plasma torus and ultimately the extended plasma sheet. This material is supplied from Io's upper atmosphere and atmospheric loss is likely driven by plasma-interaction effects with possible contributions from thermal escape and photochemistry-driven escape. Direct volcanic escape is negligible. The supply of material to maintain the plasma torus has been estimated from various methods at roughly one ton per second. Most of the time the magnetospheric plasma environment of Io is stable on timescales from days to months. Similarly, Io's atmosphere was found to have a stable average density on the dayside, although it exhibits lateral and temporal variations. There is potential positive feedback in the Io torus supply: collisions of torus plasma with atmospheric neutrals are probably a significant loss process, which increases with torus density. The stability of the torus environment may be maintained by limiting mechanisms of either torus supply from Io or the loss from the torus by centrifugal interchange in the middle magnetosphere. Various observations suggest that occasionally the plasma torus undergoes major transient changes over a period of several weeks, apparently overcoming possible stabilizing mechanisms. Such events are commonly explained by some kind of change in volcanic activity that triggers a chain of reactions which modify the plasma torus state via a net change in supply of new mass. However, it remains unknown what kind of volcanic event (if any) can trigger events in torus and magnetosphere, whether Io's atmosphere undergoes a general change before or during such events, and what processes could enable such a change in the otherwise stable torus.</description>

      <title>Geodynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many super-Earths are on very short orbits around their host star and, therefore, more likely to be tidally locked. Because this locking can lead to a strong contrast between the dayside and nightside surface temperatures, these super-Earths could exhibit mantle convection patterns and tectonics that could differ significantly from those observed in the present-day solar system. The presence of an atmosphere, however, would allow transport of heat from the dayside towards the nightside and thereby reduce the surface temperature contrast between the two hemispheres. On rocky planets, atmospheric and geodynamic regimes are closely linked, which directly connects the question of atmospheric thickness to the potential interior dynamics of the planet. Here, we study the interior dynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b ($R=1.34$ $R_{\oplus}$, $M=3.0$ $M_{\oplus}$, T$_\mathrm{eq}\approx700$ K), which is one of the most suitable M-dwarf super-Earth candidates for retaining an atmosphere produced by degassing from the mantle and magma ocean. We investigate how the geodynamic regime of GJ 486b is influenced by different surface temperature contrasts by varying possible atmospheric circulation regimes. We also investigate how the strength of the lithosphere affects the convection pattern. We find that hemispheric tectonics, the surface expression of degree-1 convection with downwellings forming on one hemisphere and upwelling material rising on the opposite hemisphere, is a consequence of the strong lithosphere rather than surface temperature contrast. Anchored hemispheric tectonics, where downwellings und upwellings have a preferred (day/night) hemisphere, is favoured for strong temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside and higher surface temperatures.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiters are asynchronous rotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are typically assumed to be synchronously rotating, from tidal locking. Their thermally-driven atmospheric winds experience Lorentz drag on the planetary magnetic field anchored at depth. We find that the magnetic torque does not integrate to zero over the entire atmosphere. The resulting angular momentum feedback on the bulk interior can thus drive the planet away from synchronous rotation. Using a toy tidal-ohmic model and atmospheric GCM outputs for HD189733b, HD209458b and Kepler7b, we establish that off-synchronous rotation can be substantial at tidal-ohmic equilibrium for sufficiently hot and/or magnetized hot Jupiters. Potential consequences of asynchronous rotation for hot Jupiter phenomenology motivate follow-up work on the tidal-ohmic scenario with approaches that go beyond our toy model.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Properties of Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of solar-stellar activity on planetary environments is a topic of great interest within the Sun-Earth system as well as exoplanetary systems. In particular, extreme events such as flares and coronal mass ejections have a profound effect on planetary atmospheres. In May this year, a magnetic active region on the Sun (AR 13664) -- with a size exceeding hundred times that of Earth -- unleashed a large number of high energy X-class flares and associated mass ejections. The resulting Earth impact (geomagnetic storm) on May 10-11 was the strongest in the last two decades. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of the magnetic properties of the active region that spawned these flares and identify this to be a super active region with very rare physical characteristics. We also demonstrate how the rate of energization of the system is related to the flaring process. Our work illuminates how flare productive super active regions on the Sun and stars can be identified and what are their salient physical properties. Specifically, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May-2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at 99.95 percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May-2024 June, and at 99.10 percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April-2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank highest among all ARs recorded in SHARP data series during 2010 May-2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares it spawned were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be solar super active region and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.</description>
