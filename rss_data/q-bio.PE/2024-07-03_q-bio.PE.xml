      <title>A refractory density approach to a multi-scale SEIRS epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-scale modeling framework for infectious disease spreading, borrowing ideas and modeling tools from the so-called Refractory Density (RD) approach. We introduce a microscopic model that describes the probability of infection for a single individual and the evolution of the disease within their body. From the individual-level description, we then present the corresponding population-level model of epidemic spreading on the mesoscopic and macroscopic scale. We conclude with numerical illustrations taking into account either a white Gaussian noise or an escape noise to showcase the potential of our approach in producing both transient and asymptotic complex dynamics as well as finite-size fluctuations consistently across multiple scales. A comparison with the epidemiology of coronaviruses is also given to corroborate the qualitative relevance of our new approach.</description>

      <title>Solving the prisoner's dilemma trap in Hamilton's model of temporarily formed random groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the evolution of cooperation in the strong altruism scenario, where a cooperator does not benefit from her contribution to the public goods, is a challenging problem that requires positive assortment among cooperators (i.e., cooperators must tend to associate with other cooperators) or punishment of defectors. The need for these drastic measures stems from the analysis of a group selection model of temporarily formed random groups introduced by Hamilton nearly fifty years ago to describe the fate of altruistic behavior in a population. Challenging conventional wisdom, we show analytically here that strong altruism evolves in Hamilton's original model in the case of biparental sexual reproduction. Moreover, when the cost of cooperation is small and the amplified contribution shared by group members is large, cooperation is the only stable strategy in equilibrium. Thus, our results provide a solution to the `problem of origination' of strong altruism, i.e. how cooperation can take off from an initial low frequency of cooperators. We discuss a possible reassessment of cooperation in cases of viral co-infection, as cooperation may even be favored in situations where the prisoner's dilemma applies.</description>

      <title>The Accumulation of Beneficial Mutations and Convergence to a Poisson Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of a population with fixed size $N$, which is subjected to an unlimited supply of beneficial mutations at a constant rate $\mu_N$. Individuals with $k$ beneficial mutations have the fitness $(1+s_N)^k$. Each individual dies at rate 1 and is replaced by a random individual chosen with probability proportional to its fitness. We show that when $\mu_N \ll 1/(N \log N)$ and $N^{-\eta} \ll s_N \ll 1$ for some $\eta &lt; 1$, large numbers of beneficial mutations are present in the population at the same time, competing against each other, yet the fixation times of beneficial mutations, after a time scaling, converge to the times of a Poisson process.</description>
