      <title>Inferring Thunderstorm Occurrence from Vertical Profiles of Convection-Permitting Simulations: Physical Insights from a Physical Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thunderstorms have significant social and economic impacts due to heavy precipitation, hail, lightning, and strong winds, necessitating reliable forecasts. Thunderstorm forecasts based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) often rely on single-level surrogate predictors, like convective available potential energy and convective inhibition, derived from vertical profiles of three-dimensional atmospheric variables. In this study, we develop SALAMA 1D, a deep neural network which directly infers the probability of thunderstorm occurrence from vertical profiles of ten atmospheric variables, bypassing single-level predictors. By training the model on convection-permitting NWP forecasts, we allow SALAMA 1D to flexibly identify convective patterns, with the goal of enhancing forecast accuracy. The model's architecture is physically motivated: sparse connections encourage interactions at similar height levels while keeping model size and inference times computationally efficient, whereas a shuffling mechanism prevents the model from learning non-physical patterns tied to the vertical grid. SALAMA 1D is trained over Central Europe with lightning observations as the ground truth. Comparative analysis against a baseline machine learning model that uses single-level predictors shows SALAMA 1D's superior skill across various metrics and lead times of up to at least 11 hours. Moreover, expanding the archive of forecasts from which training examples are sampled improves skill, even when training set size remains constant. Finally, a sensitivity analysis using saliency maps indicates that our model relies on physically interpretable patterns consistent with established theoretical understanding, such as ice particle content near the tropopause, cloud cover, conditional instability, and low-level moisture.</description>

      <title>Predicting Coastal Water Levels in the Context of Climate Change Using Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Time Series Analysis Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given recent increases in ocean water levels brought on by climate change, this investigation decomposed changes in coastal water levels into its fundamental components to predict maximum water levels for a given coastal location. The study focused on Virginia Key, Florida, in the United States, located near the coast of Miami. Hourly mean lower low water (MLLW) levels were obtained from the National Data Buoy Center from January 28, 1994, through December 31, 2023. In the temporal dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filters were used to extract long-term trends, annual and daily tides, and higher frequency harmonics, while in the spectral dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing were used to confirm known tidal frequencies and periods. A linear model predicted that the long-term trend in water level will rise 2.02 feet from January 1994 to December 2050, while a quadratic model predicted a rise of 5.91 during the same period. In addition, the combined crests of annual tides, daily tides, and higher frequency harmonics increase water levels up to 2.16 feet, yielding a combined total of 4.18 feet as a lower bound and a combined total of 8.09 feet as an upper bound. These findings provide a foundation for more accurate prediction of coastal flooding during severe weather events and provide an impetus for policy choices with respect to residential communities, businesses, and wildlife habitats. Further, using Kolmogorov-Zurbenko analytic methods to study coastal sites throughout the world could draw a more comprehensive picture of the impact climate change is having on coastal waters globally.</description>

      <title>Spatial variation of future trends in Atlantic upwelling cells from two CMIP6 models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are characterized by wind-triggered upwelling of deep waters along the coast. They are hotspots of biological productivity and diversity and therefore have a high economic, ecological and social importance. In the past, different methods using surface data have been used to estimate upwelling. Recently, the IPCC has suggested directly assessing vertical velocities as a promising method. We use this method to study the two Atlantic EBUS from CMIP6 models from the HadGEM3-GC3.1 and the CNRM6-CM6 family, for both the historical period and a high-emission future scenario with spatial resolutions in the ocean component ranging from 1{\deg}to 1/12{\deg}. The two major upwelling regions are divided in subregions depending on their seasonality. The vertical transport index shows similar values to a wind-derived Ekman index. Directly evaluating upwelling from transport processes further provides information about the depth of the upwelling, which has previously been identified as an important factor for nutrient availability. We show that depending on the subregion of the upwelling system, different cell structures can be seen in terms of depth and distance to the coast of maximum velocities. When looking at possible future changes, high interannual variability limits the significance of the trends but could indicate a poleward shift of the upwelling regions.A detailed comparison of the spatial structures and the distinction in subregions is important to explain contradictory trends in previous works.</description>

      <title>Generating ensembles of spatially-coherent in-situ forecasts using flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based methodology for in-situ weather forecast postprocessing that is both spatially coherent and multivariate. Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</description>

      <title>Efficient fine-tuning of 37-level GraphCast with the Canadian global deterministic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work describes a process for efficiently fine-tuning the GraphCast data-driven forecast model to simulate another analysis system, here the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Using two years of training data (July 2019 -- December 2021) and 37 GPU-days of computation to tune the 37-level, quarter-degree version of GraphCast, the resulting model significantly outperforms both the unmodified GraphCast and operational forecast, showing significant forecast skill in the troposphere over lead times from 1 to 10 days. This fine-tuning is accomplished through abbreviating DeepMind's original training curriculum for GraphCast, relying on a shorter single-step forecast stage to accomplish the bulk of the adaptation work and consolidating the autoregressive stages into separate 12hr, 1d, 2d, and 3d stages with larger learning rates. Additionally, training over 3d forecasts is split into two sub-steps to conserve host memory while maintaining a strong correlation with training over the full period.</description>

      <title>Representing and Analysing Conceptual Understanding of Cloud Physics Using Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of conceptual understanding in cloud physics among 138 learners, ranging from bachelor's students to disciplinary experts and representing diverse academic backgrounds. To do so, we apply the mathematical framework of network analysis. Using a quasi-longitudinal study, we highlight the main changes in metrics associated with knowledge structures and understanding in cloud physics, and with the representation of the discipline and its inherent conceptual complexities. Overall, our results both qualify and quantify the epistemological shift in the description of the life-cycle of a cloud (from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed description of cloud microphysical processes) as learners mature in their understanding of the discipline. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts complements and confirms our findings. These can be used by lecturers to tailor their teaching towards the identified expert-like concepts, and by students to anticipate the main complexities in the field during their learning process.</description>

      <title>Improving Significant Wave Height Prediction Using Chronos Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate wave height prediction is critical for maritime safety and coastal resilience, yet conventional physics-based models and traditional machine learning methods face challenges in computational efficiency and nonlinear dynamics modeling. This study introduces Chronos, the first implementation of a large language model (LLM)-powered temporal architecture (Chronos) optimized for wave forecasting. Through advanced temporal pattern recognition applied to historical wave data from three strategically chosen marine zones in the Northwest Pacific basin, our framework achieves multimodal improvements: (1) 14.3% reduction in training time with 2.5x faster inference speed compared to PatchTST baselines, achieving 0.575 mean absolute scaled error (MASE) units; (2) superior short-term forecasting (1-24h) across comprehensive metrics; (3) sustained predictive leadership in extended-range forecasts (1-120h); and (4) demonstrated zero-shot capability maintaining median performance (rank 4/12) against specialized operational models. This LLM-enhanced temporal modeling paradigm establishes a new standard in wave prediction, offering both computationally efficient solutions and a transferable framework for complex geophysical systems modeling.</description>
