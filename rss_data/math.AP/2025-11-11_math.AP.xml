      <title>Molecular Seeds of Shear: An operator-level necessity result for first-order Chapman-Enskog deviatoric stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit functional-analytic formulation and rigorous derivation showing that, in closed and unforced kinetic systems under Chapman-Enskog scaling, anisotropic (deviatoric) stress appears only when the first Chapman-Enskog kinetic correction $f^{(1)}$ is nonzero. Under precise nullspace, coercivity, and Fredholm solvability assumptions on the linearized collision operator, and with uniform remainder control, we prove that a vanishing first correction implies the absence of $O(\varepsilon)$ deviatoric stress in the hydrodynamic limit. A fully worked BGK example and remainder estimates are included. We discuss implications for how microscopic seeds (deterministic departures or finite-$N$ fluctuations) project into macroscopic amplification channels for transition and turbulence. The result is proved under explicit nullspace, coercivity (or hypocoercivity) and Fredholm solvability hypotheses for the linearized collision operator, together with uniform remainder bounds; these assumptions are stated precisely in Section 4 and Appendix A and restrict the class of admissible interaction kernels to those listed in A1.</description>

      <title>On semilinear damped wave equations with initial data in homogeneous sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study semilinear damped equations $u_{tt}+u_t-\Delta u=|u|^p$ with the initial data in $({\dot{H}^{-\gamma}}\cap H^s)\times({\dot{H}^{-\gamma}}\cap L^2)$. Chen-Reissig \cite{chenreissig2023} studied the case $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\frac{n}{2}$ and showed that the exponent $p_{\mathrm{crit}}=1+\frac{4}{n+2\gamma}$ of $p$ distinguishes the time global existence and the blow-up of solution. In this paper, we discuss the case $\gamma\ge\frac{n}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Electron beams: partially flat solutions of a nonlinear elliptic equation with a singular absorption term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the so-called Child-Langmuir law, established since 1911, an electron beam is formed linking two electrodes, which are assumed to be two parallel plates of area $A$, separated to a finite distance $D.$ When $% D\ll \sqrt{A},$ \textquotedblleft edge effects\textquotedblright\ are negligible and the modelling is reduced to a nonlinear boundary problem for a singular ordinary differential equation\ in which a constant coefficient (the generated electric current $j$) must be found in order to get simultaneously Dirichlet and Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions in one of the extremes. If $D&gt;\sqrt{A},$ then the problem becomes much more difficult since the \textquotedblleft edge effects\textquotedblright\ arise in the plane $(x,y)$ and the electric current (now $j(x)$ due to the presence of a very large perpendicular magnetic field) must be determined in order to get solutions $u(x,y)$ of a singular semilinear equation which are partially flat ($u=\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0$ on a part of the boundary). In this paper, we offer a rigorous mathematical treatment of some former studies (Joel Lebowitz and Alexander Rokhenko (2003) and Alexander Rokhenko (2006)), where several open questions were left open: for instance, the need for a singularity of $j(x)$ near the cathode edge to get such partially flat solutions.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotically linear problem for an elliptic equation with an indefinite nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semilinear elliptic problem \[ -\Delta u = Q_{\Omega} |u|^{p-2}u \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N, \] where \( Q_{\Omega} = \chi_{\Omega} - \chi_{\mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega} \) for a bounded smooth domain \( \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N \), \( N \ge 3 \), and \( 1 &lt; p &lt; 2^{*} \). This equation arises in the study of optical waveguides and exhibits indefinite nonlinearity due to the sign-changing weight \( Q_{\Omega} \). We prove that, for \( p &gt; 2 \) sufficiently close to \( 2 \), the problem admits a unique positive solution, which is nondegenerate. Our approach combines a detailed analysis of an associated eigenvalue problem involving \( Q_{\Omega} \) with variational methods and blow-up techniques in the asymptotically linear regime. We also provide a comprehensive study of the spectral properties of the corresponding linear problem, including the existence and qualitative behavior of eigenfunctions, sharp decay estimates, and symmetry results. In particular, we establish analogues of the Faber--Krahn and Hong--Krahn--Szeg{\"o} inequalities in this non-standard setting.</description>

      <title>Gradient regularity for strongly singular or degenerate elliptic and parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent advances in the regularity theory for weak solutions to some classes of elliptic and parabolic equations with strongly singular or degenerate structure. The equations under consideration satisfy standard $p$-growth and $p$-ellipticity conditions only outside a ball centered at the origin. In the elliptic setting, we describe Besov and Sobolev regularity results for suitable nonlinear functions of the gradient of the weak solutions, covering both the subquadratic ($1&lt;p&lt;2$) and superquadratic ($p\geq2$) regimes. Analogous results are obtained in the corresponding parabolic framework, where we address the higher spatial and temporal differentiability of the solutions under appropriate assumptions on the data.</description>

      <title>Factorization method for the biharmonic scattering problem for an absorbing penetrable obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the factorization method to the inverse scattering problem of reconstructing the shape and location of an absorbing penetrable obstacle embedded in a thin infinite elastic (Kirchhoff--Love) plate. With the assumption that the plate thickness is small compared to the wavelength of the incident wave, the propagation of flexural perturbations is modeled by the two--dimensional biharmonic wave equation in the frequency domain. Within this setting, we provide a rigorous justification of the factorization method and demonstrate that it yields a binary criterion for distinguishing whether a sampling point lies inside or outside the scattering obstacle, using only the spectral data of the far--field operator. In addition, we numerically analyze the Born approximation for weak scatterers in this biharmonic scattering context and compute the relative error against exact far--field data for sample weak scatterers, thereby quantifying its validity as a limited but useful approximation.</description>

      <title>Plankton-Oxygen Dynamics in the Context of Climate Change: A Fractional Model with A Probability Density Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how climate change affects marine oxygen production by modeling plankton--oxygen dynamics with a fractional-order nonlinear system and establishing rigorous conditions for the model's well-posedness. We formulate a three-dimensional system $d^\alpha x(t)/dt^\alpha = A x(t) + f(x(t))$, where $A$ is a diagonal $3\times 3$ matrix and $f$ is nonlinear. We (i) rigorously state the model, (ii) derive a Lipschitz constant for $f$ under suitable assumptions, and (iii) prove existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data using a fractional formula with a probability density kernel and a generalized Gr"onwall inequality. Under the stated conditions, $f$ satisfies a computable Lipschitz bound that yields existence and uniqueness of solutions for the fractional system, and the solutions depend continuously on initial conditions, establishing the well-posedness of the plankton--oxygen model. We introduce a fractional, PDF-kernel--based framework for plankton--oxygen dynamics and provide general proofs of well-posedness via a generalized Gr"onwall approach, capturing memory effects that classical integer-order models miss. These results justify numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses of fractional marine-ecosystem models, providing a sound basis for testing mitigation and management strategies affecting oxygen dynamics and supporting evidence-based policies for protecting marine ecosystems under global warming.</description>

      <title>Stability of variable-coefficient parabolic equations in non-cylindrical domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stability of parabolic equations with space-time-dependent coefficients in non-cylindrical domains. We establish $L^\infty$- and $L^2$-norm estimates for solutions of the system. Based on these estimates, we investigate the stability of solutions for specific boundary curves. Unlike in cylindrical domains, the energy of solutions to such equations may not exhibit exponential decay. The techniques used in the proof rely on the weighted multiplier method and the comparison principle.</description>

      <title>On the exchange of stability for the subcritical laminar flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider steady water waves in two-dimensional channel bounded below by a flat, rigid bottom and above by a free surface. The surface tension is neglected and the water motion is rotational with a constant vorticity $a$. We consider an analytic branch of Stokes waves started from a subcritical laminar flow, where the period is considered as the bifurcation parameter. The first eigenvalue of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative on this branch is always negative. The main object of our study is the second eigenvalue of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative at this branch in a neighborhood of the laminar flow. This is a small eigenvalue and the positive sign corresponds to the confirmation of the principle of exchange of stability and the negative sign to its violation. We consider the dependence of the sign on the Bernoulli constant $R$ (or the depth $d$ of the laminar flow) and the value of the constant vorticity $a$. We show that for each $a$ there exist a depth $d_0(a)$ such that the sign of the second eigenvalue is positive for $d&lt;d_0(a)$ and negative for $d&gt;d_0(a)$. If $d_s(a)$ is the depth where a stagnation point appears on the corresponding laminar flow then $d_0(a)&lt;d_s(a)$ for positive $a$ and $d_0(a)&gt;d_s(a)$ for negative $a&lt;-1.01803$. The sign of the second eigenvalue is important in study of subharmonic bifurcations. Another observed property consists of the following: if the sign of the second eigenvalue is positive then the period is increasing along the bifurcation curve in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point, if the sign is negative then the period is decreasing there. We also verify the property of formal stability by a description of the domain in $(a,d)$ variables, where this property holds. Numerical illustrations of these properties are presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Co-rotating nearly parallel helical vortices with small cross-section in 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider clustered solutions to a semilinear elliptic equation in divergence form \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\varepsilon^2\text{div}(K(x)\nabla u)= (u-q|\ln\varepsilon|)^{p}_+,\ \ &amp;x\in \Omega,\\ u=0,\ \ &amp;x\in\partial \Omega \end{cases} \end{equation*} for small values of $ \varepsilon $. Using Green's function of the elliptic operator $ -\text{div}(K(x)\nabla) $ and finite-dimensional reduction method, we prove that there exist clustered solutions with cluster point $ 0 $ and cluster distance $ |\ln\varepsilon| ^{-\frac{1}{2}} $ whose small-structure is governed by some functional $ H_N $ determined by $ K $ and $ q $. As an application, we prove the existence of traveling-rotating helical vorticity fields to 3D incompressible Euler equations in infinite cylinders, whose support sets consist of helical tubes with small cross-section of radius $ \varepsilon $ and arbitrary circulation $ \kappa $ and concentrates near ``$ 2N $'' and ``$ 2N+1 $'' type of co-rotating helical solutions of nearly parallel vortex filaments model as $ \varepsilon\to0 $, which justifies the result in Klein, Majda and Damodaran [1995, JFM] and generalizes results in Guerra and Musso [arxiv: 2502.01470]. Several kinds of solutions such as ``2 asymmetric'', ``$ 2\times2 $ asymmetric'' and ``$ 2\times2+1 $ asymmetric'' type of co-rotating helical filaments are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem associated with the Kawahara equation on a general metric star graph. Initially, we identify suitable boundary conditions that produce a well-behaved dynamics for the linear equation. Subsequently, we derive the integral formula using the forcing operator method, previously applied to the Kawahara equation on the half-line by Cavalcante and Kwak (GAFA 1993), and the Fourier restriction method of Bourgain (NoDEA 2020). This work has the potential to be extended to other fifth-order nonlinear dispersive equations on star graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-Radial Solution Structures for Quasilinear Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman Equations in Bounded Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasilinear Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations on bounded smooth convex domains. We show that the quasilinear Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations arise naturally from stochastic optimal control problems with exit-time costs. The PDE is obtained via dynamic programming applied to controlled It\^{o} diffusions, providing both a probabilistic interpretation and a rigorous derivation. Our result establishes existence and uniqueness of positive classical solutions under sub-quadratic growth conditions on the source term. The constructive proofs, based on monotone iteration and barrier techniques, also provide a framework for algorithmic implementation with applications in production planning and image restoration. We provide complete detailed proofs with rigorous estimates and establish the connection to stochastic control theory through the dynamic programming principle.</description>

      <title>The emergence of nonlinear Jeans-type instabilities for quasilinear wave equations. II: Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the previous work by the first author [arXiv:2409.02516] and [Math. Ann. 393 (2025), 317-363], analyzing the long-term behavior of solutions to a broader class of quasilinear wave equations with parameter $1&lt;\mathsf{a}\leq30$ and $\frac{1}{3}\leq\mathsf{b}\leq\frac{2}{3}$: \begin{equation*}
  \partial^2_t \varrho- \biggl( \frac{ \mathsf{m}^2 (\partial_{t}\varrho )^2}{(1+\varrho )^2} + 4(\mathsf{k}-\mathsf{m}^2)(1+\varrho )\biggr) \Delta \varrho = F(t,\varrho,\partial_{\mu} \varrho) \end{equation*} where $F$ is given by \begin{equation*}
  F(t,\varrho,\partial_{\mu} \varrho):=
  \mathsf{b} \varrho (1+ \varrho ) -(\mathsf{a}-1) \partial_{t}\varrho

Abstract: We prove that any nonnegative viscosity solution of the inequality $$(-\Delta_p)^s u(x) \geq u^{t} |\nabla u|^{m}\quad \text{ in }\; \mathbb{R}^N,\; N\geq 2,$$ must be constant. This result holds for parameters $p\in (1, \infty), s\in (0, 1)$, $t, m\geq 0$, satisfying $$t (N-sp) + m(N-(sp-p+1)) &lt; N(p-1),$$ with the additional condition that either $m\leq p-1$ if $p-1&lt;sp$, or $m&lt;sp$ if $p-1\geq sp$.</description>

      <title>Critical threshold for a two-species chemotaxis system with the energy critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-species chemotaxis model in $\R^d(d \ge 3)$ featuring nonlinear porous medium-type diffusion and nonlocal attractive power-law interaction. Here, the nonlinear diffusion is chosen to be $1/m_1+1/m_2=(d+2)/d$ in such a way that the associated free energy is conformal invariant, and there are radially symmetric, non-increasing and non-compactly supported stationary solutions $(U_s(x),V_s(x))$. We analyze the conditions on initial data $(u_0,v_0)$ under which attractive forces dominate over diffusion, and further classify the global existence and finite time blow-up of dynamical solutions by virtue of these stationary solutions. Specifically, the solution $(u,v)(x,t)$ exists globally in time if the initial data satisfy $\|u_0\|_{L^{m_1}(\R^d)}&lt;\|U_s\|_{L^{m_1}(\R^d)}$ and $\|v_0\|_{L^{m_2}(\R^d)}&lt;\|V_s\|_{L^{m_2}(\R^d)}$. In contrast, there are blowing-up solutions when $\|u_0\|_{L^{m_1}(\R^d)}&gt;\|U_s\|_{L^{m_1}(\R^d)}$ and $\|v_0\|_{L^{m_2}(\R^d)}&gt;\|V_s\|_{L^{m_2}(\R^d)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the defocusing Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Using the G\'erard-type explicit formula, we prove the scattering result of solutions to this equation with initial data in $H_{+}^{1,\alpha}(\mathbb{R}) := \{u\in H_{+}^1(\mathbb{R}) : |x|^{\alpha}u\in L^2(\mathbb{R})\}$ for $\alpha&gt;1/4$. We also characterize the scattering using the distorted Fourier transform associated with the Lax operator. This is one of the first works that apply the G\'erard-type explicit formula to study the long-time behavior of an integrable equation for a broad class of initial data, beyond the previously studied rational cases.</description>

      <title>Improved equilibration rates to self-similarity for strong solutions of a thin-film and related evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of strong solutions to a family of nonlinear fourth-order evolution equations on the real line, with particular focus on the thin-film equation $\partial_tu = -(uu_{xxx})_x$. The method builds on the framework introduced by Carrillo and Toscani (Nonlinearity 27 (2014), 3159) for second-order nonlinear diffusion equations - by introducing a time-dependent rescaling that preserves the second moment, we establish sharp convergence rates toward the steady state in terms of the relative R\'enyi entropy. Compared to rates derived from the dissipation of the classical relative entropy, this approach yields improved estimates at early and intermediate times, and consequently a sharper convergence in the $L^1$-norm. The method is developed at a formal level for the family of fourth-order equations, including the well-known Derrida-Lebowitz-Speer-Spohn (DLSS) equation, but can be rigorously justified for strong solutions of the thin-film equation.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of a nonlocal kinetic model for dilute polymers with anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a class of nonlocal-in-time kinetic models of incompressible dilute polymeric fluids. The system couples a macroscopic balance of linear momentum equation with a mezoscopic subdiffusive Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of the probability density function of polymer configurations. The model incorporates nonlocal features to capture subdiffusive and memory-type phenomena. Our main result asserts the existence of global-in-time large-data weak solutions to this nonlocal system. The proof relies on an energy estimate involving a suitable relative entropy, which enables us to handle the critical general non-corotational drag term that couples the two equations. As a side result, we prove nonnegativity of the probability density function. A crucial step in our analysis is to establish strong convergence of the sequence of Galerkin approximations by a combination of techniques, involving a novel compactness result for nonlocal PDEs. Lastly, we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions with sufficient regularity.</description>

      <title>Global existence for the relativistic Vlasov-Poisson system in a two-dimensional bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global existence of solutions to the relativistic Vlasov-Poisson system for general initial data in convex bounded domains of two space dimensions, assuming the specular reflection boundary conditions for the distribution density. The boundary conditions for the electric potential are considered in two cases: Neumann boundary conditions and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The core ideas involve constructing suitable velocity lemmas and applying geometric techniques. In the two-dimensional case, it is crucial to select the arc length as the parameter of the curve and to further combine this with the Frenet-Serret formulas, enabling us to effectively describe the distribution density equation near the boundary and thus establishing a vital connection in the geometric representation.</description>

      <title>A Revisiting of the Pressure Elimination for a Fluid-Structure PDE Interaction and its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish, for the first time, a new technique for eliminating and recovering the pressure for a fluid-structure interaction model that is valid in general bounded Lipschitz domains, without additional geometric conditions such as convexity of angles. The specific fluid-structure interaction (FSI) that we consider is a well-known model of coupled Stokes flow with linear elasticity, which constitutes a coupled parabolic-hyperbolic system. The coupling between these two distinct PDE dynamics occurs across a boundary interface, with each of the components evolving on its own distinct geometry, with the boundaries concerned being Lipschitz. For simplicity, we consider the linear version of this FSI system with Stokes flow. Our new pressure elimination technique admits of an explicit $C_{0}$-semigroup generator representation $\mathcal{A} : D(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}$, where $\mathbf{H}$ is the associated energy space of fluid-structure initial data. This leads to an analytic proof for the first time of the well-posedness of the continuous PDE in such general geometries. We illustrate some automatic consequences of our results to other fields, such as numerical approximations where it provides FEM convergence estimates over polygonal domains.</description>

      <title>Stability of Solitary Capillary-Gravity Water Waves in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the conditional orbital stability of fully localized solitary waves for the three-dimensional capillary-gravity water wave problem in finite depth under strong surface tension. The waves, constructed via a non-variational Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction in [26], are not energy minimizers and thus require a direct stability analysis. We adapt the Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss framework within Mielke's approach to handle the mismatch between well-posedness and energy spaces. The proof relies on spectral analysis of the linearized dynamics and careful treatment of the Hamiltonian structure defined by the energy and momentum functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a modified scattering and sharp $L^\infty$ decay result for both the Hartree and Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky equations in dimensions $2$ and $3$ using the testing by wavepackets approach due to Ifrim and Tataru. We show that modified scattering and sharp pointwise decay occur for these equations at a regularity much lower than previous results due to Hayashi-Naumkin and Kato-Pusateri, and as a corollary also show that the results on power-type scattering-critical NLS due to Hayashi-Naumkin can be proven under minimal regularity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Segregated solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems with sublinear coupling terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of infinitely many nonnegative, segregated solutions for the sublinearly coupled Schr\"odinger system \[ \begin{cases} -\Delta u + K_1(x)u = \mu u^{p-1} + \beta u^{\sigma_1}v^{\sigma_2+1} \\ -\Delta v + K_2(x)v = \nu v^{p-1} + \beta u^{\sigma_1+1}v^{\sigma_2} \end{cases} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N \] where $N \geq 2$, $p \in (2,2^*)$, $2^* = 2N/(N-2)$ ($2^* = \infty$ if $N=2$), $K_j$ are radial potentials, $\mu, \nu &gt; 0$, $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and critically $\sigma_j \in (0,1)$. The sublinear coupling exponents $\sigma_j$ introduce fundamental challenges due to nonsmooth nonlinearities and singularities in standard reduction methods. To overcome this, we develop an enhanced Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction framework. By recasting the problem within a specially constructed metric space of local minimizers for an outer boundary value problem, we derive sharp a priori estimates enabling contraction mapping arguments. This approach circumvents the limitations of classical methods for sublinear couplings. We further uncover a novel "dead core" phenomenon: solutions $(u_\ell, v_\ell)$ exhibit non-strict positivity with topological segregation. Specially, for $N=2$ and large integers $\ell$, there exist radii $0 &lt; R_1 &lt; R_2$ such that $\text{supp } u_\ell \subset B_{R_2}(0)$, $\text{supp } v_\ell \subset \mathbb{R}^N \setminus B_{R_1}(0)$, and $u_\ell + v_\ell \to 0$ uniformly in $B_{R_2}(0) \setminus B_{R_1}(0)$ as $\ell \to \infty$. Our methodology provides a versatile framework for handling nonsmooth nonlinearities in reduction techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic limit of weak solutions to compressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Poisson equations with local alignment force in three-dimensional torus domain. Due to the absence of dissipation terms in particle equation, it is difficult to study this problem. Based on the relative entropy method, it is shown that the global weak solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Poisson equations converge to the smooth solutions of the limiting two-phase fluid model.We obtained that the distribution function $f^{\epsilon}$ converges to a Dirac distribution in velocity, the fluid density $\rho^{\epsilon}$ and velocity $u^{\epsilon}$ converge to $\rho$ and $u$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model for bulk-surface viscous fluid mixtures. This model consists of a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model in the bulk coupled to a surface Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard system on the boundary. In this paper, we address the global well-posedness of strong solutions in the two-dimensional setting, also covering the physically meaningful case of non-degenerate mobility functions. Lastly, we prove the uniqueness of the corresponding strong solutions and their continuous dependence on the initial data. Our approach hinges upon new well-posedness and regularity theory for a convective bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard equation with non-degenerate mobilities, as well as a bulk-surface Stokes equation with non-constant coefficients.</description>

Abstract: This work studies the following system of parabolic partial differential equations \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D\Delta u + \chi \nabla \cdot(u \nabla v) + ru(1-u) - u v, \quad &amp; x \in \Omega, ~t &gt; 0, \\
  \displaystyle \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \Delta v + a u -v+ f(x,t), \quad &amp; x \in \Omega, ~t &gt; 0, \end{cases} \end{equation*} modeling the negative chemotaxis interactions between a biological species and a lethal chemical substance that is supplied according to the known function $f(x,t)$. \\\\ It is shown that if $f$ converges to a spatially homogeneous function $\tilde{f}$ in a certain sense, then the solution $(u,v)$ satisfies $$ ||u-\tilde{u}||_{L^2(\Omega)} + ||v-\tilde{v}||_{L^2(\Omega)} \to 0 \quad \text{as } t \to \infty, $$ where $(\tilde{u},\tilde{v})$ is the solution to the associated ODE system \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle \frac{d \tilde{u}}{dt~} = r \tilde{u} (1 - \tilde{u}) - \tilde{u}\tilde{v}, \quad &amp; t&gt;0,\\
  \displaystyle \frac{d \tilde{v}}{dt~} = a\tilde{u} - \tilde{v} + \tilde{f},\quad &amp; t&gt;0. \end{cases} \end{equation*} Some final remarks are given for the case in which $\tilde{f}$ is a time periodic function, and under which hypotheses do $(\tilde{u},\tilde{v})$ inherit this periodicity.</description>

      <title>Profile of a Touch-Down solution to a nonlocal MEMS model with critical parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a mathematical model arising in the study of MEMS devices, described by the following parabolic equation on $[0,T)\times\Omega$: $$\partial_t v = \Delta v + \frac{\lambda}{(1-v)^2\left( 1 + \gamma \int_{\Omega} \frac{1}{1-v}\, dx \right)^{2}} ,
\qquad 0 \leq v \leq 1,$$ where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain and $\lambda, \gamma &gt; 0$. We construct a solution with a prescribed profile, which quenches in finite time $T$ at exactly one interior point $a \in \Omega$. Moreover, we are able to provide an asymptotic description of the quenching profile.
  We reformulate the problem as a blow-up problem to utilize the techniques employed in Merle, Zaag in 1997, Duong, Zaag in 2019 and Duong, Ghoul, Kavallaris, Zaag 2022. The proof proceeds through two principal steps: a reduction to a finite-dimensional dynamical system and a classical topological argument employing index theory. The main challenge lies in managing the nonlocal integral term, which generates an additional gradient term when the problem is transformed into the blow-up framework.</description>

In this paper we establish the existence of vortex solutions for a mixed boundary-value problem derived from the Abelian-Higgs model incorporating a neutral scalar field, a system recently investigated by Eto, Peterson et al. [7]. By synergistically combining the shooting method with the Schauder fixed-point theorem, we derive sharp analytical criteria that delineate the Abelian vortex phase from the non-Abelian one. We also rigorously establish the monotonicity, uniform boundedness, and precise asymptotic behavior of the vortex profile functions. Our results provide rigorous confirmation of numerical observations regarding the phase boundary between these distinct vortex types.</description>

      <title>On the Propagation of Regularity of Solutions to the KdV Equation on the positive Half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study special regularity properties of solutions to the initial-boundary value problem associated with the Korteweg-de Vries equations posed on the positive half-line. In particular, for initial data $u_0 \in H^{\frac{3}{4}^{+}}(\mathbb{R}^+)$ and boundary data $f\in H^{\frac32^+}(\R^+)$, where the restriction of $u_0$ to some subset of $(b,\infty)$ has an extra regularity for any $b&gt;0$, we prove that the regularity of solutions $u$ moves with infinite speed to its left as time evolves until a certain time $T^*$. The existence of a stopping time $T^{*}$ appears because of the effect of the boundary function $f$. Also, as a consequence of our proof, we prove a gain in the regularity of the trace derivatives of the solutions for the Korteweg-de Vries on the half-line.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of chemotaxis-consumption systems with oppositely acting nonlocal terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a chemotaxis system where cells move in response to a chemical signal within a confined habitat. The model includes external source terms that combine local and nonlocal growth with dampening effects. The main focus is on conditions under which solutions exist for all time and remain uniformly bounded, preventing cell aggregation.
  Two types of source terms are considered. In the first case, the structure of the source term ensures that the total cell mass remains controlled over time. In the second case, this mass control is not guaranteed, which can lead to different dynamic behaviors. The results extend previous studies that examined similar systems but with more specific source terms and slightly different chemical dynamics. This work highlights how variations in the reaction terms influence the long-term behavior of the system.</description>

      <title>A note on the fourth-order Schrodinger equation with spatially growing inhomogeneous source term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a non-linear biharmonic Sch\"odinger equation with an unbounded inhomogeneous term. The main goal is to develop a local theory but also a global theory for small data, in the energy space. Moreover, we develop a local theory in Sobolev spaces with lower regularity. The challenge is to deal with the inhomogeneous unbounded term, which broke down the space translation invariance. In order to handle the inhomogenous term, we use some Strauss type estimates, which require a spherically symmetric assumption.</description>

Abstract: We study the focusing $L^2$-critical and supercritical stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation subject to additive or multiplicative noise. We investigate global or long time behavior of solutions in $H^1$, which would correspond to global well-posedness in the deterministic case, with either deterministic or random initial data, and establish quantitative information about the well-posedness time, its probability and bounds on the solution in both cases. We then give criteria for finite time blow-up with positive probability for an $H^1$-valued initial data with positive energy in both cases.</description>

      <title>Properties of Solutions to the Full Fractional Heat Operator Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following indefinite fully fractional heat equation involving the master operator . Under certain assumptions of the indefinite nonlinearity and its weight, we prove that there is no positive bounded solution, which is based on the monotonicity of the solution along the first direction that is proved by employing the method of moving planes. Besides, if the weight satisfy other conditions, we come to different conclusions according to the behavior of the nonlinearity at infinity.
  To overcome the difficulties caused by the operator, we lead in some mathematics tools that, as we believe, will be useful in studying problems involving other fractional operators or nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the Gatenby-Gawlinski model with heterogeneous acid diffusion in one space dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a variant of the Gatenby-Gawlinski model for acid-mediated tumor invasion in the one-dimensional experimental setting, accounting for heterogeneous diffusion of the lactic acid across the surrounding healthy tissues. Numerical simulations are performed by employing finite volume schemes on staggered cartesian grids, together with explicit time discretization. The effectiveness of such approach is proven by reproducing biologically relevant results like the formation of propagating invasion fronts and the emergence of an interstitial gap between normal and cancerous cells, which is driven by the pH lowering strategy and depends significantly on the non-homogenous diffusion rates. By means of a comparison analysis, we infer that a homogenization phenomenon arises in the long run for appropriate values of the physical parameters, thus paving the way for complex applications to interface diffusion problems of invasive processes.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Reaction Epidemic Model with a Free Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates an SEIS PDE model with a free boundary, which captures the dynamics of epidemic transmission, including diseases like COVID-19. This parabolic PDE system is analyzed in a rotationally symmetric domain, and the existence and uniqueness of the local solution are established through the straightening lemma. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of the global solution are established under specific conditions on the diffusion coefficients. Then the model introduces the basic reproductive number, $R_0$, which provides sufficient conditions for determining whether the disease will vanish or spread. Notably, when $R_0&lt;1$, the disease-free equilibrium(DFE) is shown to be globally stable, and when $R_0&gt;1$, the DFE is unstable. Lastly, we investigate the convergence speed of solutions by applying nonlinear elliptic eigenvalue techniques to the associated parabolic PDE system.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study an inverse problem consisting in the identification of a space-time dependent source term in the Ginzburg-Landau equation from final-time observations. We adopt a weak-solution framework and analyze Tikhonov's functional, deriving an explicit gradient formula via an adjoint system and proving its Lipschitz continuity. We then establish existence and uniqueness results for quasi-solutions, and validate the theory with numerical experiments based on iterative methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the interior regularity of solutions to a degenerate normalized $p$-Laplace equation, where the degeneracy is governed by a modulus of continuity whose inverse satisfies a Dini continuity condition. We prove that under very general assumptions on the degeneracy law, solutions belong to the $C^1$ class. We argue by approximating the solutions by a sequence of hyperplanes, which allows us to prove the desired regularity.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness and Scattering for Stochastic generalized KdV Equations with additive noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the defocusing stochastic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations (sgKdV) driven by additive noise, with a focus on mass-critical and supercritical nonlinearities. For integers $k \geq 4$, we establish local well-posedness almost surely up to scaling critical regularity. We also prove global well-posedness and scattering in $L^{2}_{x}(\mathbb{R})$ for the mass-critical equation with small initial data; also in $H^{1}_{x}(\mathbb{R})$ for the mass supercritical equation. In particular, we prove oscillatory integral estimates associated with more general dispersion relations, which are of independent interest; and we make use of a special case of these estimates as a main ingredient for the necessary bounds on the tail of the stochastic convolution for sgKdV, which is crucial to conclude scattering results.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Gradient Shrinking Ricci Solitons with Bach-like Flatness and Related Variational Formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Bach tensor in four dimensions can be expressed as a linear combination of two independent, symmetric, divergence-free, quadratic in curvature tensors U and V. Several classification results for gradient-shrinking Ricci solitons have been obtained under the assumption that the Bach tensor vanishes. We define a Bach-like tensor to be any other linear combination of U and V. We prove that, except along the Bach line, the vanishing of a Bach-like tensor forces a four-dimensional complete gradient-shrinking Ricci soliton to be either Einstein or isometric to the Gaussian soliton. Finally, we show that Bach-like tensors arise as Euler-Lagrange equations of a two-parameter family of quadratic curvature functionals and compute the corresponding first and second variation formulas.</description>

      <title>A PDE Perspective on Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains. Despite their empirical success, the mathematical foundations of those models remain only partially understood, particularly regarding the stability and consistency of the underlying stochastic and partial differential equations governing their dynamics.
  In this work, we develop a rigorous partial differential equation (PDE) framework for score-based diffusion processes. Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\sqrt{t}$ as $t \to 0$.
  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity. Our findings also provide practical insights for designing diffusion models, including principled criteria for score-function construction, loss formulation, and stopping-time selection. Altogether, this framework provides a quantitative understanding of the trade-off between generative capacity and imitation fidelity, bridging rigorous analysis and model design within a unified mathematical perspective.</description>

      <title>The relative index theorem and a characterization of Fredholm operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the relative index theorem on non-compact manifolds to encompass a wide variety of hypoelliptic differential operators of arbitrary order, demonstrating that the change in index when changing a differential operator locally can be calculated locally. We also show that the notion of invertibility at infinity (and coercive at infinity) is not only sufficient condition for an operator to be Fredholm but also necessary, resulting in a general geometric characterization of Fredholmness. This characterization connects to a model for unbounded \(KK\)-theory which assumes the operator to be Fredholm instead of having (locally) compact resolvent, and thus provides a convenient tool for index theory on non-compact spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow equation approach is a robust framework applicable to a broad class of singular SPDEs, including those with fractional Laplacians, throughout the entire subcritical regime. Inspired by Wilson's renormalization group, this method studies the coarse-grained process, which captures the behaviour of solutions across spatial scales. The corresponding flow equation describes how the nonlinear terms in the effective dynamics evolve with the coarse-graining scale, playing a role analogous to the Polchinski equation in quantum field theory. The renormalization problem is then solved inductively by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the flow equation.</description>

This leads to new results regarding the symbol calculus of such operators and their Schatten-class properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.09941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of viscosity solutions for fractional semilinear elliptic PDEs on open balls with bounded exterior condition in dimension $d\geq 1$. Our approach relies on a tree-based probabilistic representation based on a (2s)-stable branching processes for all $s\in (0,1)$, and our existence results hold for sufficiently small exterior conditions and nonlinearity coefficients. In comparison with existing approaches, we consider a wide class of polynomial nonlinearities without imposing upper bounds on their maximal degree or number of terms. Numerical illustrations are provided in large dimensions.</description>

      <title>Solving the Scattering Problem for Open Wave-Guide Networks, III: Radiation Conditions and Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the analysis of the scattering problem for a network of open wave-guides started in [arXiv:2302.04353, arXiv:2310.05816]. In this part we present explicit, physically motivated radiation conditions that ensure uniqueness of the solution to the scattering problem. These conditions stem from a 2000 paper of A. Vasy on 3-body Schrodinger operators; we discuss closely related conditions from a 1994 paper of H. Isozaki. Vasy's paper also proves the existence of the limiting absorption resolvents, and that the limiting solutions satisfy the radiation conditions. The statements of these results require a calculus of pseudodifferential operators, called the 3-body scattering calculus, which is briefly introduced here. We show that the solutions to the model problem obtained in arXiv:2302.04353 satisfy these radiation conditions, which makes it possible to prove uniqueness, and therefore existence, for the system of Fredholm integral equations introduced in that paper.</description>

      <title>Uniform Convergence of Adversarially Robust Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in the effect of different types of adversarial perturbations in data classification problems. Many of these models incorporate the adversarial power, which is an important parameter with an associated trade-off between accuracy and robustness. This work considers a general framework for adversarially-perturbed classification problems, in a large data or population-level limit. In such a regime, we demonstrate that as adversarial strength goes to zero that optimal classifiers converge to the Bayes classifier in the Hausdorff distance. This significantly strengthens previous results, which generally focus on $L^1$-type convergence. The main argument relies upon direct geometric comparisons and is inspired by techniques from geometric measure theory.</description>

Abstract: We obtain asymptotically sharp identification of fractional Sobolev spaces $ W^{s}_{p,q}$, extension spaces $E^{s}_{p,q}$, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\dot{F}^s_{p,q}$. In particular we obtain for $W^{s}_{p,q}$ and $E^{s}_{p,q}$ a stability theory a la Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu as $s \to 1$, answering a question raised by Brazke--Schikorra--Yung. Part of the results are new even for $p=q$.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior of solution to a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic kinetics: Boundedness, persistence, stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behavior of positive solutions for the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis competition system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic source
  \begin{equation}
  \label{abstract-eq} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v^{\lambda}} \nabla v) +ru- \mu u^2, \quad &amp;x\in \Omega,\cr 0=\Delta v- \alpha v +\beta u,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega, \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases}\, \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N (N \ge 2)$ is a smooth bounded domain, the parameters $\chi,\, r, \, \mu, \, \alpha,\,\beta$ are positive constants and $\lambda \in (0,1).$
  In this article, for all suitably smooth initial data $u_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0 \not \equiv 0,$ it has been proven that:
  First, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_1^*(p,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is $L^p(\Omega)$-bounded with $p \ge 2.$ Next, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_2^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined classical solutions is globally bounded. Third, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_3^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is uniformly bounded above and below eventually by some positive constants that are independent of its initial function $u_0.$ Last, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_4^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\alpha,\beta,r,\Omega)$ such that any globally bounded classical solution to system (0.1) exponentially converges to the constant steady state $(\frac{r}{\mu},\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\frac{r}{\mu}).$</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to proving Allard-Michael-Simon-type $L^p$-Sobolev inequalities $(p&gt;1)$ with explicit constants in the setting of Euclidean minimal submanifolds of arbitrary codimension. Our results require separate discussions for the cases $p\geq 2$ and $1&lt;p&lt;2$, respectively. In particular, for $p\geq 2$, we obtain an asymptotically sharp and codimension-free Sobolev constant. Our argument is based on optimal mass transport theory on Euclidean submanifolds and also provides an alternative, unified proof of the recent isoperimetric inequalities of Brendle (J. Amer. Math. Soc., 2021) and Brendle and Eichmair (Notices Amer. Math. Soc., 2024).</description>

Abstract: We establish both Lipschitz and logarithmic stability estimates for an inverse flux problem and subsequently apply these results to an inverse boundary coefficient problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the stability inequalities derived for the inverse boundary coefficient problem can be utilized in solving an inverse corrosion problem. This involves determining the unknown corrosion coefficient on an inaccessible part of the boundary based on measurements taken on the accessible part of the boundary.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness and positivity of solutions to a class of delayed transport equations on a network. The material flow is delayed at the vertices and along the edges. The problem is reformulated as an abstract boundary delay equation, and well-posedness is proved by using the Staffans-Weiss theory. We also establish spectral theory for the associated delay operators and provide conditions for the positivity of the semigroup.</description>

Abstract: The green functions for the heat and Laplace equations with dynamical boundary conditions in a ball are studied. First, the green functions of the Laplace equation with a dynamical boundary condition are given, and the properties of related heat kernels are discussed. Then using these ingredients, two complementary approximations to the heat equation with a dynamical boundary condition in a ball are constructed, including an approximation of green function and an approximation of solution. Moreover, the green function of the heat equation with a dynamical boundary condition is implicitly presented by a series of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Second Order Schr\"odinger Wave Equations Near Static Black Holes and Strong Singularities of the Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a linear Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ with a strongly singular potential $V$ not bounded from below on a non-compact incomplete Riemannian manifold $M$. We assume that the negative part of potential $V_{-}$ is measurable, and it does not necessarily belong to either local Kato or Stummel classes, and we define new geometric conditions on the growth of $V_{-}$ in a special $\textit{range control neighborhood (RCN)}$ such that $H$ is semibounded from below on functions compactly supported in these neighborhoods. We define RCN by means of $\textit{an inner time metric}$ which estimates the minimal time for a classical particle to travel between any two points on $M$, and we assume that $M$ is complete w.r.t. this metric, i.e. the potential $V$ is classically complete on $M$. For the corresponding Cauchy problem of the wave equation $u_{tt} + Hu = 0$, we define locally a Lorentzian metric such that its light cone is formed along the minimizing curves with respect to the inner time metric, where both an energy inequality and uniqueness of solutions hold. Inversely, for well-known Lorentzian metrics of static black holes - Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and de Sitter metrics - we study the wave equations for the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators, and we show that the event horizons of these black holes belong to the RCNs of infinity w.r.t. the inner time metrics, and that all solutions of the mixed problems stay in these neighborhoods indefinitely long.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantitative unique continuation properties of solutions to second-order elliptic equations with lower-order terms. In particular, we establish quantitative forms of the strong unique continuation property for solutions to generalized Schr\"odinger equations of the form $- \text{div}(A \nabla u) + W \cdot \nabla u + V u = 0$, where we assume that $A$ is bounded, elliptic, symmetric, and Lipschitz continuous, while $W$ belongs to $L^\infty$ and $V$ belongs to $L^p$ for some $p \ge n$. We also study the global unique continuation properties of solutions to these equations, establishing results that are related to Landis' conjecture concerning the optimal rate of decay at infinity. Versions of the theorems in this article have been previously proved using Carleman estimates, but here we present novel proof techniques that rely on frequency functions.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for interpreting observations of solar inertial waves in an idealized setting. Under the assumption of purely toroidal linear waves on the sphere, the stream function of the flow satisfies a fourth-order scalar equation. We prove well-posedness of wave solutions under explicit conditions on differential rotation. Moreover, we study the inverse problem of simultaneously reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation parameters from either complete or partial surface data. We establish convergence guarantee of iterative regularization methods by verifying the tangential cone condition, and prove local unique identifiability of the unknown parameters. Numerical experiments with Nesterov-Landweber iteration confirm reconstruction robustness across different observation strategies and noise levels.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned about the inverse coefficient problems of variable-coefficient fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations with drift on connected closed Riemannian manifolds. We prove that the knowledge of the underlying equation of order $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$ on any non-empty open subset of the underlying manifold determines the Riemannian metric, the drift and the potential, simultaneously and uniquely, up to a gauge transformation, under the same geometric assumptions on the observation set as in \cite{feizmohammadi2024calderonproblemfractionalschrodinger}. The method of proof is based on that of \cite{feizmohammadi2024calderonproblemfractionalschrodinger} for fractional Schr\"{o}dinger operators, with the incorporation of the Runge approximation to recover the drift term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the three-dimensional axisymmetric compressible Navier-Stokes equations under slip boundary conditions in a cylindrical domain excluding the axis. For initial density allowed to vanish, we establish the global existence and large time asymptotic behavior of strong and weak solutions, provided the shear viscosity is a positive constant and the bulk one is a power function of density with the power bigger than four-thirds. It should be noted that these results are obtained without any restrictions on the size of initial data. The key idea is to derive a pointwise estimate of the effective viscous flux by exploiting the axisymmetry of the solutions, along with the conformal mapping and the pull back Green's function, and then to cancel out the singularity using the slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of linear parabolic equations with measurable coefficients in divergence form whose volumetric heat capacity coefficients are assumed to be in some Muckenhoupt class of weights. As such, the coefficients can be degenerate, singular, or both degenerate and singular. A class of weighted parabolic cylinders with a non-homogeneous quasi-distance function, and a class of weighted parabolic Sobolev spaces intrinsically suitable for the class of equations are introduced. Under some smallness assumptions on the mean oscillations of the coefficients, regularity estimates, existence, and uniqueness of weak solutions in the weighted Sobolev spaces are proved. To achieve the results, we apply the level-set method introduced by Caffarelli and Peral.

      <title>On the Gevrey regularity of the fifth-order Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-II equation: An improved approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve and extend the results obtained by Boukarou et al. \cite{boukarou1} on the Gevrey regularity of solutions to a fifth-order Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-II equation. We establish Gevrey regularity in the time variable for solutions in $2+1$ dimensions, providing a sharper result obtained through a new analytical approach. Assuming that the initial data are Gevrey regular of order $\sigma \geq 1$ in the spatial variables, we prove that the corresponding solution is Gevrey regular of order $5 \sigma$ in time. Moreover, we show that the function $u(x, y, t)$, viewed as a function of $t$, does not belong to $G^z$ for any $1 \leq z&lt;5 \sigma$. Our proof introduces a new analytical method that establishes a general principle for dispersive equations of the form $ \partial_t u = \pm\partial_x^\alpha u + P(u),$ where $\partial_x^\alpha $ is the highest spatial derivative and $P(u)$ a polynomial in spatial derivatives of total order at most $\alpha-1$, the solution cannot belong to the Gevrey class $G^z$ in time for any $z$ satisfying $1 \leq z&lt;\alpha \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Large torus limit of global dynamics of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model (DAM), i.e. the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative spatial white noise. For this model, global well-posedness on the periodic domain was established by Visciglia and the second author (2023), and global well-posedness on the full space was established by Debussche, Visciglia, and the authors (2024). We show that, under suitable initial conditions and suitable periodization procedure of the noise, the periodic global dynamics of the DAM converges in spaces of local domains to that of the DAM on the full space as the period goes to infinity. In Appendix, we also discuss the same problem for the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Limited-Range Multilinear Off-Diagonal Extrapolation and Weighted Transference Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilinear $L^p$ extrapolation results are established in a limited-range, multilinear, and off-diagonal setting for mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces over $\sigma$-finite measure spaces. Integrability exponents are allowed in the full range $(0,\infty]$. We detach the exponents for the weight classes completely from the exponents for the initial and target spaces for the extrapolation except for the basic consistency condition. This enables to cover the full range $(0,\infty]$ for all integrability exponents and provides new insights into the dependency of the extrapolated bounds on the weight characteristic. Certain endpoint results are new even for $\mathbb{R}^d$. Additionally, in the setting of compact abelian groups, a weighted transference principle is established.</description>

      <title>Two-way Coupling of Fluid--Structure Interaction for Elastic Magneto-Swimmers:A Finite Element ALE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial micro-swimmers actuated by external magnetic fields hold significant promise for targeted biomedical applications, including drug delivery and micro-robot-assisted therapy. However, their dynamics remain challenging to control due to the complex nonlinear coupling between magnetic actuation, elastic deformations, and fluid interactions in confined biological environments. Numerical modeling is therefore essential to better understand, predict, and optimize their behavior for practical applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive finite element framework based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian formulation to simulate deformable elastic micro-swimmers in confined fluid domains. The method employs a full-order model that resolves the complete fluid dynamics while simultaneously tracking swimmer deformation and global displacement on conforming meshes. Numerical experiments are performed with the open-source finite element library Feel++, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental data from the literature. The validation benchmarks in both two and three dimensions confirm the accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the proposed framework, representing a foundational step toward developing digital twins of magneto-swimmers for biomedical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study a multi-dimensional nonlocal active scalar equation of the form \begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t\rho+g\mathcal{R}_a\rho\cdot \nabla\rho= 0,~\rho(\cdot,0)=\rho_{0}, \end{eqnarray*} where the transform $\mathcal{R}_a$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} \mathcal{R}_af(x)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}{\pi^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}P.V.\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n}\Big(\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^{n+1}}-\frac{x-y}{(|x-y|^2+a^2)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}\Big)f(y)dy. \end{eqnarray*} This model can be viewed as a natural generalization of the well-known Kiselev-Sasarm equation, which was introduced in [13] as a one-dimensional model for the two-dimensional incompressible porous media equation. We show the local well-posedness for this multi-dimensional model as well as the gradient blow-up in finite time for a class of radial initial data.</description>

Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By a small bundle gerbe we mean a bundle gerbe in the sense of Murray defined on a smooth, finite-dimensional, fibre bundle over a manifold. We construct such gerbes over compact oriented aspherical 3-manifolds, as well as in higher dimensions, generalizing the construction of decomposable bundle gerbes in earlier work with Singer. For these small bundle gerbes there is a direct index map given in terms of either fibrewise pseudodifferential operators, or more conveniently fibrewise semiclassical smoothing operators, twisted by the simplicial line bundle. We prove the Atiyah-Singer type theorem that this realizes the push-forward into twisted K-theory. We also give an application via the index of projective families of Spin_c Dirac operators, to show the existence of obstructions to metrics with large positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper continues the analysis, started in [1] (Part I,arXiv:2302.04353), of the model open wave-guide problem defined by 2 semi-infinite, rectangular wave-guides meeting along a common perpendicular line. In Part I we reduce the solution of the physical problem to a transmission problem rephrased as a system of integral equations on the common perpendicular line. In this part we show that solutions of the integral equations introduced in Part I have asymptotic expansions, if the data allows it. Using these expansions we show that the solutions to the PDE found in each half space satisfy appropriate outgoing radiation conditions. In Part III we show that these conditions imply uniqueness of the solution to the PDE as well as uniqueness for our system of integral equations.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative cross-curvature in infinite dimensions: synthetic definition and spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for simulating wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core principles of large-eddy simulations (LES). In particular, we employ the filtering function, interpreted as a spatial averaging operator, together with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to construct a closed numerical scheme suitable for computing solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. This framework numerically overcomes the difficulties associated with the non-locally integrable three-dimensional kernel inherent in the random vortex method, enabling efficient computation of flow fields via the Monte Carlo method. Several numerical experiments are presented for both laminar and turbulent flows in wall-bounded domains, to thereby reveal the underlying flow mechanisms near the wall boundary. The experimental results and systematic comparisons with alternative numerical approaches consistently demonstrate that the proposed method is numerically stable, possesses low theoretical complexity, and achieves acceptable computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Compact embeddings of Bessel Potential Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces have gained renewed interest due to their robust structural properties and applications in fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces, derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, are closely related to the Riesz fractional gradient. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous and compact embeddings of Bessel potential spaces into Lebesgue spaces. This paper extends these findings by addressing the compactness of continuous embeddings from the perspective of abstract interpolation theory. We present three distinct proofs, leveraging compactness results, translation estimates, and the relationship between Gagliardo and Bessel spaces. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the functional analytic properties of Bessel potential spaces and their applications in fractional PDEs.</description>

      <title>On geometry of $Q^{(2k)}_g$-curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of current article is to study the geometry of $Q$-curvature. For simplicity, we start with a simple model: a complete and conformal metric $g=e^{2u}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming that the metric $g$ has non-negative $nth$-order $Q$-curvature and non-negative scalar curvature, we show that the Ricci curvature is non-negative. If we further assume that the isoperimetric ratio near the end is positive, we show that the growth rate of $kth$ elementary symmetric function $\sigma_k(g)$ of Ricci curvature over geodesic ball of radius $r$ is at most polynomial in $r$ with order $n-2k$ for all $1 \leq k \leq \frac{n-2}{2}$. Similarly, we are able to show that the same growth control holds for $2kth$-order $Q$-curvature. Finally, we show that for $k=1$ or $2$, the gap theorems for $Q^{(2k)}_g$ hold true.</description>

      <title>BRIDGES Lectures: Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BRIDGES meeting in gauge theory, extremal structures, and stability was held June 2024 at l'Institut d'\'Etudes Scientifiques de Carg\`ese in Corsica, organized by Daniele Faenzi, Eveline Legendre, Eric Loubeau, and Henrique S\'a Earp. The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but related lecture series by Oscar Garc\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent Manivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the lecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on "Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures". Some assistance in the preparation of these notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer school. See the Comments field for more information.
  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric flows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows of such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows, and consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci flow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of geometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and survey several different geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In particular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Laplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude with a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and Gianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit STE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.</description>

      <title>On Riemann wave superpositions obtained from the Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper contains an analysis of the conditions for the existence of elastic versus non-elastic wave superpositions governed by the Euler system in (1+1)-dimensions. A review of recently obtained results is presented including the introduction of the notion of quasi-rectifiability of vector fields and its application to both elastic and non-elastic wave superpositions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing vector fields associated with the waves admitted by the Euler system is isomorphic to an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra which is the semi-direct sum of an Abelian ideal and the three-dimensional real Lie algebra K+ or K-. The maximal module corresponding to the Euler system can be transformed by an angle preserving transformation to a real algebra isomorphic to the Lie algebras K+, K-. The algebras K+ and K- are quasirectifiable and describe the behavior of wave superpositions. Based on these facts, we are able to find a parametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows for the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system.</description>
