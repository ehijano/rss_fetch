      <title>Structural DID with ML: Theory, Simulation, and a Roadmap for Applied Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference in observational panel data has become a central concern in economics,policy analysis,and the broader social sciences.To address the core contradiction where traditional difference-in-differences (DID) struggles with high-dimensional confounding variables in observational panel data,while machine learning (ML) lacks causal structure interpretability,this paper proposes an innovative framework called S-DIDML that integrates structural identification with high-dimensional estimation.Building upon the structure of traditional DID methods,S-DIDML employs structured residual orthogonalization techniques (Neyman orthogonality+cross-fitting) to retain the group-time treatment effect (ATT) identification structure while resolving high-dimensional covariate interference issues.It designs a dynamic heterogeneity estimation module combining causal forests and semi-parametric models to capture spatiotemporal heterogeneity effects.The framework establishes a complete modular application process with standardized Stata implementation paths.The introduction of S-DIDML enriches methodological research on DID and DDML innovations, shifting causal inference from method stacking to architecture integration.This advancement enables social sciences to precisely identify policy-sensitive groups and optimize resource allocation.The framework provides replicable evaluation tools, decision optimization references,and methodological paradigms for complex intervention scenarios such as digital transformation policies and environmental regulations.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Models for Learning Flow Maps of Stochastic Dynamical Systems in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in bounded domains, presents significant computational challenges due to particle exit phenomena, which requires accurate modeling of interior stochastic dynamics and boundary interactions. Despite the success of machine learning-based methods in learning SDEs, existing learning methods are not applicable to SDEs in bounded domains because they cannot accurately capture the particle exit dynamics. We present a unified hybrid data-driven approach that combines a conditional diffusion model with an exit prediction neural network to capture both interior stochastic dynamics and boundary exit phenomena. Our ML model consists of two major components: a neural network that learns exit probabilities using binary cross-entropy loss with rigorous convergence guarantees, and a training-free diffusion model that generates state transitions for non-exiting particles using closed-form score functions. The two components are integrated through a probabilistic sampling algorithm that determines particle exit at each time step and generates appropriate state transitions. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three test cases: a one-dimensional simplified problem for theoretical verification, a two-dimensional advection-diffusion problem in a bounded domain, and a three-dimensional problem of interest to magnetically confined fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>PAC Off-Policy Prediction of Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits, aiming to quantify the performance of a target policy using data collected under a different and potentially unknown behavior policy. Recently, methods based on conformal prediction have been developed to construct reliable prediction intervals that guarantee marginal coverage in finite samples, making them particularly suited for safety-critical applications. To further achieve coverage conditional on a given offline data set, we propose a novel algorithm that constructs probably approximately correct prediction intervals. Our method builds upon a PAC-valid conformal prediction framework, and we strengthen its theoretical guarantees by establishing PAC-type bounds on coverage. We analyze both finite-sample and asymptotic properties of the proposed method, and compare its empirical performance with existing methods in simulations.</description>

      <title>Estimating Treatment Effects with Independent Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of causal inference has developed a variety of methods to accurately estimate treatment effects in the presence of nuisance. Meanwhile, the field of identifiability theory has developed methods like Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify latent sources and mixing weights from data. While these two research communities have developed largely independently, they aim to achieve similar goals: the accurate and sample-efficient estimation of model parameters. In the partially linear regression (PLR) setting, Mackey et al. (2018) recently found that estimation consistency can be improved with non-Gaussian treatment noise. Non-Gaussianity is also a crucial assumption for identifying latent factors in ICA. We provide the first theoretical and empirical insights into this connection, showing that ICA can be used for causal effect estimation in the PLR model. Surprisingly, we find that linear ICA can accurately estimate multiple treatment effects even in the presence of Gaussian confounders or nonlinear nuisance.</description>

      <title>Structural Effect and Spectral Enhancement of High-Dimensional Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) is a widely used tool for classification and dimensionality reduction, but its performance in high-dimensional scenarios is inconsistent. Existing theoretical analyses of RLDA often lack clear insight into how data structure affects classification performance. To address this issue, we derive a non-asymptotic approximation of the misclassification rate and thus analyze the structural effect and structural adjustment strategies of RLDA. Based on this, we propose the Spectral Enhanced Discriminant Analysis (SEDA) algorithm, which optimizes the data structure by adjusting the spiked eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix. By developing a new theoretical result on eigenvectors in random matrix theory, we derive an asymptotic approximation on the misclassification rate of SEDA. The bias correction algorithm and parameter selection strategy are then obtained. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that SEDA achieves higher classification accuracy and dimensionality reduction compared to existing LDA methods.</description>

      <title>ReDi: Rectified Discrete Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs, which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we rigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using Conditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce the Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces factorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically, ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge, providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis.

      <title>Bayesian implementation of Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for uncertainty quantification in causal effect estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust decision making involves making decisions in the presence of uncertainty and is often used in critical domains such as healthcare, supply chains, and finance. Causality plays a crucial role in decision-making as it predicts the change in an outcome (usually a key performance indicator) due to a treatment (also called an intervention). To facilitate robust decision making using causality, this paper proposes three Bayesian approaches of the popular Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) algorithm, a flexible semi-parametric double robust estimator, for a probabilistic quantification of uncertainty in causal effects with binary treatment, and binary and continuous outcomes. In the first two approaches, the three TMLE models (outcome, treatment, and fluctuation) are trained sequentially. Since Bayesian implementation of treatment and outcome yields probabilistic predictions, the first approach uses mean predictions, while the second approach uses both the mean and standard deviation of predictions for training the fluctuation model (targeting step). The third approach trains all three models simultaneously through a Bayesian network (called BN-TMLE in this paper). The proposed approaches were demonstrated for two examples with binary and continuous outcomes and validated against classical implementations. This paper also investigated the effect of data sizes and model misspecifications on causal effect estimation using the BN-TMLE approach. Results showed that the proposed BN-TMLE outperformed classical implementations in small data regimes and performed similarly in large data regimes.</description>

      <title>A Distributional View of High Dimensional Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This PhD thesis presents a distributional view of optimization in place of a worst-case perspective. We motivate this view with an investigation of the failure point of classical optimization. Subsequently we consider the optimization of a randomly drawn objective function. This is the setting of Bayesian Optimization. After a review of Bayesian optimization we outline how such a distributional view may explain predictable progress of optimization in high dimension. It further turns out that this distributional view provides insights into optimal step size control of gradient descent. To enable these results, we develop mathematical tools to deal with random input to random functions and a characterization of non-stationary isotropic covariance kernels. Finally, we outline how assumptions about the data, specifically exchangability, can lead to random objective functions in machine learning and analyze their landscape.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning of Gibbs states for many-body Hamiltonians with applications to Quantum Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms: Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT (NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a 30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have discussed cell complexes as ideal learning representations. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods suitable for learning on CW complexes. In this paper, we derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance between cell complex signal distributions in terms of a Hodge-Laplacian matrix. This leads to a structurally meaningful measure to compare CW complexes and define the optimal transportation map. In order to simultaneously include both feature and structure information, we extend the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to CW complexes. Finally, we introduce novel kernels over the space of probability measures on CW complexes based on the dual formulation of optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography (mfEIT) represents a promising biomedical imaging modality that enables the estimation of tissue conductivities across a range of frequencies. Addressing this challenge, we present a novel variational network, a model-based learning paradigm that strategically merges the advantages and interpretability of classical iterative reconstruction with the power of deep learning. This approach integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton (PRGN) framework. By unrolling the PRGN algorithm, where each iteration corresponds to a network layer, we leverage the physical insights of nonlinear model fitting alongside the GNN's capacity to capture inter-frequency correlations. Notably, the GNN architecture preserves the irregular triangular mesh structure used in the solution of the nonlinear forward model, enabling accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations.</description>

Abstract: Given a probability measure on the unit disk, we study the problem of deciding whether, for some threshold probability, this measure is supported near a real algebraic variety of given dimension and bounded degree. We call this "testing the variety hypothesis". We prove an upper bound on the so-called "sample complexity" of this problem and show how it can be reduced to a semialgebraic decision problem. This is done by studying in a quantitative way the Hausdorff geometry of the space of real algebraic varieties of a given dimension and degree.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped Control Limits for Score-Based Concept Drift Control Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring for changes in a predictive relationship represented by a fitted supervised learning model (aka concept drift detection) is a widespread problem, e.g., for retrospective analysis to determine whether the predictive relationship was stable over the training data, for prospective analysis to determine when it is time to update the predictive model, for quality control of processes whose behavior can be characterized by a predictive relationship, etc. A general and powerful Fisher score-based concept drift approach has recently been proposed, in which concept drift detection reduces to detecting changes in the mean of the model's score vector using a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA). To implement the approach, the initial data must be split into two subsets. The first subset serves as the training sample to which the model is fit, and the second subset serves as an out-of-sample test set from which the MEWMA control limit (CL) is determined. In this paper, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for computing the CL. Our bootstrap CL provides much more accurate control of false-alarm rate, especially when the sample size and/or false-alarm rate is small. It also allows the entire initial sample to be used for training, resulting in a more accurate fitted supervised learning model. We show that a standard nested bootstrap (inner loop accounting for future data variability and outer loop accounting for training sample variability) substantially underestimates variability and develop a 632-like correction that appropriately accounts for this. We demonstrate the advantages with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Partitioned Sparse Variational Gaussian Process for Fast, Distributed Spatial Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of Department of Energy supercomputers will be capable of exascale computation. For these machines, far more computation will be possible than that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely on post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical analyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning algorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting must be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is distributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable approach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model independently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is scalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect of constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between neighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea by allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial partitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to smoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our decentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly scalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in terms of memory). We demonstrate this Partitioned SVGP (PSVGP) approach for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and compare the results to the independent SVGP case.</description>

      <title>Randomization Can Reduce Both Bias and Variance: A Case Study in Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the often overlooked phenomenon, first noted in \cite{breiman2001random}, that random forests appear to reduce bias compared to bagging. Motivated by an interesting paper by \cite{mentch2020randomization}, where the authors explain the success of random forests in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings through regularization, we explore how random forests can capture patterns in the data that bagging ensembles fail to capture. We empirically demonstrate that in the presence of such patterns, random forests reduce bias along with variance and can increasingly outperform bagging ensembles when SNR is high. Our observations offer insights into the real-world success of random forests across a range of SNRs and enhance our understanding of the difference between random forests and bagging ensembles. Our investigations also yield practical insights into the importance of tuning $mtry$ in random forests.</description>

      <title>Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04607v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Spectral Algorithms under Covariate Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of spectral algorithms under covariate shift. In this setting, the marginal distributions of the input data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Within a non-parametric regression framework over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we analyze the convergence rates of spectral algorithms under covariate shift and show that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, when these density ratios are unbounded, the spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted spectral algorithm with normalized weights that incorporates density ratio information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this normalized weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates, but the rates will suffer from the saturation phenomenon. Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm with clipped weights can approach the optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The Joys of Categorical Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model. Its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool, though, has remained conceptually opaque: While Conformal Prediction Regions (CPRs) give an ordinal representation of uncertainty (larger regions typically indicate higher uncertainty), they lack the capability to cardinally quantify it (twice as large regions do not imply twice the uncertainty). We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its cardinal UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges (and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a CPR is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break the global coverage guarantee.</description>

      <title>Edge of Stochastic Stability: Revisiting the Edge of Stability for SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent findings by Cohen et al., 2021, demonstrate that when training neural networks with full-batch gradient descent with a step size of $\eta$, the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\max}$ of the full-batch Hessian consistently stabilizes at $\lambda_{\max} = 2/\eta$. These results have significant implications for convergence and generalization. This, however, is not the case of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), limiting the broader applicability of its consequences. We show that SGD trains in a different regime we term Edge of Stochastic Stability (EoSS). In this regime, what stabilizes at $2/\eta$ is *Batch Sharpness*: the expected directional curvature of mini-batch Hessians along their corresponding stochastic gradients. As a consequence $\lambda_{\max}$ -- which is generally smaller than Batch Sharpness -- is suppressed, aligning with the long-standing empirical observation that smaller batches and larger step sizes favor flatter minima. We further discuss implications for mathematical modeling of SGD trajectories.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid in Non-Stationary Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital advertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to first-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's private valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding strategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective, the learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other bidders, i.e., opponents) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing research often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks performance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this approach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate significantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild non-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark--representing the sum of the highest achievable rewards at each time step--offers a more suitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the dynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward functions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify the regularity of the sequence of opponents' highest bids, which serve as measures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of the dynamic regret for the class of sequences of opponents' highest bids that satisfy either of these regularity constraints. Our main technical tool is the Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD) framework with a novel optimism configuration, which is well-suited for achieving minimax-optimal dynamic regret rates in this context. We then use synthetic datasets to validate our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our methods outperform existing ones.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence and Rich Feature Learning in $L$-Layer Infinite-Width Neural Networks under $\mu$P Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite deep neural networks' powerful representation learning capabilities, theoretical understanding of how networks can simultaneously achieve meaningful feature learning and global convergence remains elusive. Existing approaches like the neural tangent kernel (NTK) are limited because features stay close to their initialization in this parametrization, leaving open questions about feature properties during substantial evolution. In this paper, we investigate the training dynamics of infinitely wide, $L$-layer neural networks using the tensor program (TP) framework. Specifically, we show that, when trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under the Maximal Update parametrization ($\mu$P) and mild conditions on the activation function, SGD enables these networks to learn linearly independent features that substantially deviate from their initial values. This rich feature space captures relevant data information and ensures that any convergent point of the training process is a global minimum. Our analysis leverages both the interactions among features across layers and the properties of Gaussian random variables, providing new insights into deep representation learning. We further validate our theoretical findings through experiments on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection and Junta Testing are Statistically Equivalent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$, the junta testing problem asks whether $f$ depends on only $k$ variables. If $f$ depends on only $k$ variables, the feature selection problem asks to find those variables. We prove that these two tasks are statistically equivalent. Specifically, we show that the ``brute-force'' algorithm, which checks for any set of $k$ variables consistent with the sample, is simultaneously sample-optimal for both problems, and the optimal sample size is \[ \Theta\left(\frac 1 \varepsilon \left( \sqrt{2^k \log {n \choose k}} + \log {n \choose k}\right)\right). \]</description>

      <title>Note on Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader in Combinatorial Semi-Bandit Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimality and complexity of Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in size-invariant combinatorial semi-bandit problems. Recently, Honda et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024) showed that FTPL achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) optimality in standard multi-armed bandit problems with Fr\'{e}chet-type distributions. However, the optimality of FTPL in combinatorial semi-bandit problems remains unclear. In this paper, we consider the regret bound of FTPL with geometric resampling (GR) in size-invariant semi-bandit setting, showing that FTPL respectively achieves $O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ regret with Fr\'{e}chet distributions, and the best possible regret bound of $O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ with Pareto distributions in adversarial setting. Furthermore, we extend the conditional geometric resampling (CGR) to size-invariant semi-bandit setting, which reduces the computational complexity from $O(d^2)$ of original GR to $O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$ without sacrificing the regret performance of FTPL.</description>

      <title>Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</description>

      <title>A DPI-PAC-Bayesian Framework for Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified Data Processing Inequality PAC-Bayesian framework -- abbreviated DPI-PAC-Bayesian -- for deriving generalization error bounds in the supervised learning setting. By embedding the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) into the change-of-measure technique, we obtain explicit bounds on the binary Kullback-Leibler generalization gap for both R\'enyi divergence and any $f$-divergence measured between a data-independent prior distribution and an algorithm-dependent posterior distribution. We present three bounds derived under our framework using R\'enyi, Hellinger \(p\) and Chi-Squared divergences. Additionally, our framework also demonstrates a close connection with other well-known bounds. When the prior distribution is chosen to be uniform, our bounds recover the classical Occam's Razor bound and, crucially, eliminate the extraneous \(\log(2\sqrt{n})/n\) slack present in the PAC-Bayes bound, thereby achieving tighter results. The framework thus bridges data-processing and PAC-Bayesian perspectives, providing a flexible, information-theoretic tool to construct generalization guarantees.</description>
