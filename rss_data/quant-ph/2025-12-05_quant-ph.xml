      <title>Dissipative Yao-Lee Spin-Orbital Model: Exact Solvability and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exactly solvable dissipative models provide an analytical tool for studying the relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems. In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Movable Logical Qubits for Lattice Surgery Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice surgery with two-dimensional quantum error correcting codes is among the leading schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, motivated by superconducting hardware architectures. In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qecc.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Number of Code Switching Operations in Fault-Tolerant Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers rely on Quantum Error-Correcting Codes (QECCs) to protect information from noise. However, no single error-correcting code supports a fully transversal and therefore fault-tolerant implementation of all gates required for universal quantum computation. Code switching addresses this limitation by moving quantum information between different codes that, together, support a universal gate set. Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the number of code switches required to run a given quantum circuit. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time by reducing it to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the circuit. Our formulation is flexible and can incorporate additional considerations, such as reducing depth overhead by preferring switches during idle periods or biasing the compilation to favor one code over another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated approach for compiling and optimizing code-switching-based quantum computations at the logical level.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Gate Architecture via Teleportation and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal quantum computing architecture which combines the measurement-driven aspect of MBQC with the circuit model's algorithm dependent generation of qubit entanglement. Our architecture, which we call QGATE, is tailored for discrete-variable photonic quantum computers with deterministic photon sources capable of generating 1D entangled photonic states. QGATE achieves universal quantum computing on a logical data qubit register via the implementation of Clifford operations, QGATE ancilla, and arbitrary angle single-qubit measurements. We realise unitary evolutions defined by multi-qubit Pauli strings via the generation of entanglement between a sub-set of logical qubits and a mutual QGATE ancilla qubit. Measurement of the QGATE ancilla in the appropriate basis then implements a given term of the desired unitary operation. This enables QGATE to both directly perform Hamiltonian evolutions in terms of a series of multi-qubit Pauli operators, in terms of projectors for an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian, or realise multi-controlled gates enabling direct translation of circuit models to QGATE. We consider examples inspired by quantum chemistry and computational fluid dynamics. We propose an example photonic implementation of QGATE and calculate thresholds of $10.36\pm0.02\%$ or $25.98\pm0.28\%$ on the photonic loss for logical qubits constructed from foliated rotated surface codes, dependent on the deployment of intra-layer or inter-layer fusion respectively.</description>

      <title>A contextual advantage for conclusive exclusion: repurposing the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Heterogeneous Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks are expected to be heterogeneous systems, combining distinct qubit platforms, photon wavelengths, and device timescales to achieve scalable, multiuser connectivity. Building and iterating on such systems is costly and slow, motivating hardware-faithful simulations to explore architecture design space and justify implementation decisions. This paper presents a framework for simulating heterogeneous quantum networks based on SeQUeNCe, a discrete-event simulator of quantum networks. We introduce faithful device models for two representative platforms - Ytterbium atoms and superconducting qubits. On top of these models, we implement entanglement generation and entanglement swapping protocols for time-bin encoded photons that account for disparate clock rates and quantum frequency conversion and transducer losses/noise brought by the heterogeneity. Using extensive simulations, we map the rate-fidelity trade space and identify the dominant bottlenecks unique to heterogeneous systems. The models are open source and extensible, enabling reproducible evaluation of future heterogeneous designs and protocols.</description>

      <title>Maestro: Intelligent Execution for Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation remains essential for developing and validating quantum algorithms, especially as current quantum hardware is limited in scale and quality. However, the growing diversity of simulation methods and software tools creates a high barrier to selecting the most suitable backend for a given circuit. We introduce Maestro, a unified interface for quantum circuit simulation that integrates multiple simulation paradigms - state vector, MPS, tensor network, stabilizer, GPU-accelerated, and p-block methods - under a single API. Maestro includes a predictive runtime model that automatically selects the optimal simulator based on circuit structure and available hardware, and applies backend-specific optimizations such as multiprocessing, GPU execution, and improved sampling. Benchmarks across heterogeneous workloads demonstrate that Maestro outperforms individual simulators in both single-circuit and large batched settings, particularly in high-performance computing environments. Maestro provides a scalable, extensible platform for quantum algorithm research, hybrid quantum-classical workflows, and emerging distributed quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Unspeakable Coherence Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unspeakable coherence is a key feature separating quantum and classical physics. Modelled as asymmetry with respect to a continuous transformation generated by a physically relevant observable, such as the Hamiltonian or angular moment, unspeakable coherence has been shown to be the relevant notion of coherence for achieving quantum advantage in the tasks of metrology, reference frame alignment and work extraction, among others. A question of both practical and foundational value is: Given some copies of a state with low coherence, can we prepare a more coherent state via coherence non-increasing operations? Here, we study this question in the minimal limiting case: Given two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, can one, via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries, increase the coherence in a subsystem? We fully solve this problem for qubits, identifying the optimal unitaries and revealing the existence of bound coherence. This is then used to create a completely constructive multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol, where only effective-qubit unitaries are used. Unexpectedly, in this protocol, we show that there exists states for which the ratio of the input-output coherence can be amplified unboundedly. Extending beyond qubits, we derive two fundamental upper bounds on the amount of local coherence that can be increased and prove a no-go theorem showing that certain global correlations cannot be converted to local coherence.</description>

      <title>Limits of Perturbation Theory for Multimode Light Propagation in Dispersive Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal modes of quantum light pulses is a promising resource for modern quantum technologies, driving advancements in quantum computing, communication, and metrology. Precise control and manipulation of these modes remain critical challenges, particularly in systems where nonlinear multimode dynamics interact with dispersion effects. In this work, we focus on the role of group velocity dispersion (GVD) within optical cavities - a phenomenon traditionally viewed as detrimental but increasingly recognized as a versatile tool for quantum light manipulation. We present a perturbation-theory-based approach to analyze GVD effects in a synchronously pumped dispersive cavity. By comparing perturbative solutions to rigorous steady-state results, we establish the validity region of the perturbative approach and assess its limitations in multimode systems. Our study identifies key parameters governing the breakdown of perturbation theory, such as mode order, dispersion strength, and cavity decay rates.</description>

      <title>Experimental Sensitivity Enhancement of a Quantum Rydberg Atom-Based RF Receiver with a Metamaterial GRIN Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operator layer cake theorem provides an integral representation for the directional derivative of the operator logarithm in terms of a family of projections [arXiv:2507.06232]. Recently, the related work [arXiv:2507.07065] showed that the theorem gives an alternative proof to Frenkel's integral formula for Umegaki's relative entropy [Quantum, 7:1102 (2023)]. In this short note, we find a converse implication, demonstrating that the operator layer cake theorem is equivalent to Frenkel's integral formula.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Limits of Quantum Certification: When Eve Defeats Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on certifying that observed correlations arise from genuine quantum entanglement rather than eavesdropper manipulation. Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods. We provide corrected methodology using cross-distribution calibration and recommend mandatory adversarial testing for quantum security claims.</description>

      <title>Combined Quantum and Post-Quantum Security Performance Under Finite Keys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum-secure communication have highlighted the value of hybrid schemes that combine Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Yet most existing hybrid designs omit realistic finite-key effects on QKD key rates and do not specify how to maintain security when both QKD and PQC primitives leak information through side-channels. These gaps limit the applicability of hybrid systems in practical, deployed networks. In this work, we advance a recently proposed hybrid QKD-PQC system by integrating tight finite-key security to the QKD primitive and improving the design for better scalability. This hybrid system employs an information-theoretically secure instruction sequence that determines the configurations of different primitives and thus ensures message confidentiality even when both the QKD and the PQC primitives are compromised. The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions.</description>

      <title>Less is more: subspace reduction for counterdiabatic driving of Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of subspace methods in combination with counterdiabatic driving in a Rydberg atom system to solve the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Although exact counterdiabatic driving offers excellent performance, it comes at an unscalable computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate that counterdiabatic driving can be significantly improved by restricting the analysis to a relevant subspace of the system. We first show that both direct diagonalization and the Krylov method for obtaining the counterdiabatic matrix can be accelerated through the use of subspace techniques, while still maintaining strong performance. We then demonstrate that the cost function used in the standard Krylov method can be further optimized by employing a subspace-based cost function. These findings open up new possibilities for applying counterdiabatic driving in a practical and efficient manner to a variety of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum control over non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the control of non-Hermitian quantum systems has a growing interest for their nonunitary feature in the time evolution, the existing discussions are not more than two or three dimensions and heavily influenced by the singularity of the energy spectrum. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling Quantum Interior Point Method for Linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of huge-scale, data-intensive linear optimization (LO) problems in applications such as machine learning has driven the need for more computationally efficient interior point methods (IPMs). While conventional IPMs are polynomial-time algorithms with rapid convergence, their per-iteration cost can be prohibitively high for dense large-scale LO problems. Quantum linear system solvers have shown potential in accelerating the solution of linear systems arising in IPMs. In this work, we introduce a novel almost-exact quantum IPM, where the Newton system is constructed and solved on a quantum computer, while solution updates occur on a classical machine. Additionally, all matrix-vector products are performed on the quantum hardware. This hybrid quantum-classical framework achieves an optimal worst-case scaling of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for fully dense LO problems. To ensure high precision, despite the limited accuracy of quantum operations, we incorporate iterative refinement techniques both within and outside the proposed IPM iterations. The proposed algorithm has a quantum complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5} \kappa_A \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ queries to QRAM and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ classical arithmetic operations. Our method outperforms the worst-case complexity of prior classical and quantum IPMs, offering a significant improvement in scalability and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient Identification the Inequivalence of Mutually Unbiased Bases via Finite Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural characterization of high-dimensional mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) by classifying MUBs subsets remains a major open problem. The existing methods not only fail to conclude on the exact classification, but also are severely limited by computational resources and suffer from the numerical precision problem. Here we introduce an operational approach to identify the inequivalence of MUBs subsets, which has less time complexity and entirely avoids the computational precision issues. For arbitrary MUBs subsets of $k$ elements in any prime dimension, this method yields a universal analytical upper bound for the amount of MUBs equivalence classes. By applying this method through simple iterations, we further obtain tighter classification upper bounds for any prime dimension $d\leq 37$. Crucially, the comparison of these upper bounds with existing lower bounds successfully determines the exact classification for all MUBs subsets in any dimension $d \leq 17$. We further extend this method to the case that the dimension is a power of prime number. This general and scalable framework for the classification of MUBs subsets sheds new light on related applications.</description>

      <title>A Qudit-native Framework for Discrete Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a qudit-native framework for engineering robust discrete time crystals (DTCs) by leveraging their internal multilevel structure. Our approach confines the periodic drive to specified on-site subspaces, creating an embedded kick that suppresses heating by preventing population leakage to inactive levels. We underpin DTC stability with a normal-form analysis that decomposes the effective dynamics into distinct components: the carrier locks the subharmonic frequency, neutral terms govern the slow decay and dephasing of the subharmonic response, and charged terms scatter spectral weight away from the locked modes. This framework's predictive power is demonstrated across various qudit platforms: in spin-1 chains, we enhance the stability of DTC by confining the drive to a subspace; in spin-3/2 systems, we show that robustness is dictated by the symmetry of the subspace partition; and in spin-2 platforms, we realize concurrent 2T and 3T DTCs under a unified drive. These findings establish a systematic, hardware-efficient methodology for designing stable and multifunctional Floquet phases of matter on modern qudit-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations using quantum phase estimation algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.</description>

      <title>Phase noise characterisation of a 2-km Hollow-Core Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fibre for Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) is heavily dependent on the physical properties of the channel over which it is executed. Propagation losses and perturbations in the encoded photons' degrees of freedom, such as polarisation or phase, limit both the QKD range and key rate. The maintenance of phase coherence over optical fibres has lately received considerable attention as it enables QKD over long distances, e.g., through phase-based protocols like Twin-Field (TF) QKD. While optical single mode fibres (SMFs) are the current standard type of fibre, recent hollow core fibres (HCFs) could become a superior alternative in the future. Whereas the co-existence of quantum and classical signals in HCF has already been demonstrated, the phase noise resilience required for phase-based QKD protocols is yet to be established. This work explores the behaviour of HCF with respect to phase noise for the purpose of TF-QKD-like protocols. To achieve this, two experiments are performed. The first, is a set of concurrent measurements on 2 km of HCF and SMF in a double asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration. The second, uses a TF-QKD interferometer consisting of HCF and SMF channels. These initial results indicate that HCF is suitable for use in TF-QKD and other phase-based QKD protocols.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy and phase transitions of Long-range XXZ using VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1</description>

      <title>Probing false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Probing chiral topological states with permutation defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating "permutation defects" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce fermionic neural Gibbs states (fNGS), a variational framework for modeling finite-temperature properties of strongly interacting fermions. fNGS starts from a reference mean-field thermofield-double state and uses neural-network transformations together with imaginary-time evolution to systematically build strong correlations. Applied to the doped Fermi-Hubbard model, a minimal lattice model capturing essential features of strong electronic correlations, fNGS accurately reproduces thermal energies over a broad range of temperatures, interaction strengths, even at large dopings, for system sizes beyond the reach of exact methods. These results demonstrate a scalable route to studying finite-temperature properties of strongly correlated fermionic systems beyond one dimension with neural-network representations of quantum states.</description>

      <title>Watt-level coherent microwave emission from dissipation engineered solid-state quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently proposed metastability-induced quantum batteries have shown particular promise for coherent microwave generation. However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Optimization through Qudit-Based Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution has been shown to be a promising framework for tackling combinatorial optimization problems on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a classical quantum-inspired strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued decision variables by encoding decision variables into multi-level quantum states known as qudits. This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, particularly for larger values of d.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid variational quantum algorithm that has variational parameters used by both the quantum circuit and the subsequent classical optimization. Similar to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), this algorithm applies a parameterized unitary operator to the qubit register. We generate this operator using diabatic state preparation. The quantum measurement results then inform the classical optimization procedure used by the Cascaded Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE). We demonstrate the algorithm on a system of interacting electrons and show how it can be used on long-term error-corrected as well as short-term intermediate-scale quantum computers. Our simulations performed on IBM Brisbane produced energies well within chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Residual Exchange Coupling in Resonant Singlet-Triplet Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose methods to mitigate single- and two-qubit control errors due to residual exchange coupling in systems of exchange-coupled resonant singlet-triplet qubits. Commensurate driving, where the pulse length is an integer multiple of the drive period, can mitigate errors from residual intra-qubit exchange, including effects from counter rotating terms and off-axis rotations, as well as leakage errors during two-qubit operations. Residual inter-qubit exchange creates crosstalk errors that reduce single-qubit control fidelities. We show that using a single-spin coupler between two resonant singlet-triplet qubits can reduce this crosstalk error by an order of magnitude. Assuming perfect coupler state preparation and realistic charge and hyperfine noise, we predict that coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below $3\times10^{-3}$ for gate times as short as $66~\text{ns}$, even in the presence of residual exchange levels exceeding several hundred kHz. Our results suggest the potential of utilizing coupler-based architectures for large scale fault-tolerant spin qubit processors based on resonant singlet-triplet qubits.</description>

      <title>Bayesian stepwise estimation of qubit rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates Bayesian stepwise estimation (Se) for measuring the two parameters of a unitary qubit rotation. While asymptotic analysis predicts a precision advantage for SE over joint estimation (JE) in regimes where the quantum Fisher information matrix is near-singular ("sloppy" models), we demonstrate that this advantage is mitigated within a practical Bayesian framework with limited resources. We experimentally implement a SE protocol using polarisation qubits, achieving uncertainties close to the classical Van Trees bounds. However, comparing the total error to the ultimate quantum Van Trees bound for JE reveals that averaging over prior distributions erases the asymptotic SE advantage. Nevertheless, the stepwise strategy retains a significant practical benefit as it operates effectively with simple, fixed measurements, whereas saturating the JE bound typically requires complex, parameter-dependent operations.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton interference outperforms pairwise overlaps for distinguishability characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol that characterizes the pairwise overlaps of the internal modes of single photons more efficiently than pairwise Hong-Ou-Mandel characterization experiments. This protocol exploits multiphoton interference. We experimentally implement this protocol to characterize three photons. We show that our implementation of the characterization protocol outperforms the pairwise Hong-Ou-Mandel characterization, even if the Hong-Ou-Mandel characterization would have been performed in a noiseless, perfect experiment. We demonstrate this via the Fisher information matrix.</description>

      <title>PVLS: A Learning-based Parameter Prediction Technique for Variational Quantum Linear Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Linear Solvers (VQLS) are a promising method for solving linear systems on near-term quantum devices. However, their performance is often limited by barren plateaus and inefficient parameter initialization, which significantly hinder trainability as the system size increases. In this work, we introduce PVLS, a learning-based parameter prediction framework that uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate high-quality initial parameters for VQLS circuits. By leveraging structural information from the coefficient matrix, PVLS predicts expressive and scalable initializations that improve convergence and reduce optimization difficulty. Extensive experiments on matrix sizes ranging from 16 to 1024 show that PVLS provides up to a 2.6x speedup in optimization and requires fewer iterations while maintaining comparable solution accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of machine-learning-guided initialization strategies for improving the practicality of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Communicating Properties of Quantum States over Classical Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.</description>

      <title>Circuit Quantum Acoustodynamics in a Scalable Phononic Integrated Circuit Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous demonstrations of quantum acoustic systems have been limited to isolated devices, with limited capability to route phonons and interconnect multi-port acoustic elements for further extension. Here, we demonstrate a scalable architecture for circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) by integrating superconducting qubits with suspension-free phononic integrated circuits (PnICs). Coherent coupling between tunable transmon qubits and waveguide-integrated phononic cavities, including Fabry-Perot cavities via monolithic integration and microring cavities via flip-chip assembly, has been achieved, producing a pronounced enhancement of phonon emission with a Purcell factor of ~19. These devices represent elementary building blocks for scalable phononic circuits, establishing the foundation for phonon-based quantum information processors and the testbed for novel quantum acoustic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Convergence of sample-based quantum diagonalization on a variable-length cuprate chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is an algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical molecular simulation that has been of broad interest for application with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, SQD does not always converge on a practical timescale. Here, we explore scaling of the algorithm for a variable-length molecule made up of 2 to 6 copper oxide plaquettes with a minimal molecular orbital basis. The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware. Additionally, we find that noise on a real quantum computer, the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device, can improve energy convergence beyond expectations based on noise-free statevector simulations.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum control: From basic concepts to applications in quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum control refers to our ability to manipulate quantum systems. This tutorial-style chapter focuses on the use of classical electromagnetic fields to steer the system dynamics. In this approach, the quantum nature of the control stems solely from the underlying dynamics, through the exploitation of destructive and constructive interference to reach the control target. We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional. All concepts are illustrated using recent work from my research group, with a focus on controlling atoms and superconducting qubits. The chapter concludes with an outlook on integrating coherent control with engineered dissipation and a discussion of open questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Neutral Atom Gate Set: Native iSWAP and Exchange Gates from Dipolar Rydberg Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a native realization of iSWAP and parameterized exchange gates for neutral atom quantum processing units. Our approach leverages strong dipole-dipole interactions between two dipole-coupled Rydberg states, and employs optimal control techniques to design time-efficient, high-fidelity gate protocols. To minimize experimental complexity, we utilize global driving terms acting identically on all atoms. We implement a noise-aware pulse selection strategy to identify candidate protocols with reduced susceptibility to certain noise sources, then analyze their performance under realistic noise sources -- including atomic motion, Rydberg decay, and experimentally motivated laser phase and intensity noise. For a $^{88}$Sr-based architecture, we demonstrate fast iSWAP gate protocols which exceed fidelities of $99.9\%$ under realistic experimental conditions. These results pave the way for expanding the neutral atom gate set beyond typical Rydberg blockade-based entangling gates.</description>

      <title>QKAN-LSTM: Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-term Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are a particular type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are central to sequential modeling tasks in domains such as urban telecommunication forecasting, where temporal correlations and nonlinear dependencies dominate. However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Quantum Optimization via Quantum Sequence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum processors. However, finding good variational parameters remains a significant challenge due to the non-convex energy landscape, often resulting in slow convergence and poor solution quality. In this work, we propose a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models to generate effective parameter initialization policies. We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a "learning to learn" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic universality across dissipative quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions described by Lindblad dynamics. We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Pump Free Microwave-Optical Quantum Transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing involves superconducting computation nodes operating at microwave frequencies, which are connected by long-distance transmission lines that transmit photons at optical frequencies. Quantum transduction, which coherently converts between microwave and optical (M-O) photons, is a critical component of such an architecture. Current approaches are hindered by the unavoidable problem of device heating due to the optical pump. In this work, we propose a pump-free scheme based on color centers that generates time-bin encoded M-O Bell pairs. Our scheme first creates spin-photon entanglement and then converts the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. In our protocol, the microwave retrieval is heralded by detecting the microwave signal with a three-level transmon. We have analyzed the resulting Bell state fidelity and generation probability of this protocol. Our simulation shows that by combining a state-of-the-art spin-optical interface with our proposed strongly-coupled spin-microwave design, the pump-free scheme can generate M-O Bell pairs at a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz with near-unity fidelity, which establishes the scheme as a promising source for M-O Bell pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a decoy-state quantum key distribution scheme using a telecom C-band single- emitter source. The decoy states are created by varying the optical excitation of the quantum emitter to modulate the photon number distribution. We provide an analysis of our scheme based on existing security proofs, allowing the calculation of secret key rates including finite key effects. This enables us to demonstrate, with a realistic single-photon source, positive secret key rates using our scheme over 227 km of optical fiber, equivalent to a loss tolerance one order of magnitude greater than non-decoy schemes. This work broadens the scope of single-photon sources in future quantum networks by enabling long-distance QKD with realistic levels of single-photon purity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper considers the propagation of Laguerre-Gaussian beams in a turbulent gas medium. As demonstrated by numerical modelling and the decomposition of Laguerre-Gaussian modes according to the basis of orthogonal Zernike polynomials, disparities in the stability of Laguerre-Gaussian modes with differing radial and azimuthal numbers are evident. The demonstration is made of the minimization of the distortion of the transverse beam profile with an increase in the radial number.</description>

      <title>Deformed LDPC codes with spontaneously broken non-invertible duality symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a well known class of Pauli stabiliser Hamiltonians that furnish fixed-point realisations of nontrivial gapped phases such as symmetry breaking and topologically ordered (including fracton) phases. In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.
  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.
  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Entanglement membrane in the Brownian SYK chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that entanglement dynamics in chaotic many-body quantum systems in the limit of large subsystems and long times is described by an entanglement membrane effective theory. In this paper, we derive the membrane description in a solvable chaotic large-$N$ model, the Brownian SYK chain. This model has a collective field description in terms of fermion bilinears connecting different folds of the multifold Schwinger-Keldysh path integral used to compute R\'enyi entropies. The entanglement membrane is a traveling wave solution of the saddle point equations governing these collective fields. The entanglement membrane is characterised by a velocity $v$ and a membrane tension ${\cal E}(v)$ that we calculate. We find that the membrane has finite width for $v&lt;v_B$ (the butterfly velocity), however for $v &gt; v_B$, the membrane splits into two wave fronts, each moving with the butterfly velocity.

      <title>Asymmetric excitation of left- vs right-handed photons in accelerating waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic duality symmetry of Maxwell's equations in vacuum implies that the circular polarization $Q$ of classical electromagnetic waves is conserved. In quantum field theory, the normal-ordered operator $\hat Q$ represents the difference between the number operators of right- and left-handed photons. Previous studies have shown that its expectation value is not conserved for observers propagating in a gravitational field. Here, we show that this Noether symmetry can also be realized in empty waveguides with duality-preserving boundary conditions, and we quantize the source-free Maxwell theory inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. In the vacuum $|0\rangle$ associated to inertial observers, we find that the expectation value $\langle 0| \hat Q |0\rangle $ fails to be conserved for observers co-moving with the waveguide. In particular, frame-dragging effects induce a spectral asymmetry between the right- and left-handed field modes at late times. As a consequence, accelerated detectors co-moving with the rotating waveguide can detect photon-pair excitations from the quantum vacuum, exhibiting an imbalance between opposite helicity modes. This is a relativistic quantum effect, which shows that the classical conservation law associated with duality symmetry is broken in the quantum theory even in flat spacetime, provided we work with non-inertial systems. Our analysis provides a concrete proof of concept for testing this effect in analogue gravity platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored dynamics of many-body quantum systems in which projective measurements of extensive operators are alternated with unitary evolution. Focusing on mean-field models characterized by all-to-all interactions, we develop a general framework that captures the thermodynamic limit, where a semiclassical description naturally emerges. Remarkably, we uncover novel stationary states, distinct from the conventional infinite-temperature state, that arise upon taking the infinite-volume limit. Counterintuitively, this phenomenon is not linked to the closing of the Lindbladian gap in that limit. We provide analytical explanation for this unexpected behavior.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of the stability (with sharp exponent) of the Lieb--Solovej inequality for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states, which was obtained only recently by the authors. Here, we propose an elementary proof of this result, based on reformulating the Wehrl-type entropy as a function defined on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^d$, for some suitable $d$, and on some explicit (and somewhat surprising) computations.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Interconnects via Phase-Coherent Four-Wave Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (&gt;99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>In-plane anomalous features in the 3D quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) have primarily emphasized transport features that mimic the well-established 2D QHE. In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties. It opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a proposal of Kitaev for a microscopic construction of a Hamiltonian intended to describe the edge dynamics of a quantum Hall system. We show that the construction works in the setting of translation-invariant free-fermion Hamiltonians. In this case, the resulting edge Hamiltonian exhibits only edge modes, and these modes have the correct chirality.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc as the holonomy of the Hopf fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a simple kinematical model of a disc (Disc B) rolling on the edge of a fixed disc (Disc A) to study the geometric nature of rotation. The total rotation angle $\Delta$ of Disc B after one cycle is decomposed into a dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and a geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The paper's main contribution is to demonstrate that this geometric phase can be essentially described as the $U(1)$ holonomy of the Hopf fibration with the canonical connection. By using a Gauss map to represent the disc's motion as a curve on a two-sphere ($S^2$), the work connects the physical rotation to the underlying geometry of the Hopf fiber bundle $S^3 \to S^2$ and clarifies the origin of the geometric phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending optical nonlinearity into the extremely weak light regime is at the heart of quantum optics, since it enables the efficient generation of photonic entanglement and implementation of photonic quantum logic gate. Here, we demonstrate the capability for continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity, enabled by precise control of Rydberg interaction over two orders of magnitude, through the use of microwave-assisted wave-function engineering. To characterize this nonlinearity, light storage and retrieval protocol utilizing Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency is employed, and the quantum statistics of the retrieved photons are analyzed. As a first application, we demonstrate our protocol can speed up the preparation of single photons in low-lying Rydberg states by a factor of up to ~ 40. Our work holds the potential to accelerate quantum operations and to improve the circuit depth and connectivity in Rydberg systems, representing a crucial step towards scalable quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Collective cluster nucleation dynamics in 2D Ising quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting many-body systems often show collective properties that are non-trivially related to the microscopic degrees of freedom. Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology.</description>

      <title>Fast and efficient formation of stable tetraatomic molecules from ultracold atoms via generalized stimulated Raman exact passage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetraatomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetraatomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for enabling the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetraatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and the unexpected regularity of density functional theory in one spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the (Kohn-Sham) density-to-potential map in the case of spinless fermions in one spatial dimension, whose existence has been rigorously established by the first author in [arXiv:2504.05501 (2025)]. Here, we focus on the regularity of this map as a function of the density and the coupling constant in front of the interaction term. More precisely, we first prove a quantitative version of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, thereby showing that this map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the natural Sobolev norms in the space of densities and potentials. In particular, this implies that the inverse (Kohn-Sham) problem is not only well-posed but also Lipschitz stable. Using this result, we then show that the density-to-potential map is in fact real analytic with respect to both the density and the interaction strength. As a consequence, we obtain a holomorphic extension of the universal constrained-search functional to a suitable subset of complex-valued densities. This partially extends the DFT framework to non-self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators. As further applications of these results, we also establish the existence of an exchange-only part of the exchange-correlation potential, and justify the G\"orling-Levy perturbation expansion for the correlation energy.</description>

      <title>Instantons meet resonances: Unifying two seemingly distinct approaches to quantum tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of quantum-mechanical tunneling processes, numerous approaches have been developed to determine the decay rate of states initially confined within a metastable potential region. Virtually all analytical treatments, however, fall into one of two superficially unrelated conceptual frameworks: the resonant-state approach and the instanton method. Whereas the concept of resonant states and their associated decay widths is grounded in physical reasoning by capturing the regime of uniform probability decay, the instanton method lacks a comparably clear physical interpretation. We demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches, revealing that the contour-deformation prescription in the functional integral put forward by Callan and Coleman directly corresponds to the outgoing Gamow--Siegert boundary conditions defining resonant states.</description>

Abstract: In [Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234], De Palma and Trevisan described a one-to-one correspondence between quantum couplings and quantum channels realizing transport between states. The aim of this short note is to demonstrate that taking the Petz recovery map for a given channel and initial state is precisely the counterpart of the swap transpose operation on couplings. That is, the swap transpose of the coupling $\Pi_{\Phi}$ corresponding to the channel $\Phi$ and initial state $\rho$ is the coupling $\Pi_{rec}$ corresponding to the Petz recovery map $\Phi_{rec}.$</description>

      <title>Exploring vibronic dynamics near a sloped conical intersection with trapped Rydberg ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spin-phonon coupled dynamics in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection created by laser coupling the electronic (spin) and vibrational degrees of freedom of a pair of trapped Rydberg ions. We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection. The initial state is revived, and is almost entirely irrelevant to whether it is from the lower or upper potential surface. Complete Rabi oscillations of the adiabatic states are found when the wavepacket is initialized on the upper potential surface. The dynamics occur on the microsecond and nanometer scales, implying that Rydberg ions provide a platform for simulating nonadiabatic processes in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection.</description>

      <title>Operator Formalism for Laser-Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an operator-based framework for laser--plasma wakefield acceleration (LPWA) in capillary discharges, providing a compact and systematic description of the coupled dynamics of laser fields and plasma response. The formalism employs key operators: the transverse modal operator $\hat{K}$, the nonlinear plasma operator $\hat{N}[\Psi]$, the plasma oscillation operator $\hat{\Omega}_p^{\,2}$, and the ponderomotive source operator $\hat{\alpha}$, which together describe mode coupling, plasma oscillations, and nonlinear feedback induced by the ponderomotive force. In the linear regime, the system is characterized by invariant subspaces associated with stable modal structures, while nonlinear interactions break these invariances, leading to mode mixing and complex dynamics. The approach establishes a direct connection between LPWA and Hilbert-space operator theory, including the invariant subspace, providing a formal mathematical interpretation of energy transfer and wakefield formation. Furthermore, the operator formalism integrates with neural operator methods, allowing efficient approximation of $\hat{N}$ and $\hat{\alpha}$ for reduced-order modeling and predictive control. This hybrid physics--AI framework offers a robust foundation for modeling, analysis, and optimization of high-intensity laser--plasma interactions in next-generation accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>Hall-like response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite Hall-like transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the B\"uttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.</description>

      <title>The Magnus expansion in relativistic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Magnus expansion of the $N$-operator in relativistic quantum field theory, which is related to the $S$-matrix via $S = e^{iN}$. We develop direct methods to compute matrix elements of the $N$-operator, which we refer to as Magnus amplitudes, bypassing scattering amplitudes entirely. At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations. Given that Magnus amplitudes are free of hyper-classical terms, and the known relations between Magnus amplitudes and the radial action, our results lay the groundwork for systematic and efficient calculations of classical observables from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ER=EPR from non-local gravitational energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of wormhole geometries supported by the non-local gravitational self-energy that regularizes the particle and black-hole sectors of spacetime. Using this framework, inspired by T-duality, we show that two entangled particles (or particle-black-hole pairs) naturally source an Einstein-Rosen-type geometry in which the required violation of the strong energy condition arises from intrinsic quantum-gravity effects rather than from ad hoc exotic matter, which is matter that violates the null energy condition. We classify the resulting wormholes, analyze their horizons, throat structure and embedding properties, and we identify the exotic energy needed at the minimal surface. Imposing the ER=EPR requirement of non-traversability and the absence of a macroscopic throat, we find that only the zero-throat geometry is compatible with an entanglement-induced Einstein-Rosen bridge, providing a concrete realization of ER=EPR within a fully regular spacetime. Finally, we briefly discuss possible implications for microscopic ER networks from vacuum fluctuations, replica-wormhole interpretations of Hawking radiation, and possible links to entanglement-driven dark-energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Qubit Control in a Natural Si-MOS Quantum Dot using a 300 mm Silicon on Insulator Wafer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate high-fidelity single qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot fabricated in an industrial 300 mm wafer process on a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer using electron spin resonance. A relatively high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz is achieved, dynamically decoupling the electron spin from its 29-Si environment. Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $\mu$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoders for Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly-based intrusion detection requires models that can generalize to attack patterns not observed during training. This work presents the first large-scale evaluation of hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) autoencoders for this task. We construct a unified experimental framework that iterates over key quantum design choices, including quantum-layer placement, measurement approach, variational and non-variational formulations, and latent-space regularization. Experiments across three benchmark NIDS datasets show that HQC autoencoders can match or exceed classical performance in their best configurations, although they exhibit higher sensitivity to architectural decisions. Under zero-day evaluation, well-configured HQC models provide stronger and more stable generalization than classical and supervised baselines. Simulated gate-noise experiments reveal early performance degradation, indicating the need for noise-aware HQC designs. These results provide the first data-driven characterization of HQC autoencoder behavior for network intrusion detection and outline key factors that govern their practical viability. All experiment code and configurations are available at https://github.com/arasyi/hqcae-network-intrusion-detection.</description>

      <title>Multimode RF Reflectometry for Spin Qubit Readout and Device Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multimode superconducting inductor architecture that enables radio-frequency reflectometry at multiple discrete frequencies up to 2 GHz, addressing limitations of conventional single-mode designs. The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization.</description>

      <title>Towards practical secure delegated quantum computing with semi-classical light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure Delegated Quantum Computation (SDQC) protocols are a vital piece of the future quantum information processing global architecture since they allow end-users to perform their valuable computations on remote quantum servers without fear that a malicious quantum service provider or an eavesdropper might acquire some information about their data or algorithm. They also allow end-users to check that their computation has been performed as they have specified it.
  However, existing protocols all have drawbacks that limit their usage in the real world. Most require the client to either operate a single-qubit source or perform single-qubit measurements, thus requiring them to still have some quantum technological capabilities albeit restricted, or require the server to perform operations which are hard to implement on real hardware (e.g isolate single photons from laser pulses and polarisation-preserving photon-number quantum non-demolition measurements). Others remove the need for quantum communications entirely but this comes at a cost in terms of security guarantees and memory overhead on the server's side.
  We present an SDQC protocol which drastically reduces the technological requirements of both the client and the server while providing information-theoretic composable security. More precisely, the client only manipulates an attenuated laser pulse, while the server only handles interacting quantum emitters with a structure capable of generating spin-photon entanglement. The quantum emitter acts as both a converter from coherent laser pulses to polarisation-encoded qubits and an entanglement generator. Such devices have recently been used to demonstrate the largest entangled photonic state to date, thus hinting at the readiness of our protocol for experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of quantum annealing via n-local catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential quantum speedup in solving optimization problems via adiabatic quantum annealing is often hindered by the closing of the energy gap during the anneal, especially when this gap scales exponentially with system size. In this work, we alleviate this bottleneck by demonstrating that for the NP-complete Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, an informed choice of $n-$local catalysts (operators involving $n$ qubits) can re-open the gap during the annealing process. By analyzing first-order phase transitions in toy instances of the MWIS problem, we first identify direct-tunneling catalysts that effectively eliminate the transition and provide an analytical discussion on when the sign of the catalyst influences its impact. We then reveal that $n-$local catalysts exponentially improve gap scaling and in certain scenarios are as effective as direct tunnel coupling between two minima. Utilizing this understanding, we show that they also increase the efficiency of ground state preparation via adiabatic quantum annealing in random graphs and analytically demonstrate the necessity of their placement across unfrustrated loops in the graph for effective performance in MWIS problems. Additionally, using a circuit implementation of the $n$-local catalyst (requiring $2n$ nearest-neighbour gates), we demonstrate that both the circuit depth and the total number of gates required to solve the problem are reduced by several orders of magnitude when compared to the discrete-time version of traditional quantum annealing using local drivers. Our analysis suggests that non-local quantum fluctuations entangling multiple qubits as a catalyst are key to achieving the desired quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Circuit Cutting Framework for Sampling Overhead Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently developed quantum circuit cutting technique greatly extends the capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, it introduces substantial overhead in both classical postprocessing and quantum resources, as the postprocessing complexity and sampling cost scale exponentially with the number of circuit cuts. In this work, we propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework, ShotQC, which effectively reduces the sampling overhead through two key optimizations: shot distribution and cut parameterization. The former employs an adaptive Monte Carlo strategy to dynamically allocate more quantum resources to subcircuit configurations that contribute more to the variance in the final outcome. The latter exploits additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing to further suppress variance. Integrating these optimizations, ShotQC significantly reduces the sampling overhead without increasing classical postprocessing complexity, as demonstrated across a range of benchmark circuits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to transform computational paradigms across science and industry. As the field evolves, it can benefit from established classical methodologies, including promising paradigms such as Transfer of Knowledge (ToK). This work serves as a brief, self-contained reference for ToK, unifying its core principles under a single formal framework. We introduce a joint notation that consolidates and extends prior work in Transfer Learning and Transfer Optimization, bridging traditionally separate research lines and enabling a common language for knowledge reuse. Building on this foundation, we classify existing ToK strategies and principles into a structured taxonomy that helps researchers position their methods within a broader conceptual map. We then extend key transfer protocols to quantum computing, introducing two novel use cases--reverse annealing and multitasking Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)--alongside a sequential Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) approach that supports and validates prior findings. These examples highlight ToK's potential to improve performance and generalization in quantum algorithms. Finally, we outline challenges and opportunities for integrating ToK into quantum computing, emphasizing its role in reducing resource demands and accelerating problem-solving. This work lays the groundwork for future synergies between classical and quantum computing through a shared, transferable knowledge framework.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Point-Gap Interactions Unveil the Mirage Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topology has revolutionized our understanding of energy gaps and band topology, unveiling phases that do not exist within the Hermitian framework. Nonetheless, its fundamental implications for quantum interactions in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel interaction mechanism by examining a quantum-optical system where quantum emitters interact through the photonic band-gap of a dissipative photon bath with periodic boundaries, described by a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Although localized photons within the gap should inhibit interactions between emitters in certain regimes, we find that long-range interactions emerge, defying conventional expectations. These anomalous interactions are mediated by a ``mirage bath" - a virtual bath that unfolds onto a distinct layer of the Riemann surface. This mirage bath generates emitter dynamics identical to those produced by the physical bath but possesses distinct band topology. Crucially, the interactions inherit the topology of the mirage bath, not the physical one. This bath duality is inherent to any dissipative bath with spectral topology, leading to a fundamentally new mechanism for long-range interactions and correlations across the multi-layered Riemann surface, unseen in traditional settings. Our findings open new avenues in quantum optics, many-body quantum simulations, and offer fresh insights into non-Hermitian topology.</description>

Abstract: The theory of purified pseudomodes [arXiv:2412.04264 (2024)] was recently developed to provide a numerical tool for the analysis of the properties of a quantum system and the environment it couples to via linear system-bath interactions. Here we extend this theory to allow for the description of general nonlinear system-bath interactions. We demonstrate the validity of our method by considering the spontaneous decay of a two-level atom placed inside a single-mode lossy cavity and furthermore, its potential application to nanophotonics by calculating the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a quantum dot in the presence of a phonon environment. Our method provides a useful tool for the study of phonon-assisted emission in quantum dots and holds the the promise for broad applications in fields like quantum biology, nonlinear phononics, and nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable features that distinguish open systems from closed ones is the presence of exceptional points (EPs), where two or more eigenvectors of a non-Hermitian operator coalesce, accompanying the convergence of the correcponding eigenvalues. So far, EPs have been demonstrated on a number of platforms, ranging from classical optical systems to fully quantum-mechanical spin-boson models. In these demonstrations, the reservoir that induced the non-Hermiticity was treated as a Markovian one, without considering its memory effect. We here present the first experimental demonstration of non-Markovian quantum EPs, engineered by coupling a Josephson-junction-based qubit to a leaky electromagnetic resonator, which acts as a non-Markovian reservoir. We map out the spectrum of the extended Liouvillian superoperator by observing the quantum state evolution of the qubit and the pseudomode, in which the memory of the reservoir is encoded. We identify a two-fold second-order EP and a third-order EP in the Liouvillian spectrum, which cannot be realized with a Markovian reservoir. Our results pave the way for experimental exploration of exotic phenomena associated with non-Markovian quantum EPs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve three important problems that are revealed, in particular, in matrix-manipulation algorithms. The principal novelty is introducing the concept of controlled measurement that solves the problem of small access probability to the desired state of ancilla and possesses several remarkable properties. We also introduce separate encoding of the real and imaginary parts of a complex matrix that allows to include the Hermitian conjugation into the list of matrix manipulations. Finally, we weaken the constraints on the modulus of matrix elements unavoidably imposed by the normalization condition for a pure quantum state. The controlled measurement together with both other extensions are implemented into the matrix multiplication algorithm. The appropriate circuits are presented.</description>

      <title>Short remarks on shallow unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (i) We point out that every local unitary circuit of depth smaller than the linear system size is easily distinguished from a global Haar random unitary if there is a conserved quantity that is a sum of local operators. This is always the case with a continuous onsite symmetry or with a local energy conservation law. (ii) We explain a simple algorithm for a formulation of the shallow unitary circuit learning problem and relate it to an open question on strictly locality-preserving unitaries (quantum cellular automata). (iii) We show that any translation-invariant quantum cellular automaton in $D$-dimensional lattice of volume $V$ can be implemented using only $O(V)$ local gates in a staircase fashion using invertible subalgebra pumping.</description>

      <title>Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Bending hyperplanes: nonlinear entanglement witnesses via envelopes of linear witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive semidefiniteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally to arbitrary positive but not completely positive (PnCP) maps, leading to nonlinear analogs of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Secure key distribution based on Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction of dimensionally restricted nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the bipartite Bell scenario with two inputs and two outputs, a nonlinear witness of dimensionally restricted nonlocality is introduced. Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box fraction of dimensionally restricted nonlocality is then introduced and studied using the aforementioned witness and a nonlinear measure of correlations. This PR box fraction is also nonzero for certain Bell-local correlations. It is shown that any nonsignaling correlation shared by Alice and Bob that has dimensionally restricted nonlocality contains secrecy against any third party, Eve, who is also dimensionally restricted. In this context, for the specific Bell scenario considered, it is demonstrated that the PR box fraction of dimensionally restricted nonlocality can be used as a resource for secure quantum key distribution, even if entanglement is not certified.</description>

      <title>Forward-Time Equivalent of a "Retrocausal" Diffusion Hidden Variable Model for Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed stochastic hidden variable model for quantum mechanics has been claimed to involve "retrocausality" due to the appearance of equations of motion with future-time boundary conditions. We formulate an equivalent system of forward-time equations of motion that gives rise to the same trajectories as solutions, but involves only initial-time boundary conditions. The forward-time dynamics involves a guidance term for the dynamical variables, determined by the phase-space distribution corresponding to a quantum wavefunction. We show, however, that this particular guidance term can be recovered as the mean-field limit of averaged pairwise interactions among an ensemble of finitely many particles.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality on a triangular Rydberg array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations can drive continuous phase transitions between two distinct ordered phases -- so-called deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) -- which lie beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. Despite several theoretical predictions over the past decades, experimental evidence of DQCPs remains elusive. We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms arranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals interactions. Specifically, we investigate the nature of the phase transition between two ordered phases at 1/3 and 2/3 Rydberg excitation density, which were recently probed experimentally in [P. Scholl et al., Nature 595, 233 (2021)]. Using a field-theoretical analysis, we predict both the critical exponents for infinitely long cylinders of increasing circumference and the emergence of a conformal field theory near criticality showing an enlarged U(1) symmetry -- a signature of DQCPs -- and confirm these predictions numerically. Finally, we extend these results to ladder geometries and show how the emergent U(1) symmetry could be probed experimentally using finite tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Phase Transition and Statistical Properties in Dicke-Stark Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the energy spectrum and thermal equilibrium states of the finite-size Dicke-Stark model were numerically obtained within the extended coherent state space by solving the dressed master equation for strongly coupled light-atom systems. The critical point of the superradiant phase transition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived using the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay two-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the finite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases, the light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching and then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and minimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding coupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and spin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while strong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system state. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature and vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in Dicke-Stark systems.</description>

      <title>Formalizing contextuality in sequential scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a framework for characterizing sequential scenarios, allowing for the identification of contextuality given empirical data, and then provides precise operational interpretations in terms of the possible hidden variable model explanations. Sequential scenarios are different in essence from non-local scenarios and standard frameworks for contextuality as each instrument is allowed to change the state as it enters subsequent instruments. Thus, it is necessary to formulate the possible state update in any hidden variable model description. Here we explore such hidden variable models for sequential scenarios, and we develop on the notion of no-disturbance: an instrument $A$ does not disturb another instrument $B$ if the statistics of $B$ are independent of whether $A$ was measured or not. We define non-contextuality inequalities for the sequential scenario, and show that violation implies that the data cannot be explained by a hidden variable model that is both deterministic and not disturbing in this sense. We further provide a translation from standard contextuality frameworks to ours, providing sequential versions which carry over the same inequalities and measures of contextuality, but now with the sequential interpretations stated.</description>

      <title>Quantum Origin of Diffraction from Bright and Dark States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the recently introduced particle interpretation of the double-slit experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133603 (2025)] which attributes interference phenomena to detector-coupled (bright) and detector-uncoupled (dark) states of light, we develop a continuous-mode extension of the bright- and dark-state framework. This extension addresses a conceptual distinction between interference and diffraction, that is, the transition from a finite set of discrete paths to a continuum of modes. Through the construction of a complete detector-oriented basis for single-slit diffraction, we demonstrate that the observed diffraction pattern arises from projection of the photon state onto a single bright mode by identifying the detectable and undetectable modes, with photons detected at intensity minima having zero probability, as they reside in modes spanning an infinite-dimensional dark subspace. Our approach thus provides a unified particle-based explanation of diffraction that connects quantum and classical wave optics, and reveals distinctive quantum signatures in higher-order correlations.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.</description>

      <title>Enabling Fast and Accurate Neutral Atom Readout through Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of thousands or more qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout. Parallel measurement of qubit arrays currently takes milliseconds, much longer than the underlying quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement, long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution. Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but unreliable readout.
  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework, GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise measurement of spatial attitude parameters is critical for applications in inertial navigation, industrial monitoring, instrument calibration, quantum metrology, etc. In this work, we theoretically investigate and experimentally realize the simultaneous measurement of the yaw and pitch angles using a Hermite-Gaussian-postselected double weak value system integrated with two sets of high-order-mode balanced homodyne detections, thereby achieving a complete characterization of the beam deflection. Signals of the yaw and pitch angles that are involved in TEM$_{10}$ and TEM$_{01}$ modes output from two dark ports of the system can be measured independently. As a result, the obtained minimum measurable yaw and pitch angles of beam deflection are 83 prad and 89 prad, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding displacements are 0.79 pm and 0.85 pm, respectively. This work expands the beam deflection measurement to two dimensions, which provides a new insight for future high-precision multi-parameter spatial precise detection.</description>

Abstract: This perspective outlines promising pathways and critical obstacles on the road to developing useful quantum computing applications, drawing on insights from the Google Quantum AI team. We propose a five-stage framework for this process, spanning from theoretical explorations of quantum advantage to the practicalities of compilation and resource estimation. For each stage, we discuss key trends, milestones, and inherent scientific and sociological impediments. We argue that two central stages -- identifying concrete problem instances expected to exhibit quantum advantage, and connecting such problems to real-world use cases -- represent essential and currently under-resourced challenges. Throughout, we touch upon related topics, including the promise of generative artificial intelligence for aspects of this research, criteria for compelling demonstrations of quantum advantage, and the future of compilation as we enter the era of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive and pedagogical formulation of Bayesian multiparameter quantum estimation, providing explicit conditions for achieving minimum quadratic losses. Within this framework, we analyse the role of measurement incompatibility and establish its quantitative effect on attainable precision. We achieve this by deriving upper bounds based on the pretty good measurement -- a notion originally developed for hypothesis testing -- combined with the evaluation of the Nagaoka--Hayashi lower bound. In general, we prove that, as in the many-copy regime of local estimation theory, incompatibility can at most double the minimum loss relative to the idealised scenario in which individually optimal measurements are assumed jointly implementable. This result implies that, in many practical situations, the latter may provide a sufficient and computationally efficient benchmark without solving the full optimisation problem. Our results, which we illustrate through a range of applications, including discrete quantum phase imaging, phase and dephasing estimation, and qubit sensing, provide analytical and numerical tools for assessing ultimate precision limits and the role of measurement incompatibility in Bayesian multiparameter quantum metrology. We also provide an open-source package that implements all bounds discussed here, enabling practical evaluation and comparison across quantum metrological models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) combines quantum computing and federated learning to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy. QFL can improve computational efficiency and scalability by taking advantage of quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. However, existing QFL frameworks largely focus on homogeneity among quantum \textcolor{black}{clients, and they do not account} for real-world variances in quantum data distributions, encoding techniques, hardware noise levels, and computational capacity. These differences can create instability during training, slow convergence, and reduce overall model performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth examination of heterogeneity in QFL, classifying it into two categories: data or system heterogeneity. Then we investigate the influence of heterogeneity on training convergence and model aggregation. We critically evaluate existing mitigation solutions, highlight their limitations, and give a case study that demonstrates the viability of tackling quantum heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss potential future research areas for constructing robust and scalable heterogeneous QFL frameworks.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal transmission in a cavity-magnon system by rotational Sagnac effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Escaping Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Algorithms Using Negative Learning Rate in Quantum Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are becoming the primary computational primitive for next-generation quantum computers, particularly those embedded as resource-constrained accelerators in the emerging Quantum Internet of Things (QIoT). However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modulation of Long Range Photon Magnon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence of non-hermitian behavior has been recently demonstrated in cavity magnonics, including the emergence of mode level attraction and exceptional points in spectroscopic measurements. This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics. Our approach offers in situ tunability over the dissipative coupling strength, including complete suppression, without requiring physical modifications to the experimental setup, providing a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism for continuous-time quantum Markov semigroups: the detailed balance condition, entropy, pressure and equilibrium quantum processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ denotes the set of $n$ by $n$ complex matrices. Consider continuous time quantum semigroups $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$, where $\mathcal{L}:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the infinitesimal generator. If we assume that $\mathcal{L}(I)=0$, we will call $e^{t\, \mathcal{L}}$, $t \geq 0$ a quantum Markov semigroup. Given a stationary density matrix $\rho= \rho_{\mathcal{L}}$, for the quantum Markov semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t$, $t \geq 0$, we can define a continuous time stationary quantum Markov process, denoted by $X_t$, $t \geq 0.$ Given an {\it a priori} Laplacian operator $\mathcal{L}_0:M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$, we will present a natural concept of entropy for a class of density matrices on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Given an Hermitian operator $A:\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^n$ (which plays the role of an Hamiltonian), we will study a version of the variational principle of pressure for $A$. A density matrix $\rho_A$ maximizing pressure will be called an equilibrium density matrix. From $\rho_A$ we will derive a new infinitesimal generator $\mathcal{L}_A$. Finally, the continuous time quantum Markov process defined by the semigroup $\mathcal{P}_t= e^{t\, \mathcal{L}_A}$, $t \geq 0$, and an initial stationary density matrix, will be called the continuous time equilibrium quantum Markov process for the Hamiltonian $A$. It corresponds to the quantum thermodynamical equilibrium for the action of the Hamiltonian $A$.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the self-interactions present in the effective field theory formulation of general relativity can couple gravitational wave modes and generate nonclassical states. The output of gravitational nonlinear processes can also be sensitive to quantum features of the input states, indicating that nonlinearities can act both as sources and detectors of quantum features of gravitational waves. Due to gauge and quantization issues in strongly curved spacetimes, we work in the geometric optics limit of gravitational radiation, but we expect the key ideas extend to situations of astrophysical interest. This offers a new direction for probing the quantum nature of gravity, analogous to how the quantumness of electrodynamics was established through quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Bound states of quasiparticles with quartic dispersion in an external potential: WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin semiclassical method is formulated for quasiparticles with quartic-in-momentum dispersion which presents the simplest case of a soft energy-momentum dispersion. It is shown that matching wave functions in the classically forbidden and allowed regions requires the consideration of higher-order Airy-type functions. The asymptotics of these functions are found by using the method of steepest descents and contain additional exponentially suppressed contributions known as hyperasymptotics. These hyperasymptotics are crucially important for the correct matching of wave functions in vicinity of turning points for higher-order differential equations. A quantization condition for bound state energies is obtained, which generalizes the standard Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for particles with quadratic energy-momentum dispersion and contains non-perturbative in $\hbar$ correction. This non-perturbative correction, usually associated with tunneling effects or the presence of complex turning points, occurs even for the harmonic potential with quartic dispersion where complex turning points and tunneling are absent. The quantization condition is used to find bound state energies in the case of quadratic and quartic potentials.</description>

      <title>Droplet-gas phases and their dynamical formation in particle imbalanced mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the ground state phase diagram and nonequilibrium dynamics of genuine two-component particle-imbalanced droplets in both isotropic and anisotropic three-dimensional confinements. A gradual transition from mixed droplet-gas to gas configurations is revealed as the average intercomponent attraction decreases or the transverse confinement becomes tighter. Within the mixed structures, a specific majority fragment binds to the minority droplet, satisfying the density ratio locking condition, while the remaining atoms are in a gas state. Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency experimental techniques. These allow to dynamically identify the resilience of the droplet fragment and the expansion of the gas fraction. Our results, amenable to current experimental cold atom settings, are expected to guide forthcoming investigations aiming to reveal unseen out-of-equilibrium droplet dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system, establish its well-posedness, and prove propagation of chaos for multi-class bosonic systems with blockwise interactions.

Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the local nonfreeness, an unbiased measure of correlation between electrons at a single lattice site, can be computed as the mutual information between local natural spin orbitals. This leads us to prove a general result: local electron correlations in Hubbard-type models are fully classical since the local reduced density matrix is separable in the natural basis and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. These results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and nonlocal entanglement, and they provide a clear path for the study of the relationship between traditional quantum resources and the nonfreeness, in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the range of validity of the semiclassical approximation of a quantum master equation designed to describe the $c\bar{c}$ dynamics in a quark gluon plasma at various temperatures, in the quantum Brownian regime. We perform a comparative study of various properties, e.g. the charmonia yield, of the Wigner density obtained with the Lindblad equation and with the associated semiclassical Fokker-Planck equation. The semiclassical description is found to reproduce with a remarkable accuracy the results obtained through the full quantum description. We show that, to a large extent, this can be attributed to the non-unitary components of the dynamics that result from the contact of the $c\bar{c}$ subsystem with the thermal bath, leading to a rapid classicalization of the subsystem.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interaction that gives rise to gravity, involving chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and it does not invoke relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. SDCs might provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical prediction of the magnitude of the cosmological constant, a justification for why the vacuum does not source gravity, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant weakening over time in agreement with some evidence, certain dark matter effects, and a proposal about how gravity arises from QFT.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of tests of locality and of entanglement versus non-entanglement at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued more than 30 years ago that it is not possible to test locality at colliders, due to the inability to directly measure non-commutating observables such as spin components in current collider experiments. Recently, there has been a lot of phenomenological and experimental activity around testing locality via Bell-type experiments or entanglement versus non-entanglement in a collider environment. These results seem to evade the earlier no-go theorem by indirectly measuring spin correlations via their relation to angular correlations between momenta. We perform a careful study of the feasibility of such an approach. We scrutinize the relationship between spin and angular correlations in both quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories. Our conclusion is that it is currently not possible to perform a logically coherent set of experimental measurements at colliders that would allow one to test locality or entanglement versus non-entanglement. This reaffirms the earlier no-go theorem. We stress that the no-go theorem does not apply to measurements of observables inspired from entanglement and Quantum Information Theory to test the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dial for High-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13518</link>

Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear optical process that typically requires an intense laser to trigger emissions at integer multiples of the driving field frequency. However, the strong fields required for conventional HHG inevitably perturb the system, limiting its use as a nondestructive spectroscopic probe. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) sources have created opportunities to drive HHG with quantum fields alone. In this work, we demonstrate a regime in which the light-matter interactions can be controlled and tuned using a weak classical field, whose pulse energy is two orders of magnitude lower than that in standard HHG-perturbed by an even weaker quantum field such as BSV. This approach opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials while substantially suppressing strong laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. We show that a BSV pulse containing less than 5% of the classical driving energy can act as an 'optical dial', allowing tuning of the nonlinear emission spectrum, emission angular dependence, and ionization.</description>

      <title>Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.
  The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.
  Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping supersymmetric (matrix) quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the quantum-mechanics bootstrap to supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and to its matrix relative, the Marinari-Parisi model, which is conjectured to describe the worldvolume of unstable $D0$ branes. Using positivity of moment matrices together with Heisenberg, gauge, and (zero-temperature) thermal constraints, we obtain rigorous bounds on ground-state data. In the cases where SUSY is spontaneously broken, we find bounds that apply to the lowest-energy normalizable eigenstate.
  For $N = 1$ SUSY QM with a cubic superpotential, we obtain tight bounds that agree well with available approximation methods. At weak coupling they match well with the semiclassical instanton contribution to SUSY-breaking ground-state energy, while at strong coupling they exhibit the expected scaling and match well with Hamiltonian truncation.
  For the SUSY matrix QM, we construct a $44 \times 44$ bootstrap matrix and obtain bounds at large $N$. At strong coupling, we obtain the expected $E \sim \kappa \ g^{2/3}$ scaling of $E$ with $g$ and extract a lower bound on the coefficient $\kappa &gt; .196$. At small coupling, the theory has a critical point $g_c$ where the two wells merge into one. We find a spurious kink at $g = \sqrt{2} g_c$. We attribute this to truncation error and solver limitations, and discuss possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Group Representations of Lorentz Transformations Extended to Superluminal Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group that includes space-time transformations for observers moving with superluminal relative velocities in arbitrary direction. This extension is generated by a realization of the Klein four group depending on polar and azimuthal angles identifying a spatial direction and is obtained with matrices representing infinite velocity limits of superluminal Lorentz boosts. The resulting group has the same identity component of the whole Lorentz group O(3,1) but involutive operators corresponding to an infinite speed boost and its negative in place of parity and time reversal. Different spatial directions in the definition of Klein group realization give rise to equivalent group extensions. We then define the extended Poincare group including translations and classify its unitary irreducible representations (UIRs). The resulting UIRs are induced from Wigner's UIRs of standard Poincare group and depend on the action of the extended Lorentz group defined on momentum space. UIRs corresponding to non lightlike orbits restrict to the ordinary Poincare subgroup as a multiplicity one direct sum of a massive forward, a massive backward and a tachyonic Wigner UIR while for lightlike orbits as two inequivalent direct sum representations combiningh linearly a forward and backward massless Wigner UIR. We then derive wave equations corresponding to solutions of the Casimir eigenvalue problem of Poincare algebra obtained differentiating the above representations. This set of equations contains all the wave equations known to date in quantum field theory together with new wave equations describing tachyonic behaviour and a new class of massless representations. We finally show that tachyonic wave functions provide a relevant representation theoretic tool for interpretation of parity violation phenomena in quantum field theory</description>

      <title>The Geometric Origin of Time's Arrow: Loschmidt Resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox-the 150-year-old contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution. The resolution requires both quantum mechanics and classical chaos; neither alone suffices. Quantum uncertainty without chaos produces slow, polynomial spreading-not fundamentally irreversible. Classical chaos without quantum uncertainty produces computational intractability-trajectories diverge exponentially, yet the system remains on one trajectory, reversible in principle with sufficient precision. Only together do they produce geometric impossibility: chaos exponentially amplifies irreducible $\hbar$-scale uncertainty until stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution, rendering time-reversed trajectories physically inaccessible despite being mathematically valid and equiprobable. Information is never destroyed-it becomes geometrically inaccessible. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate is identical in both time directions, preserving microscopic symmetry while explaining macroscopic irreversibility. Three decades of Loschmidt echo experiments confirm perturbation-independent decay consistent with geometric inaccessibility. The framework unifies thermodynamic, quantum, and information-theoretic arrows of time.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped onto the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, by using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it unclear how quantum annealing outperforms thermal annealing in which problem instances. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar, but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.</description>

      <title>A Platform for Evanescently Trapping Rb-87 Using Silicon Nitride Strip Waveguides Buried in Silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems. In leveraging the miniaturisation possible through photonic integrated circuits, cold-atom sensors would be able to reach much wider commercial adoption. In this paper, we introduce a platform for evanescently trapping 87Rb using strip silicon nitride waveguides buried in silica using red- and blue-detuned fundamental and higher-order modes, providing a three-dimensional adjustable trap for BEC-based, chip-scale work in quantum science and technologies.</description>
