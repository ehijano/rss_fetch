      <title>Dependence and Independence for Reversible Process Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To refine formal methods for concurrent systems, there are several ways of enriching classical operational semantics of process calculi. One can enable the auditing and undoing of past synchronisations thanks to communication keys, thus easing the study of true concurrency as a by-product. Alternatively, proof labels embed information about the origins of actions in transition labels, facilitating syntactic analysis. Enriching proof labels with keys enables a theory of the relations on transitions and on events based on their labels only. We offer for the first time separate definitions of dependence relation and independence relation, and prove their complementarity on connected transitions instead of postulating it. Leveraging the recent axiomatic approach to reversibility, we prove the canonicity of these relations and provide additional tools to study the relationships between e.g., concurrency and causality on transitions and events. Finally, we make precise the subtle relationship between bisimulations based on both forward and backward transitions, on key ordering, and on dependency preservation, providing a direct definition of History Preserving bisimulation for CCS.</description>

      <title>Abstracting Situation Calculus Action Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for agent abstraction based on the situation calculus and the ConGolog agent programming language. We assume that we have a high-level specification and a low-level specification of the agent, both represented as basic action theories. A refinement mapping specifies how each high-level action is implemented by a low-level ConGolog program and how each high-level fluent can be translated into a low-level formula. We define a notion of sound abstraction between such action theories in terms of the existence of a suitable bisimulation between their respective models. Sound abstractions have many useful properties that ensure that we can reason about the agent's actions (e.g., executability, projection, and planning) at the abstract level, and refine and concretely execute them at the low level. We also characterize the notion of complete abstraction where all actions (including exogenous ones) that the high level thinks can happen can in fact occur at the low level. To facilitate verifying that one has a sound/complete abstraction relative to a mapping, we provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions. Finally, we identify a set of basic action theory constraints that ensure that for any low-level action sequence, there is a unique high-level action sequence that it refines. This allows us to track/monitor what the low-level agent is doing and describe it in abstract terms (i.e., provide high-level explanations, for instance, to a client or manager).</description>

      <title>Brownian Motion in Isabelle/HOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to formally verify robotic controllers, we must tackle the inherent uncertainty of sensing and actuation in a physical environment. We can model uncertainty using stochastic hybrid systems, which combine discrete jumps with continuous, stochastic behaviour. The verification of these systems is intractable for state-exploration based approaches, so we instead propose a deductive verification approach. As a first step towards a deductive verification tool, we present a mechanisation of Brownian motion within Isabelle/HOL. For this, we mechanise stochastic kernels and Markov semigroups, which allow us to specify a range of processes with stationary, independent increments. Further, we prove the Kolmogorov-Chentsov theorem, which allows us to construct H\"older continuous modifications of processes that satisfy certain bounds on their expectation. This paves the way for modelling and verifying stochastic hybrid systems in Isabelle/HOL.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries have been exploited successfully within the realms of SAT and QBF to improve solver performance in practical applications and to devise more powerful proof systems. As a first step towards extending these advancements to the class of dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBFs), which generalize QBF by allowing more nuanced variable dependencies, this work develops a comprehensive theory to characterize symmetries for DQBFs. We also introduce the notion of symmetry breakers of DQBFs, along with a concrete construction, and discuss how to detect DQBF symmetries algorithmically using a graph-based approach.</description>

      <title>A positional $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_3$-complete objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study zero-sum turn-based games on graphs. In this note, we show the existence of a game objective that is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_3$-complete for the Borel hierarchy and that is positional, i.e., for which positional strategies suffice for the first player to win over arenas of arbitrary cardinality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known such objective; all previously known positional objectives are in $\mathbf{\Sigma}^0_3$. The objective in question is a qualitative variant of the well-studied total-payoff objective, where the goal is to maximise the sum of weights.</description>

      <title>The Representation of Meaningful Precision, and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concepts of precision, and accuracy are domain and problem dependent. The simplified numeric hard and soft measures used in the fields of statistical learning, many types of machine learning, and binary or multiclass classification problems are known to be of limited use for understanding the meaningfulness of models or their relevance. Arguably, they are neither of patterns nor proofs. Further, there are no good measures or representations for analogous concepts in the cognition domain. In this research, the key issues are reflected upon, and a compositional knowledge representation approach in a minimalist general rough framework is proposed for the problem contexts. The latter is general enough to cover most application contexts, and may be applicable in the light of improved computational tools available.</description>

      <title>Self-Satisfied: An end-to-end framework for SAT generation and prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem asks whether there exists an assignment of boolean values to the variables of an arbitrary boolean formula making the formula evaluate to True. It is well-known that all NP-problems can be coded as SAT problems and therefore SAT is important both practically and theoretically. From both of these perspectives, better understanding the patterns and structure implicit in SAT data is of significant value. In this paper, we describe several advances that we believe will help open the door to such understanding: we introduce hardware accelerated algorithms for fast SAT problem generation, a geometric SAT encoding that enables the use of transformer architectures typically applied to vision tasks, and a simple yet effective technique we term head slicing for reducing sequence length representation inside transformer architectures. These advances allow us to scale our approach to SAT problems with thousands of variables and tens of thousands of clauses. We validate our architecture, termed Satisfiability Transformer (SaT), on the SAT prediction task with data from the SAT Competition (SATComp) 2022 problem sets. Prior related work either leveraged a pure machine learning approach, but could not handle SATComp-sized problems, or was hybrid in the sense of integrating a machine learning component in a standard SAT solving tool. Our pure machine learning approach achieves prediction accuracies comparable to recent work, but on problems that are an order of magnitude larger than previously demonstrated. A fundamental aspect of our work concerns the very nature of SAT data and its suitability for training machine learning models. We both describe experimental results that probe the landscape of where SAT data can be successfully used for learning and position these results within the broader context of complexity and learning.</description>

      <title>Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanized verification of liveness properties for programs with effects, nondeterminism, and nontermination is difficult. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate on the level of models (traces, automata) not executable code, creating a verification gap and losing the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics. Reasoning about infinite traces and automata requires complex (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., guardedness checker). We propose a structural approach to the verification of temporal properties with a new temporal logic that we call ictl. Using ictl, we internalize complex (co-)inductive proof techniques to structural lemmas and reasoning about variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform mechanized proofs of general temporal properties, while working in a high-level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of ictl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with queues, secure memory, and distributed consensus.</description>

      <title>MedLogic-AQA: Enhancing Medical Question Answering with Abstractive Models Focusing on Logical Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Medical question-answering (QA) tasks, the need for effective systems is pivotal in delivering accurate responses to intricate medical queries. However, existing approaches often struggle to grasp the intricate logical structures and relationships inherent in medical contexts, thus limiting their capacity to furnish precise and nuanced answers. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel Abstractive QA system MedLogic-AQA that harnesses First Order Logic (FOL) based rules extracted from both context and questions to generate well-grounded answers. Through initial experimentation, we identified six pertinent first-order logical rules, which were then used to train a Logic-Understanding (LU) model capable of generating logical triples for a given context, question, and answer. These logic triples are then integrated into the training of MedLogic-AQA, enabling effective and coherent reasoning during answer generation. This distinctive fusion of logical reasoning with abstractive QA equips our system to produce answers that are logically sound, relevant, and engaging. Evaluation with respect to both automated and human-based demonstrates the robustness of MedLogic-AQA against strong baselines. Through empirical assessments and case studies, we validate the efficacy of MedLogic-AQA in elevating the quality and comprehensiveness of answers in terms of reasoning as well as informativeness</description>

      <title>Solovay reducibility via translation functions on rationals and on reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solovay reducibility $\redsolovay$ was introduced by Robert M. Solovay in 1975 via translation functions on rationals. In 2022, its totalized version $\redsolovaytotal$ (i.e., Solovay reducibility via a total function on rationals) has been examined by Merkle and Titov (arXiv:2407.14869).
  In 2020, Kumabe, Miyabe, Mizusawa and Suzuki (arXiv:1903.08625) have discovered that Solovay reducibility can be characterized on left-c.e.\ reals using the notion of a translation function on reals. In 2024, Kumabe, Miyabe, and Suzuki (DOI: 10.3233/COM-230486) have introduced a new reducibility $\redclopen$ on all reals, that uses the notion of a translation function on reals, and its totalized version $\redcllocal$. %They have also shown that $\redcllocal$ implies $\redclopen$, wherein the converse is not true even for left-c.e. reals.
  In this work, we show that $\redsolovayreal$ implies $\redclopen$ and $\redsolovaytotal$ implies $\redcllocal$ on all reals.</description>

      <title>The Arithmetical Hierarchy: A Realizability-Theoretic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the arithmetical hierarchy from the perspective of realizability theory. An experimental observation in classical computability theory is that the notion of degrees of unsolvability for natural arithmetical decision problems only plays a role in counting the number of quantifiers, jumps, or mind-changes. In contrast, we reveal that when the realizability interpretation is combined with many-one reducibility, it becomes possible to classify natural arithmetical problems in a very nontrivial way.</description>

      <title>On The Axioms Of $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adhesive and quasiadhesive categories provide a general framework for the study of algebraic graph rewriting systems. In a quasiadhesive category any two regular subobjects have a join which is again a regular subobject. Vice versa, if regular monos are adhesive, then the existence of a regular join for any pair of regular subobjects entails quasiadhesivity. It is also known (quasi)adhesive categories can be embedded in a Grothendieck topos via a functor preserving pullbacks and pushouts along (regular) monomorphisms. In this paper we extend these results to $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesive categories, a concept recently introduced to generalize the notion of (quasi)adhesivity. We introduce the notion of $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphism, which allows us to express $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesivity as a condition on the subobjects's posets. Moreover, $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphisms allows us to show how an $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-adhesive category can be embedded into a Grothendieck topos, preserving pullbacks and $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-pushouts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Polynomial Lawvere logic PL, a logic defined over the Lawvere quantale of extended positive reals with sum as tensor, to which we add multiplication, thereby obtaining a semiring structure. PL is designed for complex quantitative reasoning, allowing judgements that express inequalities between polynomials on the extended positive reals. We introduce a deduction system and demonstrate its expressiveness by deriving a classical result from probability theory relating the Kantorovich and the total variation distances. Although the deductive system is not complete in general, we achieve completeness for finitely axiomatizable theories. The proof of completeness relies on the Krivine-Stengle Positivstellensatz (a variant of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz). Additionally, we provide new complexity results, both for PL and its affine fragment AL, regarding two decision problems: satisfiability of a set of judgements and semantical consequence from a set of judgements. The former is NP-complete in AL and in PSPACE for PL; the latter is co-NP complete in PL and in PSPACE for PL.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new theory of strong subalgebras and linear congruences that are defined globally. Using this theory we provide a new proof of the correctness of Zhuk's algorithm for all tractable CSPs on a finite domain, and therefore a new simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture. Additionally, using the new theory we prove that composing a weak near-unanimity operation of an odd arity $n$ we can derive an $n$-ary operation that is symmetric on all two-element sets. Thus, CSP over a constraint language $\Gamma$ on a finite domain is tractable if and only if there exist infinitely many polymorphisms of $\Gamma$ that are symmetric on all two-element sets.</description>

Abstract: The Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is the problem of evaluating a sentence with both quantifiers, over relations from some constraint language, with conjunction as the only connective. We show that for any constraint language on a finite domain the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is either in $\Pi_{2}^{P}$, or PSpace-complete. Additionally, we build a constraint language on a 6-element domain such that the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem over this language is $\Pi_{2}^{P}$-complete.</description>

Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</description>
