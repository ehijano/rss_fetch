      <title>Graded embeddings, root generated subalgebras and $\pi$-systems for quasisimple Kac-Moody superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a construction of Gorelik and Shaviv, we show that the real roots of a root generated subalgebra associated with a $\pi$-system contained in the positive roots are obtained by successive applications of even and odd reflections to the $\pi$-system, and that they form a real closed subroot system. Using this result, we establish an analogue of Dynkins bijection in the setting of symmetrizable quasisimple Kac-Moody superalgebras. In addition, we obtain several results on root strings in the super setting, analogous to those of Billig and Pianzola, and show that graded embeddings arise as root generated subalgebras associated with linearly independent $\pi$-systems.</description>

      <title>On Lie-holomorphs of Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the notion of the Lie-holomorph of a Leibniz algebra, recently introduced by N. P. Souris as a generalisation of the classical holomorph construction for Lie algebras. We establish a connection between the Lie-holomorph construction and the Leibniz algebra of biderivations defined by J.-L. Loday, and we prove that a linear endomorphism is a Lie-derivation if and only if it is simultaneously a derivation and an anti-derivation. As an application, we classify the Lie-holomorph algebras of all low-dimensional non-Lie Leibniz algebras over a field of characteristic different from $2$.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Defining Cochain Complexes for dual Leibniz algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a cochain map embedding the cohomology complex of any dual Leibniz algebra $B$ into the Lie algebra cochain complex of $\mathfrak{g} \otimes B$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a Leibniz algebra. This reduces the study of dual Leibniz cohomology to classical Lie algebra cohomology, yielding computational simplifications and new structural insights.</description>

      <title>Tensor products of Lie nilpotent associative algebras and applications to codimension sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ and $H$ be unital associative algebras over a field $K$, such that $G$ satisfies the identity $[x_1, \dots, x_p] = 0$ for some integer $p \geq 3$ and $H$ satisfies the identities $[x_1, x_2, x_3] = 0$ and $[x_1, x_2] \cdots [x_{2k-1}, x_{2k}]=0$ for some $k \geq 2$. In this paper, extending results of Deryabina and Krasilnikov, we show that the tensor product $G \otimes H$ is again a Lie nilpotent associative algebra, i.e., it satisfies $[x_1, \dots, x_{q}] = 0$ for some $q \geq p$. We also determine an explicit value of $q$ in the case $k = 2$, i.e., when $H$ satisfies the identity $[x_1, x_2][x_3, x_4] = 0$. As a corollary, we reprove a result of Drensky saying that any product of Grassmann algebras of the form $E\otimes E_{i_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes E_{i_s}$ or $E_{j_1} \otimes E_{j_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes E_{j_t}$, where $E$ denotes the Grassmann algebra over a countable dimensional vector space and $E_r$ denotes the Grasmann algebra over an $r$-dimensional vector space, satisfies an identity of the form $[x_1, \dots, x_q] = 0$ for some integer $q \geq 3$. In addition, we show that for products of the form $E\otimes E_{i_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes E_{i_s}$ the minimal value of $q$ is always and odd integer. We also provide several particular cases in which a value of $q$ can be explicitly computed. As an application, we consider a field of characteristic zero, the variety $\mathfrak{N}_p$ of Lie nilpotent associative algebras of index at most $p$ and the corresponding relatively free algebras of finite rank, $F_n(\mathfrak{N}_p)$. We exhibit many explicit irreducible $S_n$-modules in the $S_n$-module decomposition of the space of proper multilinear polynomials in $F_n(\mathfrak{N}_p)$ for any $p$. This gives a lower bound for the dimensions of the spaces of multilinear and proper multilinear polynomials in $F_n(\mathfrak{N}_p)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we initiate the study of quivers satisfying quantum Yang-Baxter equation. By considering quivers with quantum group like relations such as quantum Yang-Baxter equation, Hecke condition, we follow RTT construction to produce examples of Leavitt path algebras that contain quantum matrix algebra as subalgebra. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers.</description>

      <title>Structure and Symmetry of Sally Type Semigroup Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a numerical semigroup minimally generated by a subset of the interval $[e,2e-1]$ with multiplicity $e$ and width $e-1$. Such numerical semigroups are called Sally type semigroups. We show that the defining ideals of these semigroup rings, when the embedding dimension is $e-2$, generically have the structure of the sum of two determinantal ideals. More generally, Sally type numerical semigroups with multiplicity $e$ and embedding dimension $d=e-k$ are obtained by introducing $k$ gaps in the interval $[e,2e-1]$. It is known that for $k =2$, there is precisely one such semigroup that is Gorenstein, and it happens when one deletes consecutive integers. Let $S^e_k(j)$ denote the Sally type numerical semigroup of multiplcity $e$, embedding dimension $e-k$ obtained by deleting the $k$ consecutive integers $j, j+1, \ldots, j+k-1$.We prove that for any $1\le k &lt; e/2$, the semigroup $S^e_k(j)$ is Gorenstein if and only if $j=k$. We construct an explicit minimal free resolution of the semigroup ring of $S^e_k(k)$ and compute the Betti numbers. In general, we characterize when $S^e_k(j)$ are symmetric and construct minimal resolutions for these Gorenstein semigroups rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $SL_2$-tiling is a bi-infinite matrix in which all adjacent $2 \times 2$ minors are equal to $1$. Positive integral $SL_2$-tilings were introduced by Assem, Reutenauer and Smith as generalisations of classical Conway--Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that positive integral $SL_2$-tilings with translational symmetry are in bijection with triangulations of annuli. We use this correspondence to study the properties of periodic positive integral $SL_2$-tilings.</description>

      <title>Merge on workspaces as Hopf algebra Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical properties of a Hopf algebra Markov chain with state space the binary rooted forests with labelled leaves. This Markovian dynamical system describes the core computational process of structure formation and transformation in syntax via the Merge operation, according to Chomsky's Minimalism model of generative linguistics. The dynamics decomposes into an ergodic dynamical system with uniform stationary distribution, given by the action of Internal Merge, while the contributions of External Merge and (a minimal form of) Sideward Merge reduce to a simpler Markov chain with state space the set of partitions and with combinatorial weights. The Sideward Merge part of the dynamics prevents convergence to fully formed connected structures (trees), unless the different forms of Merge are weighted by a cost function, as predicted by linguistic theory. Results on the asymptotic behavior of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and eigenvector in this weighted case, obtained in terms of an associated Perron-Frobenius problem in the tropical semiring, show that the usual cost functions (Minimal Search and Resource Restrictions) proposed in the linguistic literature do not suffice to obtain convergence to the tree structures, while an additional optimization property based on the Shannon entropy achieves the expected result for the dynamics. We also comment on the introduction of continuous parameters related to semantic embedding and other computational models, and also on some filtering of the dynamics by coloring rules that model the linguistic filtering by theta roles and phase structure, and on parametric variation and the process of parameter setting in Externalization.</description>

      <title>Schurian-finiteness of blocks of type B Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schurian-finiteness, also known as $\tau$-tilting finiteness, is equivalent to the finiteness of various representation theoretic objects such as wide subcategories. The first three authors classified Schurian-finite blocks of type A Hecke algebras in [ALS23]. Here we study the Schurian-finiteness of blocks of type B Hecke algebras, and determine the Schurian-finiteness of all blocks if the Hecke algebra is `non-integral', and for almost all blocks in the integral case. The only remaining cases are a small number of blocks in defect $3$ when $e=3$, and a family of blocks in defects $3$ and $4$ for $e\geqslant4$. The classification is mostly achieved by methods using decomposition numbers, with many degenerate cases requiring direct study using standard methods from the representation theory of quivers.</description>

      <title>Quantum upper triangular matrix algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the ideas in~\cite{yM88} and some inspiration from~\cite{KO24}, we construct a bialgebra $T_q(n)$ and a pointed Hopf algebra $UT_q(n)$ which quantize the coordinate rings of the algebra of upper triangular matrices and of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices of size $n\geq 2$, respectively, where $q$ is a nonzero parameter. The resulting structure on $UT_q(n)$ is neither commutative nor cocommutative, so we obtain a quantum group. The motivation comes from the idea of quantizing the incidence algebra of a finite poset, as the latter can be embedded as a subalgebra of the algebra of upper triangular matrices. After defining the bialgebra $T_q(n)$ and the Hopf algebra $UT_q(n)$, we study and compare their Lie algebras of derivations, their automorphism groups and their low degree Hochschild cohomology, in case $n=2$.</description>

Abstract: We define and derive basic properties of the notion of Rota-Baxter operator on anti-flexible algebra. Starting from a Rota-Baxter operator on an anti-flexible algebra, we construct pre-anti-flexible algebra structure and associated left(right)-symmetric algebra as well. The notion of O-operator on anti-flexible algebra is recalled and used to build left(right)- symmetric algebra as well as related properties. Furthermore, we introduce Nijenhuis anti-flexible algebra and derive associated properties. Nijenhuis operator on anti-flexible algebra is used to build pre-anti-flexible algebra structure and related left(right)-symmetric algebra.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative invariants of finite and classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the invariant subring of the tensor algebra $T(W)$ of a $G$-representation $W$, viewed as a twisted commutative algebra (tca). For a faithful representation $W$ of a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, we show that if char$(k) \mid \#G$, then $T(W)^G$ is not finitely generated as a tca. In contrast, for a representation $W$ of a classical group $G_{\mathbb{Z}}$, we prove that the invariant subring $T(W_k)^{G_k}$ is finitely generated as a tca when $k$ is algebraically closed of sufficiently large characteristic, provided that $W$ admits a good filtration over $\mathbb{Z}$. Finally, we introduce a categorical variant of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension and compute its value to be $\binom{n+1}{2}$ for $T(\mathbb{C}^n)$ as a tca. Our key insight is to use the Schur functor to reduce questions about noncommutative invariants to those concerning vector invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate commutative analogues of Clifford algebras -- algebras whose generators square to $\pm1$ but commute, instead of anti-commuting as they do in Clifford algebras. We observe that commutativity allows for elegant results. We note that these algebras generalise multicomplex spaces -- we show that a commutative analogue of Clifford algebra is either isomorphic to a multicomplex space or to `multi split-complex space' (space defined just like multicomplex numbers but uses split-complex numbers instead of complex numbers). We do a general study of commutative analogues of Clifford algebras and use tools like operations of conjugation and idempotents to give a tensor product decomposition and a direct sum decomposition for them. Tensor product decomposition follows relatively easily from the definition. For the direct sum decomposition, we give explicit basis using new techniques.</description>

      <title>The Dixmier problem for skew PBW extensions and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09285v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss for skew $PBW$ extensions the famous Dixmier problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier in 1968. The skew $PBW$ extensions are noncommutative rings of polynomial type and covers several algebras and rings arising in mathematical physics and noncommutative algebraic geometry. For this purpose, we introduce the Dixmier algebras and we will study the Dixmier problem for algebras over commutative rings, in particular, for $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras, i.e., for arbitrary rings. The results are focused on the investigation of the Dixmier problem for matrix algebras, product of algebras, tensor product of algebras and also on the Dixmier question for the following particular key skew $PBW$ extension: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ be the $K$-algebra generated by $n\geq 2$ elements $x_1,\dots,x_n$ subject to relations
  $$x_jx_i=x_ix_j+d_{ij}, \ for \ all \ 1\leq i&lt;j\leq n, \ with \ d_{ij}\in K-\{0\}$$.
  We prove that the algebra $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is central and simple. In the last section we present a matrix-computational approach to the problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier and also we compute some concrete nontrivial examples of automorphisms of the first Weyl algebra $A_1(K)$ and $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ using the MAPLE library SPBWE developed for the first author. We compute the inverses of these automorphisms, and for $A_1(K)$, its factorization through some elementary automorphisms. For $n$ odd, we found some endomorphisms of $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ that are not automorphisms. We conjecture that $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is Dixmier when $n$ is even.</description>

Abstract: Given k similarity classes of invertible matrices, the Deligne-Simpson problem asks to determine whether or not one can find matrices in these classes whose product is the identity and with no common invariant subspace. The first author conjectured an answer in terms of an associated root system, and proved one implication in joint work with Shaw. In this paper we prove the other implication, thus confirming the conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Jordan canonical form of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of a matrix function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Given a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{F}^{n \times n}$ and a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}[w]$, we determine the Jordan canonical form of the formal Fr\'{e}chet derivative of $f(A)$, in terms of that of $A$ and of $f$. When $\mathbb{F}\subseteq \mathbb{C}$, via Hermite interpolation, our result provides a solution to [N.J. Higham, \emph{Functions of Matrices: Theory and Computation}, Research Problem 3.11]. A generalization consists of finding the Jordan canonical form of linear combinations of Kronecker products of powers of two square matrices, i.e., $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} (X^i \otimes Y^j)$. For this generalization, we provide some new partial results, including a partial solution under certain assumptions and general bounds on the number and the sizes of Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>Embedding $K$-algebras into Leavitt algebra $L_K(1, 2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the commutative monoid $T = (\{0, 1\}, \vee)$ is a weak terminal object in the category of conical monoids with order units, there is a unital homomorphism from every Bergman $K$-algebra corresponding to a conical finitely generated commutative monoid into the Leavitt algebra $L_K(1,2)$, where $K$ is a field. This fact will be used to give a short proof that Leavitt path algebras associated with finite graphs with condition $(L)$ embed into $L_K(1,2)$, as well as provide criteria for an embedding of $M_s(L_{K}(1, m))$ in $M_s(L_{K}(1, n))$. As our second main result, we show that the Heisenberg equation $xy-yx=1$ cannot be realized in any Steinberg algebra, implying that the first Weyl algebra cannot be embedded into $L_K(1,2)$, giving an affirmative answer to a question of Brownlowe and Sorensen on the embeddability of $K$-algebras with a countable basis inside $L_K(1,2)$. Whereas, $L_K(E)$ cannot be graded-embedded into $L_K(1,2)$ in general, in the final section we show that $L_K(E)$ does admit a graded embedding into $L_K(1,2)\otimes_K L_K(1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Locally finitely presented Grothendieck categories with a flat generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects also has enough projectives. In this paper, we start from a key observation: a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has exact products. This enables several equivalent reformulations of the problem, allowing us to identify a counterexample (thus providing a negative solution to the problem), while also connecting it to a classical ring-theoretical question posed by Miller in 1975, and even to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Moreover, we describe several classes of Grothendieck categories where the problem can be answered affirmatively. For example, we show that a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose category of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flats if, and only if, it is generated by a family of finitely generated projectives.</description>

      <title>Silting correspondences and Calabi-Yau dg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying two important classes of objects in triangulated categories; silting objects and $d$-cluster tilting objects, and their correspondences. First, we introduce the notion of $d$-silting objects as a generalization tilting objects whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension at most $d$. For a smooth dg algebra $A$ and its $(d+1)$-Calabi-Yau completion $\Pi$, we show that the induction functor gives an embedding from the poset $\operatorname{silt}^dA$ of $d$-silting objects of $A$ to the poset $\operatorname{silt}\Pi$ of silting objects of $\Pi$. Moreover, when $H^0\Pi$ is finite dimensional, this functor identifies the Hasse quiver of $\operatorname{silt}^dA$ as a full subquiver of the Hasse quiver of $\operatorname{silt}\Pi$. In this case, we also prove that each $d$-silting object $P$ of $A$ gives a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of $\operatorname{per} A$ as the $\nu[-d]$-orbit of $P$. Secondly, for a connective Calabi-Yau dg algebra $\Pi$, we study the map from $\operatorname{silt}\Pi$ to the set $d\text{-}\operatorname{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ of $d$-cluster tilting objects in the cluster category $\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$. We call $\Pi$ $\mathcal{F}$-liftable if the induced map $\operatorname{silt}\Pi\cap\mathcal{F}\to d\text{-}\operatorname{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is bijective, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the fundamental domain in $\operatorname{per}\Pi$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$-liftable Calabi-Yau dg algebras $\Pi$ such that $H^0\Pi$ is hereditary are precisely the Calabi-Yau completions of hereditary algebras. As an application, we obtain counter-examples to an open question posed in [IYa1]. We also study Calabi-Yau dg algebras such that the map $\operatorname{silt}\Pi\to d\text{-}\operatorname{ctilt}\mathcal{C}(\Pi)$ is surjective, which we call liftable. We explain our results by polynomial dg algebras and Calabi-Yau completions of type $A_2$.</description>

      <title>Reductive monoids and cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the coordinate ring of the Vinberg monoid of a simply connected semisimple complex group is an upper cluster algebra. As an application, we construct cluster structures on a large class of flat reductive monoids. After localization, we obtain cluster structures on any connected reductive group whose commutator group is simply connected.</description>
