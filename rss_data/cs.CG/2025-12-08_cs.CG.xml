      <title>On Planar Straight-Line Dominance Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following question, which has been considered since the 90's: Does every $st$-planar graph admit a planar straight-line dominance drawing? We show concrete evidence for the difficulty of this question, by proving that, unlike upward planar straight-line drawings, planar straight-line dominance drawings with prescribed $y$-coordinates do not always exist and planar straight-line dominance drawings cannot always be constructed via a contract-draw-expand inductive approach. We also show several classes of $st$-planar graphs that always admit a planar straight-line dominance drawing. These include $st$-planar $3$-trees in which every stacking operation introduces two edges incoming into the new vertex, $st$-planar graphs in which every vertex is adjacent to the sink, $st$-planar graphs in which no face has the left boundary that is a single edge, and $st$-planar graphs that have a leveling with span at most two.</description>

      <title>On Sparse Representations of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3-manifolds are commonly represented as triangulations, consisting of abstract tetrahedra whose triangular faces are identified in pairs. The combinatorial sparsity of a triangulation, as measured by the treewidth of its dual graph, plays a fundamental role in the design of parameterized algorithms. In this work, we investigate algorithmic procedures that transform or modify a given triangulation while controlling specific sparsity parameters. First, we describe a linear-time algorithm that converts a given triangulation into a Heegaard diagram of the underlying 3-manifold, showing that the construction preserves treewidth. We apply this construction to exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable framework for computing Kuperberg's quantum invariants of 3-manifolds. Second, we present a quasi-linear-time algorithm that retriangulates a given triangulation into one with maximum edge valence of at most nine, while only moderately increasing the treewidth of the dual graph. Combining these two algorithms yields a quasi-linear-time algorithm that produces, from a given triangulation, a Heegaard diagram in which every attaching curve intersects at most nine others.</description>

      <title>Persistent Laplacian Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vectorization methods for \emph{Persistent Homology} (PH), such as the \emph{Persistence Image} (PI), encode persistence diagrams into finite dimensional vector spaces while preserving stability. In parallel, the \emph{Persistent Laplacian} (PL) has been proposed, whose spectra contain the information of PH as well as richer geometric and combinatorial features. In this work, we develop an analogous vectorization for PL. We introduce \emph{signatures} that map PL to real values and assemble these into a \emph{Persistent Laplacian Diagram} (PLD) and a \emph{Persistent Laplacian Image} (PLI). We prove the stability of PLI under the noise on PD. Furthermore, we illustrate the resulting framework on explicit graph examples that are indistinguishable by both PH and a signature of the combinatorial Laplacian but are separated by the signature of PL.</description>
