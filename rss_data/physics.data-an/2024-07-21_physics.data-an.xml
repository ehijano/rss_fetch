      <title>EggNet: An Evolving Graph-based Graph Attention Network for Particle Track Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Track reconstruction is a crucial task in particle experiments and is traditionally very computationally expensive due to its combinatorial nature. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach that can improve scalability. Most of these GNN-based methods, including the edge classification (EC) and the object condensation (OC) approach, require an input graph that needs to be constructed beforehand. In this work, we consider a one-shot OC approach that reconstructs particle tracks directly from a set of hits (point cloud) by recursively applying graph attention networks with an evolving graph structure. This approach iteratively updates the graphs and can better facilitate the message passing across each graph. Preliminary studies on the TrackML dataset show better track performance compared to the methods that require a fixed input graph.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background contributing sources, and thus is not a clean measure of the CME.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis on Block Time Distributions in Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some blockchain networks employ a distributed consensus algorithm featuring Byzantine fault tolerance. Notably, certain public chains, such as Cosmos and Tezos, which operate on a proof-of-stake mechanism, have adopted this algorithm. While it is commonly assumed that these blockchains maintain a nearly constant block creation time, empirical analysis reveals fluctuations in this interval; this phenomenon has received limited attention. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to account for the processes of block propagation and validation within Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus blockchains, aiming to theoretically analyze the probability distribution of block time. First, we propose stochastic processes governing the broadcasting communications among validator nodes. Consequently, we theoretically demonstrate that the probability distribution of broadcast time among validator nodes adheres to the Gumbel distribution. This finding indicates that the distribution of block time typically arises from convolving multiple Gumbel distributions. Additionally, we derive an approximate formula for the block time distribution suitable for data analysis purposes. By fitting this approximation to real-world block time data, we demonstrate the consistent estimation of block time distribution parameters.</description>

      <title>Fast Identification of Transients: Applying Expectation Maximization to Neutrino Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as Expectation Maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>
