      <title>Normalization and selecting non-differentially expressed genes improve machine learning modelling of cross-platform transcriptomic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalization is a critical step in quantitative analyses of biological processes. Recent works show that cross-platform integration and normalization enable machine learning (ML) training on RNA microarray and RNA-seq data, but no independent datasets were used in their studies. Therefore, it is unclear how to improve ML modelling performance on independent RNA array and RNA-seq based datasets. Inspired by the house-keeping genes that are commonly used in experimental biology, this study tests the hypothesis that non-differentially expressed genes (NDEG) may improve normalization of transcriptomic data and subsequently cross-platform modelling performance of ML models. Microarray and RNA-seq datasets of the TCGA breast cancer were used as independent training and test datasets, respectively, to classify the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. NDEG (p&gt;0.85) and differentially expressed genes (DEG, p&lt;0.05) were selected based on the p values of ANOVA analysis and used for subsequent data normalization and classification, respectively. Models trained based on data from one platform were used for testing on the other platform. Our data show that NDEG and DEG gene selection could effectively improve the model classification performance. Normalization methods based on parametric statistical analysis were inferior to those based on nonparametric statistics. In this study, the LOG_QN and LOG_QNZ normalization methods combined with the neural network classification model seem to achieve better performance. Therefore, NDEG-based normalization appears useful for cross-platform testing on completely independent datasets. However, more studies are required to examine whether NDEG-based normalization can improve ML classification performance in other datasets and other omic data types.</description>

      <title>Cross-modality Matching and Prediction of Perturbation Responses with Labeled Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is now possible to conduct large scale perturbation screens with complex readout modalities, such as different molecular profiles or high content cell images. While these open the way for systematic dissection of causal cell circuits, integrated such data across screens to maximize our ability to predict circuits poses substantial computational challenges, which have not been addressed. Here, we extend two Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport methods to incorporate the perturbation label for cross-modality alignment. The obtained alignment is then employed to train a predictive model that estimates cellular responses to perturbations observed with only one measurement modality. We validate our method for the tasks of cross-modality alignment and cross-modality prediction in a recent multi-modal single-cell perturbation dataset. Our approach opens the way to unified causal models of cell biology.</description>
