      <title>E. coli do not count single molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organisms must perform sensory-motor behaviors to survive. What bounds or constraints limit behavioral performance? Previously, we found that the gradient-climbing speed of a chemotaxing Escherichia coli is near a bound set by the limited information they acquire from their chemical environments. Here we ask what limits their sensory accuracy. Past theoretical analyses have shown that the stochasticity of single molecule arrivals sets a fundamental limit on the precision of chemical sensing. Although it has been argued that bacteria approach this limit, direct evidence is lacking. Here, using information theory and quantitative experiments, we find that E. coli's chemosensing is not limited by the physics of particle counting. First, we derive the physical limit on the behaviorally-relevant information that any sensor can get about a changing chemical concentration, assuming that every molecule arriving at the sensor is recorded. Then, we derive and measure how much information E. coli's signaling pathway encodes during chemotaxis. We find that E. coli encode two orders of magnitude less information than an ideal sensor limited only by shot noise in particle arrivals. These results strongly suggest that constraints other than particle arrival noise limit E. coli's sensory fidelity.</description>

      <title>The positioning of stress fibers in contractile cells minimizes internal mechanical stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanics of animal cells is strongly determined by stress fibers, which are contractile filament bundles that form dynamically in response to extracellular cues. Stress fibers allow the cell to adapt its mechanics to environmental conditions and to protect it from structural damage. While the physical description of single stress fibers is well-developed, much less is known about their spatial distribution on the level of whole cells. Here, we combine a finite element method for one-dimensional fibers embedded in an elastic bulk medium with dynamical rules for stress fiber formation based on genetic algorithms. We postulate that their main goal is to achieve minimal mechanical stress in the bulk material with as few fibers as possible. The fiber positions and configurations resulting from this optimization task alone are in good agreement with those found in experiments where cells in 3D-scaffolds were mechanically strained at one attachment point. For optimized configurations, we find that stress fibers typically run through the cell in a diagonal fashion, similar to reinforcement strategies used for composite material.</description>
