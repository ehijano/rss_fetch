      <title>Demonstration of an integral method for estimating wall shear stress in complex high-speed flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows over blunt bodies with distributed roughness present a class of problems relevant to hypersonic atmospheric entry systems. However, accurate predictions of shear stress on such bodies remains elusive. This work presents a simple integral formulation to infer wall shear stress based on the Favre-averaged streamwise momentum equation, integrated once in the wall-normal direction. The proposed integral formulation eliminates streamwise dependence, relying only on data and gradients extracted in the wall normal direction. Eight demonstration cases were selected to show the contributions of the various terms of the integral equation, the associated error in the estimate, and outline practical considerations when estimating the wall shear stress for complex flow conditions. In all cases, the error in the predicted shear stress compared to a more traditional approach was no more than 5%, with many cases having much lower error. Notably, the method was found to be viable even for surfaces in the transitionally rough and fully rough regimes by appropriate selection of a virtual origin, as well as flows over curved surfaces or with pressure gradients. Finally, the method produces acceptable estimates of shear stress even in the extreme condition when over 40% of the near-wall boundary layer data is absent. In brief, the present integral method is general and applicable to flows with curvature, surface roughness, and pressure gradients.</description>

      <title>A fourth order sharp immersed method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with stationary and moving boundaries and interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fourth order Navier-Stokes solver based on the immersed interface method (IIM), for flow problems with stationary and one-way coupled moving boundaries and interfaces. Our algorithm employs a Runge-Kutta-based projection method that maintains high-order temporal accuracy in both velocity and pressure for steady and unsteady velocity boundary conditions. Fourth order spatial accuracy is achieved through a novel fifth order IIM discretization scheme for the advection term, as well as existing high-order interface-corrected finite difference schemes for the other differential operators. Using a set of manufactured flow problems with stationary and moving boundaries, we demonstrate fourth order convergence of velocity and pressure in the infinity norm, both inside the domain and on the immersed boundaries. The solver's performance is further validated through a range of practical flow simulations, highlighting its efficiency over a second order scheme. Finally, we showcase the ability of our immersed discretization scheme to handle interface-coupled multiphysics problems by solving a conjugate heat transfer problem with multiple immersed solids. Overall, the proposed approach robustly combines the efficiency of high order discretization schemes with the flexibility of immersed discretizations for flow problems with complex, moving boundaries and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Mixed convection and onset of instability due to asymmetric wall heat fluxes in a porous channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of convective instability onset in a horizontal porous channel is explored. The channel's impermeable walls are heated with asymmetric thermal conditions modelled through unequal, but uniform, wall heat fluxes. A stationary solution describing the mixed convection flow is obtained from the governing local balance equations. Then, the linear instability of this flow is analysed by formulating an eigenvalue problem with normal modes. The research specifically highlights the role of the flow rate regime, parametrised through the P\'eclet number, where the Rayleigh number and the heat flux asymmetry ratio are key to defining when instability occurs. The numerical solution of the stability eigenvalue problem is achieved by employing the shooting method. Analytical results are also obtained by employing large-wavelength asymptotic expansions. A numerical analysis is performed to discuss the neutral stability curves and the critical values of the Rayleigh number under different flow and asymmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional blast waves in a rarefied polyatomic gas with large bulk viscosity based on rational extended thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional blast waves in a rarefied polyatomic gas with large bulk viscosity are studied based on rational extended thermodynamics (RET) with six independent fields: mass density, velocity, (equilibrium) pressure, and dynamic pressure. First, by using the method of Lie group theory, we derive a similarity solution of blast waves induced by an intense point explosion. We discuss the deviation from the well-known Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor solution due to the dynamic pressure. Second, we analyze the time evolution by numerically solving the field equations of the RET theory directly for both cases of the intense explosion corresponding to the similarity solution and moderately strong explosion with generic temperature dependence of the bulk viscosity. It is shown that the prediction by the RET theory shows quite different behaviors from those by the system of the Euler equations, and also the Navier-Stokes-Fourier theory when the relaxation time for the dynamic pressure is considerable.</description>

      <title>The Role of Vortex Stretching in Drag Reduction of Polymer-Laden Turbulent Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An addition of polymers can significantly reduce drag in wall-bounded turbulent flows, such as pipes or channels. This phenomenon is accompanied by a noticeable modification of the mean velocity profile. Starting from the premise that polymers reduce vortex-stretching, we derive a theoretical prediction for the mean-velocity profile. After assessing this prediction by numerical experiments of turbulence with reduced vortex stretching, we show that the theory successfully describes experimental measurements of drag-reduction in pipe-flow.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty Visualization Framework for Large-Scale Cardiovascular Flow Simulations: A Case Study on Aortic Stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalizable uncertainty quantification (UQ) and visualization framework for lattice Boltzmann method simulations of high Reynolds number vascular flows, demonstrated on a patient-specific stenosed aorta. The framework combines EasyVVUQ for parameter sampling with large-eddy simulation turbulence modeling in HemeLB, and executes ensembles on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. Spatially resolved metrics, including entropy and isosurface-crossing probability, are used to map uncertainty in pressure and wall shear stress fields directly onto vascular geometries. Two sources of model variability are examined: inlet peak velocity and the Smagorinsky constant. Inlet velocity variation produces high uncertainty downstream of the stenosis where turbulence develops, while upstream regions remain stable. Smagorinsky constant variation has little effect on the large-scale pressure field but increases WSS uncertainty in localized high-shear regions. In both cases, the stenotic throat manifests low entropy, indicative of robust identification of elevated WSS. By linking quantitative UQ measures to three-dimensional anatomy, the framework improves interpretability over conventional 1D UQ plots and supports clinically relevant decision-making, with broad applicability to vascular flow problems requiring both accuracy and spatial insight.</description>

      <title>Spray flamelet structures in a tubular counterflow configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, spray flamelet structures subject to curvature are systematically studied, emphasizing the ways in which this quantity modifies the budgets of the corresponding flamelet equations and their stretch-induced extinction limit. More specifically, a theoretical extension of the tubular counterflow configuration is first proposed, which allows the injection of droplets from the inner cylinder. After appropriate mathematical descriptions for this new configuration in physical and composition space are introduced, several ethanol/air tubular counterflow flames are studied. It is found that increasing curvature leads to major modifications of the resulting flamelet structures, which is attributable to its influence on the evaporation profiles. Further, it is found that increasing curvature considerably reduces the stretch-induced extinction limit, which can be directly related to a corresponding reduction of the maximum mixture fraction within the flamelet. Finally, it is concluded that extinction in tubular counterflow spray flames occurs through a mechanism significantly different from what has been previously observed for gas flamelets.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Incompatibility: Why Static Droplets Cannot Exist in Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static droplets serve as fundamental benchmarks for interface-resolved simulations of two-phase flows. However, their accurate representation in phase-field models remains elusive due to persistent numerical artifacts. This work rigorously proves that static droplets cannot exist in phase-field models governed by the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. Through equilibrium analysis of the governing equations, we demonstrate that equilibrium necessitates uniform chemical potential, which nullifies the interfacial force, enforcing a uniform pressure field. This directly contradicts the pressure jump required by Laplace's law for a curved interface, proving mechanical equilibrium is impossible. The results reveal an intrinsic incompatibility between non-flat equilibrium interfaces and the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system, provides a fundamental theoretical explanation for long-standing paradoxes such as droplet shrinkage and parasitic currents. This fundamental limitation applies universally to droplets/bubbles and necessitates re-evaluation of phase-field models for multiphase systems.</description>

      <title>Error Estimation for Adaptive Mesh Refinement in Droplet Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a one-dimensional shear force driven droplet formation model with a flux-based error estimation. The presented model is derived using asymptotic expansion and a front-tracking method to simulate the droplet interface. The model is then discretized using the Galerkin finite element method in the mixed form. However, the jumps in the solution gradients are discontinuous and can grow faster due to the highly convective pinch-off process. This leads to an erroneous droplet interface and incorrect curvature. Therefore, the mesh must be sufficiently refined to capture the interface accurately. The mixed form of the governing equation naturally provides smooth interface gradients that can be used to compute the error estimate. The computed error estimate is then used to drive the adaptive mesh refinement algorithm.</description>

      <title>Obstacle-tuned transition from chaotic to coherent vortex flows and odd diffusion in chiral active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a suspension of rotating colloids with a periodically patterned structure is here investigated by means of continuum theoretical predictions and hydrodynamic simulations. Close to the obstacle surface, rotors circulate opposite to their inherent direction of rotation as a result of unidirectional rotational stresses, which is in agreement with a prediction of the generalised Stokes equation. The resulting stationary background flow significantly affects the system dynamics and coexists with the intrinsic active turbulent behaviour. The relative importance of either of the two contributions can be controlled with the rotor density and the obstacle size, such that the system is either dominated by stationary vortices pinned to the obstacles or vivid active turbulent dynamics. While momentum dissipation into an underlying frictional substrate damps the related flows, small values of the friction can enhance the vortex flow around an obstacle. The colloids' diffusive dynamics are governed by odd diffusive fluxes guiding the colloids around the excluded volume introduced by obstacles, such that enhanced effective diffusive transport is obtained at finite obstruction. Our results pave the way to systematically address how confinement can be employed in order to control or harness the dynamics of colloidal chiral active turbulence and how the interplay of emerging edge currents and active turbulent dynamics at varying densities can be systematically determined.</description>

      <title>Interpretable data-driven turbulence modeling for separated flows using symbolic regression with unit constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have been applied to enhance turbulence modeling in recent years. However, the "black box" nature of most machine learning techniques poses significant interpretability challenges in improving turbulence models. This paper introduces a novel unit-constrained turbulence modeling framework using symbolic regression to overcome these challenges. The framework amends the constitutive equation of linear eddy viscosity models (LEVMs) by establishing explicit equations between the Reynolds stress deviation and mean flow quantities, thereby improving the LEVM model's predictive capability for large separated turbulence. Unit consistency constraints are applied to the symbolic expressions to ensure physical realizability. The effectiveness of the framework and the generalization capability of the learned model are demonstrated through its application to the separated flow over 2D periodic hills and a backward-facing step. Compared to the standard k-{\epsilon} model, the learned model shows significantly improved predictive accuracy for anisotropic Reynolds stresses, velocity and skin friction, while exhibiting promising generalization capabilities across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Averaged equations for disperse two-phase flow with interfacial properties and their closures for dilute suspension of droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a derivation of the averaged equations governing the motion of dispersed two-phase flows with interfacial transport. We begin by revisiting the two-fluid formulation, as well as the distributional form of the interfacial transport equation which holds on the entire domain. Following this, a general Lagrangian model is introduced, which accounts for the effects of both internal and interfacial properties of the dispersed inclusions (bubbles, droplets, or particles) within a continuous phase. This is achieved by derivation of conservation laws for particle surface and volume-integrated properties. By summing the internal and interfacial conservation laws, we derive a conservation equation for an arbitrary Lagrangian property associated with the inclusion. We then proceed by deriving the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments of the volume and surface distribution of an arbitrary Lagrangian property. Next, the averaged equations for the dispersed phase are derived through two distinct approaches: the particle-averaged (or Lagrangian-based) formalism, and the phase-averaged method. One important conclusion of this work is the demonstration of the relationship between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. We show that the dispersed phase-averaged equations can be interpreted as a series expansion of the particle-averaged moment equations. We then present a "hybrid" set of equations, consisting of phase-averaged equations for the continuous fluid phase, complemented by an arbitrary number of moment conservation.</description>

Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.</description>

      <title>Extending the Droplet-Wave Statistical Correspondence in Walking Droplet Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Walking droplets -- millimetric oil droplets that self-propel across the surface of a vibrating fluid bath -- exhibit striking emergent statistics that remain only partially understood. In particular, in a variety of experiments, a robust correspondence has been observed between the droplet's statistical distribution and the time-average of the wave field that guides it. Durey, Milewski, and Bush (2018) rigorously established such a correspondence in the case of a single droplet on a uniform, unbounded fluid bath, with a single, instantaneous droplet-bath impact during each vibration period. They also outlined how their result might extend to more general bath topography, and the work of Durey, Milewski, and Wang (2020) implemented such an approach for a circular bath. We attempt to complete this program in the present work, rigorously extending this statistical correspondence to account for arbitrary bath topography, arbitrary droplet-bath impact models, multiple droplet interactions, and non-resonant bouncing. We investigate this correspondence numerically in systems of one and two droplets in 1-D geometries, and particularly, we observe how the time-averaged wave field can distinguish between correlated and uncorrelated pairs of droplets.</description>

      <title>Improved Analytical Solution for Turbulent Flow in Channel and Circular Pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approximate analytical solution for turbulent flow in a channel was proposed in Fedoseyev (2023). It described the mean turbulent flow velocity as a superposition of parabolic (laminar) and superexponential (turbulent) solutions. The Alexeev Hydrodynamic Equations (AHE), proposed by \cite{Alexeev_1994}, were used as the governing equations to describe turbulent flow. Compared to the Navier-Stokes equations, the AHE include additional terms representing temporal and spatial fluctuations. These additional terms include a timescale multiplier $\tau$, and the AHE reduce to the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit as $\tau \to 0$
  In this study, we propose an improved analytical solution formula that provides better agreement with experimental data at high Reynolds numbers. The maximum discrepancy between the analytical solution and experimental data has been reduced from 5% to 2% for Reynolds numbers of order 100,000, and from 10% to 4% for Reynolds numbers up to 35,000,000, based on comparisons with experimental results ranging from the legacy work of Nikuradse (Prandtl group, 1932) to studies by Wei (1989), Zagarola (1996), van Doorne (2007), and the recent work of Pasch (2023).</description>

      <title>The effects of no-slip boundaries and external force torque on two-dimensional turbulence in a square domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional turbulence in a square no-slip domain without bottom drag using direct numerical simulations. The dynamics are shown to depend strongly on the torque $M$ of the external forcing. When $M$ is relatively large, a long-lived coherent vortex forms at the domain center, establishing a persistent angular momentum. At lower torques, the angular momentum undergoes random sign reversals due to spontaneous switching of the central vortex circulation, though it predominantly aligns with the torque direction. We investigate the transition between these regimes by smoothly varying $M$, observing that the time-averaged angular momentum of the system follows $\langle \mathcal{L} \rangle \propto M^{1/3}$. A significant part of the energy dissipates near the domain boundaries, requiring a revision of scaling laws for homogeneous systems. New scaling relations are proposed and they enable velocity profiles in the boundary layers to collapse onto a universal curve for simulations with varying fluid viscosities and forcing amplitudes. The velocity profiles feature a linear viscous sublayer followed by a short logarithmic region. The boundary layer thickness $\delta$ scales with the large-scale Reynolds number $Re$ as $\delta \sim L \cdot Re^{-1/2}$, indicating that the friction at no-slip walls is not sufficient to halt the inverse energy cascade before it reaches the system size $L$. The results highlight how no-slip boundaries and forcing asymmetry govern the dynamics of large-scale coherent structures in confined two-dimensional turbulence.</description>

      <title>Scale locality of information flow in shell models of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</description>

      <title>A Method of Fundamental Solutions for Large-Scale 3D Elastance and Mobility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is known to be effective for solving 3D Laplace and Stokes Dirichlet boundary value problems in the exterior of a large collection of simple smooth objects. Here we present new scalable MFS formulations for the corresponding elastance and mobility problems. The elastance problem computes the potentials of conductors with given net charges, while the mobility problem -- crucial to rheology and complex fluid applications -- computes rigid body velocities given net forces and torques on the particles. The key idea is orthogonal projection of the net charge (or forces and torques) in a rectangular variant of a "completion flow". The proposal is compatible with one-body preconditioning, resulting in well-conditioned square linear systems amenable to fast multipole accelerated iterative solution, thus a cost linear in the particle number. For large suspensions with moderate lubrication forces, MFS sources on inner proxy-surfaces give accuracy on par with a well-resolved boundary integral formulation. Our several numerical tests include a suspension of 10000 nearby ellipsoids, using 26 million total preconditioned degrees of freedom, where GMRES converges to five digits of accuracy in under two hours on one workstation.</description>

      <title>Microrheology with rotational Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.</description>
