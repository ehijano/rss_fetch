      <title>SOGRAND Assisted Guesswork Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposals have been made to reduce the guesswork of Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) for binary linear codes by leveraging codebook structure at the expense of degraded block error rate (BLER). We establish one can preserve guesswork reduction while eliminating BLER degradation through dynamic list decoding terminated based on Soft Output GRAND's error probability estimate. We illustrate the approach with a method inspired by published literature and compare performance with Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We establish that it is possible to provide the same BLER performance as GCD while reducing guesswork by up to a factor of 32.</description>

      <title>A Note on Function Correcting Codes for b-Symbol Read Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function-Correcting Codes (FCCs) is a novel paradigm in Error Control Coding introduced by Lenz et. al. 2023 for the binary substitution channel \cite{FCC}. FCCs aim to protect the function evaluation of data against errors instead of the data itself, thereby relaxing the redundancy requirements of the code. Later R. Premlal et. al. \cite{LFCC} gave new bounds on the optimal redundancy of FCCs and also extensively studied FCCs for linear functions. The notion of FCCs has also been extended to different channels such as symbol-pair read channel over the binary field by Xia et. al. \cite{FCSPC} and b-symbol read channel over finite fields by A.Singh et. al. \cite{FCBSC} In this work, we study FCCs for linear functions for the b-symbol read channel. We provide the Plotkin-like bound on FCCs for b-symbol read channel which reduces to a Plotkin-like bound for FCCs for the symbol-pair read channel when $b$=2. FCCs reduce to classical Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) when the function is bijective. Analogous to this our bound reduces to the Plotkin-bound for classical ECCS for both the b-symbol and symbol-pair read channels \cite{Plotkin-b-symbol, Plotkin-symbol-pair} when we consider linear bijective functions.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure Semantic Communications in the Presence of Intelligent Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the broadcast nature of wireless channels makes SemCom systems vulnerable to eavesdropping, which poses a serious threat to data privacy. Therefore, we investigate secure SemCom systems that preserve data privacy in the presence of eavesdroppers. Specifically, we first explore a scenario where eavesdroppers are intelligent and can exploit semantic information to reconstruct the transmitted data based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To counter this, we introduce novel eavesdropping attack strategies that utilize model inversion attacks and generative AI (GenAI) models. These strategies effectively reconstruct transmitted private data processed by the semantic encoder, operating in both glass-box and closed-box settings. Existing defense mechanisms against eavesdropping often cause significant distortions in the data reconstructed by eavesdroppers, potentially arousing their suspicion. To address this, we propose a semantic covert communication approach that leverages an invertible neural network (INN)-based signal steganography module. This module covertly embeds the channel input signal of a private sample into that of a non-sensitive host sample, thereby misleading eavesdroppers. Without access to this module, eavesdroppers can only extract host-related information and remain unaware of the hidden private content. We conduct extensive simulations under various channel conditions in image transmission tasks. Numerical results show that while conventional eavesdropping strategies achieve a success rate of over 80\% in reconstructing private information, the proposed semantic covert communication effectively reduces the eavesdropping success rate to 0.</description>

      <title>Torsion of $\alpha$-connections on the density manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the torsion of the $\alpha$-connections defined on the density manifold in terms of a regular Riemannian metric. In the case of the Fisher-Rao metric our results confirm the fact that all $\alpha$-connections are torsion free. For the $\alpha$-connections obtained by the Otto metric, we show that, except for $\alpha = -1$, they are not torsion free.</description>

      <title>A Comparison among Single Carrier, OFDM, and OTFS in mmWave Multi-Connectivity Downlink Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a comparative study of common wireless communication waveforms, namely the single carrier (SC), orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and orthogonal time-frequency-space (OTFS) modulation in a millimeter wave (mmWave) downlink multi-connectivity scenario, where multiple access points (APs) jointly serve a given user under imperfect time and frequency synchronization errors. For a fair comparison, all the three waveforms are evaluated using variants of common frequency domain equalization (FDE). To this end, a novel cross domain iterative detection for OTFS is proposed. The performance of the different waveforms is evaluated numerically in terms of pragmatic capacity. The numerical results show that OTFS significantly outperforms SC and OFDM at cost of reasonably increased complexity, because of the low cyclic-prefix (CP) overhead and the effectiveness of the proposed detection.</description>

      <title>Intersection of linear and multi-twisted codes with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a formula for constructing a generator matrix for the intersection of any pair of linear codes over a finite field. Consequently, we establish a condition under which a linear code has a trivial intersection with another linear code (or its Galois dual). Furthermore, we provide a condition for reversibility and propose a generator matrix formula for the largest reversible subcode of any linear code. We then focus on the comprehensive class of multi-twisted (MT) codes, which are naturally and more effectively represented using generator polynomial matrices (GPMs). We prove that the reversed code of an MT code remains MT and derive an explicit formula for its GPM. Additionally, we examine the intersection of a pair of MT codes, possibly with different shift constants, and demonstrate that this intersection is not necessarily MT. However, when the intersection has an MT structure, we determine the corresponding shift constants. We also establish a GPM formula for the intersection of a pair of MT codes with the same shift constants. This result enables us to derive a GPM formula for the intersection of an MT code and the Galois dual of another MT code. Finally, we examine conditions for various properties on MT codes. Perhaps most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for an MT code to be Galois self-orthogonal, Galois dual-containing, Galois linear complementary dual (LCD), or reversible.</description>

      <title>SU(1,1) Nonlinear Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6888</link>
      <description>arXiv:1212.6888v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of construction of the nonlinear coherent states based on the hypergeometric- type operators associated to the Weyl-Heisenberg group [J:P hys:A 45(2012) 095304], are generalized to the similar states for the arbitrary Lie group SU(1, 1). By using of a discrete, unitary and irreducible representation of the Lie algebra su(1, 1) wide range of generalized nonlinear coherent states(GNCS) have been introduced, which admit a resolution of the identity through positive definite measures on the complex plane. We have shown that realization of these states for different values of the deformation pa- rameters r = 1 and 2 lead to the well-known Klauder-Perelomov and Barut-Girardello coherent states associated to the Irreps of the Lie algebra su(1, 1), respectively. It is worth to mention that, like the canonical coherent states, GNCS possess the temporal stability property. Finally, studying some statistical characters implies that they have indeed nonclassical features such as squeezing, anti-bunching effect and sub-Poissonian statistics, too.</description>

      <title>Quantum Doeblin Coefficients: Interpretations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the Doeblin coefficient of a classical channel provides an efficiently computable upper bound on the total-variation contraction coefficient of the channel, leading to what is known as a strong data-processing inequality. Here, we investigate quantum Doeblin coefficients as a generalization of the classical concept. In particular, we define various new quantum Doeblin coefficients, one of which has several desirable properties, including concatenation and multiplicativity, in addition to being efficiently computable. We also develop various interpretations of two of the quantum Doeblin coefficients, including representations as minimal singlet fractions, exclusion values, reverse max-mutual and oveloH informations, reverse robustnesses, and hypothesis testing reverse mutual and oveloH informations. Our interpretations of quantum Doeblin coefficients as either entanglement-assisted or unassisted exclusion values are particularly appealing, indicating that they are proportional to the best possible error probabilities one could achieve in state-exclusion tasks by making use of the channel. We also outline various applications of quantum Doeblin coefficients, ranging from limitations on quantum machine learning algorithms that use parameterized quantum circuits (noise-induced barren plateaus), on error mitigation protocols, on the sample complexity of noisy quantum hypothesis testing, on the fairness of noisy quantum models, and on mixing times of time-varying channels. All of these applications make use of the fact that quantum Doeblin coefficients appear in upper bounds on various trace-distance contraction coefficients of a channel. Furthermore, in all of these applications, our analysis using Doeblin coefficients provides improvements of various kinds over contributions from prior literature, both in terms of generality and being efficiently computable.</description>

      <title>CLuP-Based Dual-Deconvolution in Automotive ISAC Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate target parameter estimation of range, velocity, and angle is essential for vehicle safety in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. To enable spectrum sharing, ADAS may employ integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper examines a dual-deconvolution automotive ISAC scenario where the radar waveform is known but the propagation channel is not, while in the communications domain, the channel is known but the transmitted message is not. Conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for automotive target parameters is computationally demanding. To address this, we propose a low-complexity approach using the controlled loosening-up (CLuP) algorithm, which employs iterative refinement for efficient separation and estimation of radar targets. We achieve this through a nuclear norm restriction that stabilizes the problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of this approach under high-mobility and noisy automotive environments, highlighting CLuP's potential as a scalable, real-time solution for ISAC in future vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>Channel Coding meets Sequence Design via Machine Learning for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For integrated sensing and communications, an intriguing question is whether information-bearing channel-coded signals can be reused for sensing - specifically ranging. This question forces the hitherto non-overlapping fields of channel coding (communications) and sequence design (sensing) to intersect by motivating the design of error-correcting codes that have good autocorrelation properties. In this letter, we demonstrate how machine learning (ML) is well-suited for designing such codes, especially for short block lengths. As an example, for rate 1/2 and block length 32, we show that even an unsophisticated ML code has a bit-error rate performance similar to a Polar code with the same parameters, but with autocorrelation sidelobes 24dB lower. While a length-32 Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence has zero autocorrelation sidelobes, there are only 16 such sequences and hence, a 1/2 code rate cannot be realized by using ZC sequences as codewords. Hence, ML bridges channel coding and sequence design by trading off an ideal autocorrelation function for a large (i.e., rate-dependent) codebook size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, there is increasing demand for real-time data collection using UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks. This paper investigates the problem of minimizing the age of information (AoI) in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks by optimizing the UAV flight routing. We formulate the AoI minimization task and propose a large language model (LLM)-assisted UAV routing algorithm (LAURA). LAURA employs an LLM as intelligent crossover operators within an evolutionary optimization framework to efficiently explore the solution space. Simulation results show that LAURA outperforms benchmark methods in reducing the maximum AoI, especially in scenarios with a large number of sensor nodes.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic subset selection of multivariate Markov chains via submodular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimally projecting the transition matrix of a finite ergodic multivariate Markov chain onto a lower-dimensional state space. Specifically, we seek to construct a projected Markov chain that optimizes various information-theoretic criteria under cardinality constraints. These criteria include entropy rate, information-theoretic distance to factorizability, independence, and stationarity. We formulate these tasks as best subset selection problems over multivariate Markov chains and leverage the submodular (or supermodular) structure of the objective functions to develop efficient greedy-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We extend our analysis to $k$-submodular settings and introduce a generalized version of the distorted greedy algorithm, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we illustrate the theory and algorithms through extensive numerical experiments with publicly available code on multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli-Laplace and Curie-Weiss model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shor algorithm led to the discovery of multiple vulnerabilities in a number of cryptosystems. As a result, post-quantum cryptography attempts to provide cryptographic solutions that can face these attacks, ensuring the security of sensitive data in a future where quantum computers are assumed to exist. Error correcting codes are a source for efficiency when it comes to signatures, especially random ones described in this paper, being quantum-resistant and reaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, thus offering a good trade-off between rate and distance. In the light of this discussion, we introduce a signature based on a family of linear error-block codes (LEB), with strong algebraic properties: it is the family of quasi-cyclic LEB codes that we do define algebraically during this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks into space introduces technical challenges that conventional bit-oriented communication approaches cannot efficiently address, including intermittent connectivity, severe latency, limited bandwidth, and constrained onboard resources. To overcome these limitations, semantic communication has emerged as a transformative paradigm, shifting the communication focus from transmitting raw data to delivering context-aware, missionrelevant information. In this article, we propose a semantic communication architecture explicitly tailored for the 6G Internet of Space (IoS), integrating multi-modal semantic processing, AIdriven semantic encoding and decoding, and adaptive transmission mechanisms optimized for space environments. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is demonstrated through a representative deep-space scenario involving semantic-based monitoring of Mars dust storms. Finally, we outline open research challenges and discuss future directions toward realizing practical semantic-enabled IoS systems.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Private Regression in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of privately obtaining prediction error guarantees in ordinary least-squares regression problems with Gaussian covariates (with unknown covariance structure). We provide the first sample-optimal polynomial time algorithm for this task under both pure and approximate differential privacy. We show that any improvement to the sample complexity of our algorithm would violate either statistical-query or information-theoretic lower bounds. Additionally, our algorithm is robust to a small fraction of arbitrary outliers and achieves optimal error rates as a function of the fraction of outliers. In contrast, all prior efficient algorithms either incurred sample complexities with sub-optimal dimension dependence, scaling with the condition number of the covariates, or obtained a polynomially worse dependence on the privacy parameters.
  Our technical contributions are two-fold: first, we leverage resilience guarantees of Gaussians within the sum-of-squares framework. As a consequence, we obtain efficient sum-of-squares algorithms for regression with optimal robustness rates and sample complexity. Second, we generalize the recent robustness-to-privacy framework [HKMN23, (arXiv:2212.05015)] to account for the geometry induced by the covariance of the input samples. This framework crucially relies on the robust estimators to be sum-of-squares algorithms, and combining the two steps yields a sample-optimal private regression algorithm. We believe our techniques are of independent interest, and we demonstrate this by obtaining an efficient algorithm for covariance-aware mean estimation, with an optimal dependence on the privacy parameters.</description>

      <title>SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metrization of statistical divergences is valuable in both theoretical and practical aspects. One approach to obtaining metrics associated with divergences is to consider their fractional powers. Motivated by this idea, Os\'an, Bussandri, and Lamberti (2018) studied the metrization of fractional powers of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between multinomial distributions and posed an open problem. In this short note, we provide an affirmative answer to their conjecture. Moreover, our method is also applicable to fractional powers of $f$-divergences between Cauchy distributions.</description>

      <title>Balanced Low-Complexity and Flexible Error-Correction List Flip Decoding for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benefiting from performance advantages under short code lengths, polar codes are well-suited for certain scenarios, such as the future Internet of Things (IoT) applications that require high reliability and low power. Existing list flip decoders can efficiently further enhance the error-correction performance of polar codes with finite code lengths, particularly the dynamic successive cancellation list flip (D-SCLF) decoder with flexible high-order error-correction capability (FHECC). However, to the best of our knowledge, current list flip decoders cannot effectively balance complexity and error-correction efficiency. To address this, we propose a parity-check-aided D-SCLF (PC-DSCLF) decoder. This decoder, based on FHECC and the characteristics of the list flip decoding process, introduces a simplified flip metric and a hybrid check scheme, along with a decoding method that supports the check scheme, enabling it to retain FHECC while achieving low complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed PC-DSCLF decoder achieves up to a 51.1\% average complexity reduction compared to the D-SCLF algorithm with distributed CRC for $PC(512, 256+24)$</description>

      <title>On the Low-SNR Asymptotic Capacity of Two Types of Optical Wireless Channels under Average-Intensity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15756v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of optical wireless channels under average-intensity constraints. One is called the Gaussian optical intensity channel, where the channel output models the converted electrical current corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The other one is the Poisson optical intensity channel, where the channel output models the number of received photons corrupted by a dark current. When the average input intensity $\mathcal{E}$ is small, the capacity of the Gaussian optical intensity channel is shown to scale as $\mathcal{E}\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}}{2}}$, and the capacity of the Poisson optical intensity channel as $\mathcal{E}\log\log\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}$. This closes the existing capacity gaps in these two channels.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic User Scheduling for Secure RIS-aided Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for suboptimal and optimal opportunistic scheduling schemes in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided {single antenna} system with multiple eavesdroppers in approximate closed form. A suboptimal scheduling (SS) scheme is analyzed, which is used when the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping links is unavailable, and the optimal scheduling (OS) scheme is also analyzed, which is used when the global CSI is available. For each scheme, we provide a simplified expression for the SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime to demonstrate its behavior as a function of the key system parameters. At high SNR, the SOP saturates to a constant level which decreases exponentially with the number of RIS elements in the SS scheme and with the product of the number of RIS elements and the number of users in the OS scheme. We also show that the derived SOP of the SS scheme can directly provide the SOP for the best antenna-user pair scheduling scheme in a multiple antenna system. We compare the performance of the opportunistic user scheduling schemes with that of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheduling scheme which chooses a pair of users in each time slot for scheduling and we show that the opportunistic schemes outperform the NOMA-based scheme. We also derive a closed-form expression for the SOP of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided scheduling scheme in order to compare it with that of the RIS-aided system. It is found that the RIS-aided system outperforms the relay-aided systems when the number of RIS elements is sufficiently large. An increased number of RIS elements is required to outperform the relay-aided system at higher operating frequencies.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization in Panel-Based LIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large intelligent surface (LIS) has gained momentum as a potential 6G-enabling technology that expands the benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). On the other hand, orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM) may give a promising direction for efficient exploitation of the spatial resources, analogous as what is achieved with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the frequency domain. To this end, we study how to enforce channel orthogonality in a panel-based LIS (P-LIS) scenario. Our proposed method consists of having a subset of active LIS-panels coherently serving a set of users, and another subset of LIS-panels operating in a novel low-power mode by implementing a receive and re-transmit (RRTx) process. This results in an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel, where we characterize the RRTx processing required to achieve simultaneous orthogonality in time and space. We then employ the remaining degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the orthogonality constraint to minimize the RRTx processing power, where we derive a closed-form global minimizer, allowing for efficient implementation of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Multi-User MISO with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: A DRL-Based Sum-Rate Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a novel signal processing paradigm that enables over-the-air processing of electromagnetic waves at the speed of light. Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication for Joint Image Transmission and Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing communication efficiency. However, most existing research emphasizes single-task reconstruction, neglecting model adaptability and generalization across multi-task systems. In this paper, we propose a novel generative semantic communication system that supports both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Our approach builds upon semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at both the transmitter and receiver, with each semantic KB comprising a source KB and a task KB. The source KB at the transmitter leverages a hierarchical Swin-Transformer, a generative AI scheme, to extract multi-level features from the input image. Concurrently, the counterpart source KB at the receiver utilizes hierarchical residual blocks to generate task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the task KBs adopt a semantic similarity model to map different task requirements into pre-defined task instructions, thereby facilitating the feature selection of the source KBs. Additionally, we develop a unified residual block-based joint source and channel (JSCC) encoder and two task-specific JSCC decoders to achieve the two image tasks. In particular, a generative diffusion model is adopted to construct the JSCC decoder for the image reconstruction task. Experimental results show that our multi-task generative semantic communication system outperforms previous single-task communication systems in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt-enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. To further enhance reconstruction quality, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>

      <title>Causal Emergence 2.0: Quantifying emergent complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems can be described at myriad different scales, and their causal workings often have multiscale structure (e.g., a computer can be described at the microscale of its hardware circuitry, the mesoscale of its machine code, and the macroscale of its operating system). While scientists study and model systems across the full hierarchy of their scales, from microphysics to macroeconomics, there is debate about what the macroscales of systems can possibly add beyond mere compression. To resolve this longstanding issue, here a new theory of emergence is introduced wherein the different scales of a system are treated like slices of a higher-dimensional object. The theory can distinguish which of these scales possess unique causal contributions, and which are not causally relevant. Constructed from an axiomatic notion of causation, the theory's application is demonstrated in coarse-grains of Markov chains. It identifies all cases of macroscale causation: instances where reduction to a microscale is possible, yet lossy about causation. Furthermore, the theory posits a causal apportioning schema that calculates the causal contribution of each scale, showing what each uniquely adds. Finally, it reveals a novel measure of emergent complexity: how widely distributed a system's causal workings are across its hierarchy of scales.</description>

      <title>Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vintage factor analysis is one important type of factor analysis that aims to first find a low-dimensional representation of the original data, and then to seek a rotation such that the rotated low-dimensional representation is scientifically meaningful. The most widely used vintage factor analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation. Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided to date mainly because varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over the set of orthogonal matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each row of an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gain and flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed procedure in a broader context. Adopting this new deflation varimax as the second step after PCA, we further analyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Our results show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the minimax optimal rate when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNR regime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflation varimax when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. The modified procedure is shown to be minimax optimal in all SNR regimes. Our theory is valid for finite sample and allows the number of the latent factors to grow with the sample size as well as the ambient dimension to grow with, or even exceed, the sample size. Extensive simulation and real data analysis further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erasures are the primary type of errors in physical systems dominated by leakage errors. While quantum error correction (QEC) using stabilizer codes can combat erasure errors, it remains unknown which constructions achieve capacity performance. If such codes exist, decoders with linear runtime in the code length are also desired. In this paper, we present erasure capacity-achieving quantum codes under maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), though MLD requires cubic runtime in the code length. For QEC, using an accurate decoder with the shortest possible runtime will minimize the degradation of quantum information while awaiting the decoder's decision. To address this, we propose belief propagation (BP) decoders that run in linear time and exploit error degeneracy in stabilizer codes, achieving capacity or near-capacity performance for a broad class of codes, including bicycle codes, product codes, and topological codes. We furthermore explore the potential of our BP decoders to handle mixed erasure and depolarizing errors, and also local deletion errors via concatenation with permutation invariant codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in quantum physics, dictating the behavior and dynamics of physical systems. In this paper, we develop a hypothesis-testing framework for quantum dynamics symmetry using a limited number of queries to the unknown unitary operation and establish the quantum max-relative entropy lower bound for the type-II error. We construct optimal ancilla-free protocols that achieve optimal type-II error probability for testing time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) and diagonal symmetry (Z-symmetry) with limited queries. Contrasting with the advantages of indefinite causal order strategies in various quantum information processing tasks, we show that parallel, adaptive, and indefinite causal order strategies have equal power for our tasks. We establish optimal protocols for T-symmetry testing and Z-symmetry testing for 6 and 5 queries, respectively, from which we infer that the type-II error exhibits a decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(m^{-2})$ with respect to the number of queries $m$. This represents a significant improvement over the basic repetition protocols without using global entanglement, where the error decays at a slower rate of $\mathcal{O}(m^{-1})$.</description>

      <title>Rethink Delay Doppler Channels and Time-Frequency Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes (including the current active VOFDM/OTFS) can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over a decade ago.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning Beamforming Codebooks for Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station (BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This paper proposes a learning-based approach for codebook construction and for codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the temporal dependencies between measurements.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic One-Time Programs from Geometrically Local $\text{QNC}_0$ Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and $D$-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant $D$. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.
  Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order $2$) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific $2 \mapsto 1$ QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.</description>
