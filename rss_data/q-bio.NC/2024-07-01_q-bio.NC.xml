      <title>Spectral Brain Graph Neural Network for Prediction of Anxiety in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) frequently exhibit comorbid anxiety, which contributes to impairment and requires treatment. Therefore, it is critical to investigate co-occurring autism and anxiety with functional imaging tools to understand the brain mechanisms of this comorbidity. Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 2nd edition (MASC-2) score is a common tool to evaluate the daily anxiety level in autistic children. Predicting MASC-2 score with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data will help gain more insights into the brain functional networks of children with ASD complicated by anxiety. However, most of the current graph neural network (GNN) studies using fMRI only focus on graph operations but ignore the spectral features. In this paper, we explored the feasibility of using spectral features to predict the MASC-2 total scores. We proposed SpectBGNN, a graph-based network, which uses spectral features and integrates graph spectral filtering layers to extract hidden information. We experimented with multiple spectral analysis algorithms and compared the performance of the SpectBGNN model with CPM, GAT, and BrainGNN on a dataset consisting of 26 typically developing and 70 ASD children with 5-fold cross-validation. We showed that among all spectral analysis algorithms tested, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or Welch's Power Spectrum Density (PSD) as node features performs significantly better than correlation features, and adding the graph spectral filtering layer significantly increases the network's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of various supervised machine learning models in analyzing highly correlated neural signaling data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, with a focus on predicting obsessive-compulsive disorder scales. We simulated a dataset to mimic the correlation structures commonly found in imaging data and evaluated logistic regression, elastic networks, random forests, and XGBoost on their ability to handle multicollinearity and accurately identify predictive features. Our study aims to guide the selection of appropriate machine learning methods for processing neuroimaging data, highlighting models that best capture underlying signals in high feature correlations and prioritize clinically relevant features associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).</description>

      <title>Uncovering cognitive taskonomy through transfer learning in masked autoencoder-based fMRI reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data reconstruction is a widely used pre-training task to learn the generalized features for many downstream tasks. Although reconstruction tasks have been applied to neural signal completion and denoising, neural signal reconstruction is less studied. Here, we employ the masked autoencoder (MAE) model to reconstruct functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and utilize a transfer learning framework to obtain the cognitive taskonomy, a matrix to quantify the similarity between cognitive tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the MAE model effectively captures the temporal dynamics patterns and interactions within the brain regions, enabling robust cross-subject fMRI signal reconstruction. The cognitive taskonomy derived from the transfer learning framework reveals the relationships among cognitive tasks, highlighting subtask correlations within motor tasks and similarities between emotion, social, and gambling tasks. Our study suggests that the fMRI reconstruction with MAE model can uncover the latent representation and the obtained taskonomy offers guidance for selecting source tasks in neural decoding tasks for improving the decoding performance on target tasks.</description>

      <title>Decoding moral judgement from text: a pilot study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moral judgement is a complex human reaction that engages cognitive and emotional dimensions. While some of the morality neural correlates are known, it is currently unclear if we can detect moral violation at a single-trial level. In a pilot study, here we explore the feasibility of moral judgement decoding from text stimuli with passive brain-computer interfaces. For effective moral judgement elicitation, we use video-audio affective priming prior to text stimuli presentation and attribute the text to moral agents. Our results show that further efforts are necessary to achieve reliable classification between moral congruency vs. incongruency states. We obtain good accuracy results for neutral vs. morally-charged trials. With this research, we try to pave the way towards neuroadaptive human-computer interaction and more human-compatible large language models (LLMs)</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Identifying Anatomical Biomarkers of Early Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the aging population by impairing cognitive and motor functions. Early detection of AD through accessible methodologies like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for developing effective interventions to halt or slow the disease's progression. This study aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of machine learning techniques for selecting MRI-based biomarkers and classifying individuals into healthy controls (HC) and unstable controls (uHC) who later show mild cognitive impairment within five years. The research utilizes MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroinformatics Initiative (ADNI) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), focusing on both HC and uHC participants. The study addresses the challenges of imbalanced data by testing classification methods on balanced and unbalanced datasets, and harmonizes data using polynomial regression to mitigate nuisance variables like age, gender, and intracranial volume. Results indicate that Gaussian Naive Bayes and RusBoost classifiers shows an optimal performance, achieving accuracies of up to 76.46% and 72.48% respectively on the ADNI dataset. For the OASIS-3 dataset, Kernel Naive Bayes and RusBoost yield accuracies ranging from 64.66% to 75.71%, improving further in age-matched datasets. Brain regions like the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex are identified as significantly impacted during early cognitive decline. Despite limitations such as small sample sizes, the study's harmonization approach enhances the robustness of biomarker selection, suggesting the potential of this semi-automatic machine learning pipeline for early AD detection using MRI.</description>

      <title>Module control of network analysis in psychopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The network approach to characterizing psychopathology departs from traditional latent categorical and dimensional approaches. Causal interplay among symptoms contributed to dynamic psychopathology system. Therefore, analyzing the symptom clusters is critical for understanding mental disorders. Furthermore, despite extensive research studying the topological features of symptom networks, the control relationships between symptoms remain largely unclear. Here, we present a novel systematizing concept, module control, to analyze the control principle of the symptom network at a module level. We introduce Module Control Network (MCN) to identify key modules that regulate the network's behavior. By applying our approach to a multivariate psychological dataset, we discover that non-emotional modules, such as sleep-related and stress-related modules, are the primary controlling modules in the symptom network. Our findings indicate that module control can expose central symptom cluster governing psychopathology network, offering novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders and individualized approach to psychological interventions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for Latent Integration with An Application to Heterogeneous Neuronal Activity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting dynamic patterns of task-specific responses shared across heterogeneous datasets is an essential and challenging problem in many scientific applications in medical science and neuroscience. In our motivating example of rodent electrophysiological data, identifying the dynamical patterns in neuronal activity associated with ongoing cognitive demands and behavior is key to uncovering the neural mechanisms of memory. One of the greatest challenges in investigating a cross-subject biological process is that the systematic heterogeneity across individuals could significantly undermine the power of existing machine learning methods to identify the underlying biological dynamics. In addition, many technically challenging neurobiological experiments are conducted on only a handful of subjects where rich longitudinal data are available for each subject. The low sample sizes of such experiments could further reduce the power to detect common dynamic patterns among subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous data integration framework based on optimal transport to extract shared patterns in complex biological processes. The key advantages of the proposed method are that it can increase discriminating power in identifying common patterns by reducing heterogeneity unrelated to the signal by aligning the extracted latent spatiotemporal information across subjects. Our approach is effective even with a small number of subjects, and does not require auxiliary matching information for the alignment. In particular, our method can align longitudinal data across heterogeneous subjects in a common latent space to capture the dynamics of shared patterns while utilizing temporal dependency within subjects.</description>

      <title>Deconvolving Complex Neuronal Networks into Interpretable Task-Specific Connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-specific functional MRI (fMRI) images provide excellent modalities for studying the neuronal basis of cognitive processes. We use fMRI data to formulate and solve the problem of deconvolving task-specific aggregate neuronal networks into a set of basic building blocks called canonical networks, to use these networks for functional characterization, and to characterize the physiological basis of these responses by mapping them to regions of the brain. Our results show excellent task-specificity of canonical networks, i.e., the expression of a small number of canonical networks can be used to accurately predict tasks; generalizability across cohorts, i.e., canonical networks are conserved across diverse populations, studies, and acquisition protocols; and that canonical networks have strong anatomical and physiological basis. From a methods perspective, the problem of identifying these canonical networks poses challenges rooted in the high dimensionality, small sample size, acquisition variability, and noise. Our deconvolution technique is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) that identifies canonical networks as factors of a suitably constructed matrix. We demonstrate that our method scales to large datasets, yields stable and accurate factors, and is robust to noise.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics provide the underlying physical mechanism of the perceptual rivalry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptual rivalry, where conflicting sensory information leads to alternating perceptions crucial for associated cognitive function, has attracted researcher's attention for long. Despite progresses being made, recent studies have revealed limitations and inconsistencies in our understanding across various rivalry contexts. We develop a unified physical framework, where perception undergoes a consecutive phase transition process encompassing different multi-state competitions. We reveal the underlying mechanisms of perceptual rivalry by identifying dominant switching paths among perceptual states and quantifying mean perceptual durations, switching frequencies, and proportions of different perceptions. We uncover the underlying nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics by analyzing average nonequilibrium flux and entropy production rate, while associated time series irreversibility reflects the underlying nonequilibrium mechanism of perceptual rivalry and link thermodynamical results with neuro-electrophysiological experiments. Our framework provides a global and physical understanding of brain perception, which may go beyond cognitive science or psychology but embodies the connection with wider fields as decision-making.</description>

      <title>Neurodevelopmental disorders modeling using isogeometric analysis, dynamic domain expansion and local refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have arisen as one of the most prevailing chronic diseases within the US. Often associated with severe adverse impacts on the formation of vital central and peripheral nervous systems during the neurodevelopmental process, NDDs are comprised of a broad spectrum of disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy, characterized by progressive and pervasive detriments to cognitive, speech, memory, motor, and other neurological functions in patients. However, the heterogeneous nature of NDDs poses a significant roadblock to identifying the exact pathogenesis, impeding accurate diagnosis and the development of targeted treatment planning. A computational NDDs model holds immense potential in enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted factors involved and could assist in identifying the root causes to expedite treatment development. To tackle this challenge, we introduce optimal neurotrophin concentration to the driving force and degradation of neurotrophin to the synaptogenesis process of a 2D phase field neuron growth model using isogeometric analysis to simulate neurite retraction and atrophy. The optimal neurotrophin concentration effectively captures the inverse relationship between neurotrophin levels and neurite survival, while its degradation regulates concentration levels. Leveraging dynamic domain expansion, the model efficiently expands the domain based on outgrowth patterns to minimize degrees of freedom. Based on truncated T-splines, our model simulates the evolving process of complex neurite structures by applying local refinement adaptively to the cell/neurite boundary. Furthermore, a thorough parameter investigation is conducted with detailed comparisons against neuron cell cultures in experiments, enhancing our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying NDDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on an innovative task of extracting equations from incomplete data, moving away from traditional methods used for complete solutions. The study addresses the challenge of extracting equations from data, particularly in the study of brain activity using electrophysiological data, which is often limited by insufficient information. The study provides a brief review of existing open-source equation derivation approaches in the context of modeling brain activity. The section below introduces a novel algorithm that employs incomplete data and prior domain knowledge to recover differential equations. The algorithm's practicality in real-world scenarios is demonstrated through its application on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Synaptic effects on the intermittent synchronization of gamma rhythms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization of neural activity in the gamma frequency band is associated with various cognitive phenomena. Abnormalities of gamma synchronization may underlie symptoms of several neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Properties of neural oscillations in the gamma band depend critically on the synaptic properties of the underlying circuits. This study explores how synaptic properties in pyramidal-interneuronal circuits affect not only the average synchronization strength but also the fine temporal patterning of neural synchrony. If two signals show only moderate synchrony strength, it may be possible to consider these dynamics as alternating between synchronized and desynchronized states. We use a model of connected circuits that produces pyramidal-interneuronal gamma (PING) oscillations to explore the temporal patterning of synchronized and desynchronized intervals. Changes in synaptic strength may alter the temporal patterning of synchronized dynamics (even if the average synchrony strength is not changed). Larger values of local synaptic connections promote longer desynchronization durations, while larger values of long-range synaptic connections promote shorter desynchronization durations. Furthermore, we show that circuits with different temporal patterning of synchronization may have different sensitivity to synaptic input. Thus, the alterations of synaptic strength may mediate physiological properties of neural circuits not only through change in the average synchrony level of gamma oscillations, but also through change in how synchrony is patterned in time over very short time scales.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Open Data In Neurophysiology: Advancements, Solutions &amp; Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across the life sciences, an ongoing effort over the last 50 years has made data and methods more reproducible and transparent. This openness has led to transformative insights and vastly accelerated scientific progress. For example, structural biology and genomics have undertaken systematic collection and publication of protein sequences and structures over the past half-century, and these data have led to scientific breakthroughs that were unthinkable when data collection first began. We believe that neuroscience is poised to follow the same path, and that principles of open data and open science will transform our understanding of the nervous system in ways that are impossible to predict at the moment.
  To this end, new social structures along with active and open scientific communities are essential to facilitate and expand the still limited adoption of open science practices in our field. Unified by shared values of openness, we set out to organize a symposium for Open Data in Neuroscience (ODIN) to strengthen our community and facilitate transformative neuroscience research at large. In this report, we share what we learned during this first ODIN event. We also lay out plans for how to grow this movement, document emerging conversations, and propose a path toward a better and more transparent science of tomorrow.</description>

      <title>Individual brain parcellation: Review of methods, validations and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual brains vary greatly in morphology, connectivity and organization. The applicability of group-level parcellations is limited by the rapid development of precision medicine today because they do not take into account the variation of parcels at the individual level. Accurate mapping of brain functional regions at the individual level is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of the variations in brain function and behaviors, early and precise identification of brain abnormalities, as well as personalized treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. With the development of neuroimaging and machine learning techniques, studies on individual brain parcellation are booming. In this paper, we offer an overview of recent advances in the methodologies of individual brain parcellation, including optimization- and learning-based methods. Comprehensive evaluation metrics to validate individual brain mapping have been introduced. We also review the studies of how individual brain mapping promotes neuroscience research and clinical medicine. Finally, we summarize the major challenges and important future directions of individualized brain parcellation. Collectively, we intend to offer a thorough overview of individual brain parcellation methods, validations, and applications, along with highlighting the current challenges that call for an urgent demand for integrated platforms that integrate datasets, methods, and validations.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Representations for Causal Cognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex adaptive agents consistently achieve their goals by solving problems that seem to require an understanding of causal information, information pertaining to the causal relationships that exist among elements of combined agent-environment systems. Causal cognition studies and describes the main characteristics of causal learning and reasoning in human and non-human animals, offering a conceptual framework to discuss cognitive performances based on the level of apparent causal understanding of a task. Despite the use of formal intervention-based models of causality, including causal Bayesian networks, psychological and behavioural research on causal cognition does not yet offer a computational account that operationalises how agents acquire a causal understanding of the world. Machine and reinforcement learning research on causality, especially involving disentanglement as a candidate process to build causal representations, represent on the one hand a concrete attempt at designing causal artificial agents that can shed light on the inner workings of natural causal cognition. In this work, we connect these two areas of research to build a unifying framework for causal cognition that will offer a computational perspective on studies of animal cognition, and provide insights in the development of new algorithms for causal reinforcement learning in AI.</description>

Abstract: Landmark universal function approximation results for neural networks with trained weights and biases provided impetus for the ubiquitous use of neural networks as learning models in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and neuroscience. Recent work has pushed the bounds of universal approximation by showing that arbitrary functions can similarly be learned by tuning smaller subsets of parameters, for example the output weights, within randomly initialized networks. Motivated by the fact that biases can be interpreted as biologically plausible mechanisms for adjusting unit outputs in neural networks, such as tonic inputs or activation thresholds, we investigate the expressivity of neural networks with random weights where only biases are optimized. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence demonstrating that feedforward neural networks with fixed random weights can be trained to perform multiple tasks by learning biases only. We further show that an equivalent result holds for recurrent neural networks predicting dynamical system trajectories. Our results are relevant to neuroscience, where they demonstrate the potential for behaviourally relevant changes in dynamics without modifying synaptic weights, as well as for AI, where they shed light on multi-task methods such as bias fine-tuning and unit masking.</description>

Abstract: Biological synaptic transmission is unreliable, and this unreliability likely degrades neural circuit performance. While there are biophysical mechanisms that can increase reliability, for instance by increasing vesicle release probability, these mechanisms cost energy. We examined four such mechanisms along with the associated scaling of the energetic costs. We then embedded these energetic costs for reliability in artificial neural networks (ANN) with trainable stochastic synapses, and trained these networks on standard image classification tasks. The resulting networks revealed a tradeoff between circuit performance and the energetic cost of synaptic reliability. Additionally, the optimised networks exhibited two testable predictions consistent with pre-existing experimental data. Specifically, synapses with lower variability tended to have 1) higher input firing rates and 2) lower learning rates. Surprisingly, these predictions also arise when synapse statistics are inferred through Bayesian inference. Indeed, we were able to find a formal, theoretical link between the performance-reliability cost tradeoff and Bayesian inference. This connection suggests two incompatible possibilities: evolution may have chanced upon a scheme for implementing Bayesian inference by optimising energy efficiency, or alternatively, energy efficient synapses may display signatures of Bayesian inference without actually using Bayes to reason about uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Network Structure Trumps Neuron Dynamics: Insights from Drosophila Connectome Simulations</title>

Abstract: Despite the success of artificial neural networks, the necessity of real network structures in simulating intelligence remains unclear. Utilizing the largest adult Drosophila connectome data set, we constructed a large-scale network communication model framework based on simple neuronal activation mechanisms to simulate the activation behavior observed in the connectome. The results demonstrate that even with simple propagation rules, models based on real neural network structures can generate activation patterns similar to those in the actual brain. Importantly, we found that using different neuronal dynamics models, all produced similar activation patterns. This consistency across different models emphasizes the crucial role of network topology in neural information processing, challenging views that rely solely on neuron count or complex individual neuron dynamics.Moreover, we test the influence of network reconnect rate and find that even 1%'s reconnect rate will ruin the activation patterns appeared before. By comparing network distances and spatial distances, we found that network distance better explains the information propagation patterns between neurons, highlighting the importance of topological structure in neural information processing. To facilitate these studies, we developed real-time 3D large spatial network visualization software, bridging a crucial gap in existing tools. Our findings underscore the importance of network structure in neural activation and provide new insights into the fundamental principles governing brain functionality.</description>

      <title>Demixing fluorescence time traces transmitted by multimode fibers</title>

Abstract: Optical methods based on thin multimode fibers (MMFs) are promising tools for measuring neuronal activity in deep brain regions of freely moving mice thanks to their small diameter. However, current methods are limited: while fiber photometry provides only ensemble activity, imaging techniques using of long multimode fibers are very sensitive to bending and have not been applied to unrestrained rodents yet. Here, we demonstrate the fundamentals of a new approach using a short MMF coupled to a miniscope. In proof-of-principle in vitro experiments, we disentangled spatio-temporal fluorescence signals from multiple fluorescent sources transmitted by a thin (200 \mu m) and short (8 mm) MMF, using a general unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization algorithm directly on the raw video data. Furthermore, we show that low-cost open-source miniscopes have sufficient sensitivity to image the same fluorescence patterns seen in our proof-of-principle experiment, suggesting a new avenue for novel minimally invasive deep brain studies using multimode fibers in freely behaving mice.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Approach to Multi-scale Brain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale differentiable brain modeling workflow utilizing BrainPy, a unique differentiable brain simulator that combines accurate brain simulation with powerful gradient-based optimization. We leverage this capability of BrainPy across different brain scales. At the single-neuron level, we implement differentiable neuron models and employ gradient methods to optimize their fit to electrophysiological data. On the network level, we incorporate connectomic data to construct biologically constrained network models. Finally, to replicate animal behavior, we train these models on cognitive tasks using gradient-based learning rules. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance and speed in fitting generalized leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley single neuron models. Additionally, training a biologically-informed network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons on working memory tasks successfully replicates observed neural activity and synaptic weight distributions. Overall, our differentiable multi-scale simulation approach offers a promising tool to bridge neuroscience data across electrophysiological, anatomical, and behavioral scales.</description>
