      <title>Rising Rested Bandits: Lower Bounds and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is in the field of stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs), i.e. those sequential selection techniques able to learn online using only the feedback given by the chosen option (a.k.a. $arm$). We study a particular case of the rested bandits in which the arms' expected reward is monotonically non-decreasing and concave. We study the inherent sample complexity of the regret minimization problem by deriving suitable regret lower bounds. Then, we design an algorithm for the rested case $\textit{R-ed-UCB}$, providing a regret bound depending on the properties of the instance and, under certain circumstances, of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. We empirically compare our algorithms with state-of-the-art methods for non-stationary MABs over several synthetically generated tasks and an online model selection problem for a real-world dataset</description>

      <title>Sparsifying Suprema of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a dimension-independent sparsification result for suprema of centered Gaussian processes: Let $T$ be any (possibly infinite) bounded set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $\{{\boldsymbol{X}}_t\}_{t\in T}$ be the canonical Gaussian process on $T$. We show that there is an $O_\varepsilon(1)$-size subset $S \subseteq T$ and a set of real values $\{c_s\}_{s \in S}$ such that $\sup_{s \in S} \{{\boldsymbol{X}}_s + c_s\}$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximator of $\sup_{t \in T} {\boldsymbol{X}}_t$. Notably, the size of $S$ is completely independent of both the size of $T$ and of the ambient dimension $n$.
  We use this to show that every norm is essentially a junta when viewed as a function over Gaussian space: Given any norm $\nu(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is another norm $\psi(x)$ which depends only on the projection of $x$ along $O_\varepsilon(1)$ directions, for which $\psi({\boldsymbol{g}})$ is a multiplicative $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of $\nu({\boldsymbol{g}})$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$ for ${\boldsymbol{g}} \sim N(0,I_n)$.
  We also use our sparsification result for suprema of centered Gaussian processes to give a sparsification lemma for convex sets of bounded geometric width: Any intersection of (possibly infinitely many) halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are at distance $O(1)$ from the origin is $\varepsilon$-close, under $N(0,I_n)$, to an intersection of only $O_\varepsilon(1)$ many halfspaces.
  We describe applications to agnostic learning and tolerant property testing.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning for Adaptive Causal Representation in High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive causal representation learning from observational data is presented, integrated with an efficient sample splitting technique within the semiparametric estimating equation framework. The support points sample splitting (SPSS), a subsampling method based on energy distance, is employed for efficient double machine learning (DML) in causal inference. The support points are selected and split as optimal representative points of the full raw data in a random sample, in contrast to the traditional random splitting, and providing an optimal sub-representation of the underlying data generating distribution. They offer the best representation of a full big dataset, whereas the unit structural information of the underlying distribution via the traditional random data splitting is most likely not preserved. Three machine learning estimators were adopted for causal inference, support vector machine (SVM), deep learning (DL), and a hybrid super learner (SL) with deep learning (SDL), using SPSS. A comparative study is conducted between the proposed SVM, DL, and SDL representations using SPSS, and the benchmark results from Chernozhukov et al. (2018), which employed random forest, neural network, and regression trees with a random k-fold cross-fitting technique on the 401(k)-pension plan real data. The simulations show that DL with SPSS and the hybrid methods of DL and SL with SPSS outperform SVM with SPSS in terms of computational efficiency and the estimation quality, respectively.</description>

      <title>Iterative Reweighted Framework Based Algorithms for Sparse Linear Regression with Generalized Elastic Net Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic net penalty is frequently employed in high-dimensional statistics for parameter regression and variable selection. It is particularly beneficial compared to lasso when the number of predictors greatly surpasses the number of observations. However, empirical evidence has shown that the $\ell_q$-norm penalty (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) often provides better regression compared to the $\ell_1$-norm penalty, demonstrating enhanced robustness in various scenarios. In this paper, we explore a generalized elastic net model that employs a $\ell_r$-norm (where $r \geq 1$) in loss function to accommodate various types of noise, and employs a $\ell_q$-norm (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) to replace the $\ell_1$-norm in elastic net penalty. Theoretically, we establish the computable lower bounds for the nonzero entries of the generalized first-order stationary points of the proposed generalized elastic net model. For implementation, we develop two efficient algorithms based on the locally Lipschitz continuous $\epsilon$-approximation to $\ell_q$-norm. The first algorithm employs an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while the second utilizes a proximal majorization-minimization method (PMM), where the subproblems are addressed using the semismooth Newton method (SNN). We also perform extensive numerical experiments with both simulated and real data, showing that both algorithms demonstrate superior performance. Notably, the PMM-SSN is efficient than ADMM, even though the latter provides a simpler implementation.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent rates for structured neural density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks achieve dimension-independent rates of convergence for learning structured densities such as those arising in image, audio, video, and text applications. More precisely, we demonstrate that neural networks with a simple $L^2$-minimizing loss achieve a rate of $n^{-1/(4+r)}$ in nonparametric density estimation when the underlying density is Markov to a graph whose maximum clique size is at most $r$, and we provide evidence that in the aforementioned applications, this size is typically constant, i.e., $r=O(1)$. We then establish that the optimal rate in $L^1$ is $n^{-1/(2+r)}$ which, compared to the standard nonparametric rate of $n^{-1/(2+d)}$, reveals that the effective dimension of such problems is the size of the largest clique in the Markov random field. These rates are independent of the data's ambient dimension, making them applicable to realistic models of image, sound, video, and text data. Our results provide a novel justification for deep learning's ability to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, demonstrating dimension-independent convergence rates in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based optimization for variational empirical Bayes multiple regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational empirical Bayes (VEB) methods provide a practically attractive approach to fitting large, sparse, multiple regression models. These methods usually use coordinate ascent to optimize the variational objective function, an approach known as coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI). Here we propose alternative optimization approaches based on gradient-based (quasi-Newton) methods, which we call gradient-based variational inference (GradVI). GradVI exploits a recent result from Kim et. al. [arXiv:2208.10910] which writes the VEB regression objective function as a penalized regression. Unfortunately the penalty function is not available in closed form, and we present and compare two approaches to dealing with this problem. In simple situations where CAVI performs well, we show that GradVI produces similar predictive performance, and GradVI converges in fewer iterations when the predictors are highly correlated. Furthermore, unlike CAVI, the key computations in GradVI are simple matrix-vector products, and so GradVI is much faster than CAVI in settings where the design matrix admits fast matrix-vector products (e.g., as we show here, trendfiltering applications) and lends itself to parallelized implementations in ways that CAVI does not. GradVI is also very flexible, and could exploit automatic differentiation to easily implement different prior families. Our methods are implemented in an open-source Python software, GradVI (available from https://github.com/stephenslab/gradvi ).</description>

      <title>Summarizing Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture Posterior -- Sliced Optimal Transport Metrics for Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14674v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods to summarize posterior inference for mixture models focus on identifying a point estimate of the implied random partition for clustering, with density estimation as a secondary goal (Wade and Ghahramani, 2018; Dahl et al., 2022). We propose a novel approach for summarizing posterior inference in nonparametric Bayesian mixture models, prioritizing density estimation of the mixing measure (or mixture) as an inference target. One of the key features is the model-agnostic nature of the approach, which remains valid under arbitrarily complex dependence structures in the underlying sampling model. Using a decision-theoretic framework, our method identifies a point estimate by minimizing posterior expected loss. A loss function is defined as a discrepancy between mixing measures. Estimating the mixing measure implies inference on the mixture density and the random partition. Exploiting the discrete nature of the mixing measure, we use a version of sliced Wasserstein distance. We introduce two specific variants for Gaussian mixtures. The first, mixed sliced Wasserstein, applies generalized geodesic projections on the product of the Euclidean space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. The second, sliced mixture Wasserstein, leverages the linearity of Gaussian mixture measures for efficient projection.</description>

      <title>Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS): Active inference with interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Speedup of Personalized Federated Reinforcement Learning with Shared Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables multiple agents to collaboratively learn a policy without sharing their local trajectories collected during agent-environment interactions. However, in practice, the environments faced by different agents are often heterogeneous, leading to poor performance by the single policy learned by existing FedRL algorithms on individual agents. In this paper, we take a further step and introduce a \emph{personalized} FedRL framework (PFedRL) by taking advantage of possibly shared common structure among agents in heterogeneous environments. Specifically, we develop a class of PFedRL algorithms named PFedRL-Rep that learns (1) a shared feature representation collaboratively among all agents, and (2) an agent-specific weight vector personalized to its local environment. We analyze the convergence of PFedTD-Rep, a particular instance of the framework with temporal difference (TD) learning and linear representations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a linear convergence speedup with respect to the number of agents in the PFedRL setting. To achieve this, we show that PFedTD-Rep is an example of the federated two-timescale stochastic approximation with Markovian noise. Experimental results demonstrate that PFedTD-Rep, along with an extension to the control setting based on deep Q-networks (DQN), not only improve learning in heterogeneous settings, but also provide better generalization to new environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1804.04780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays more and more data are gathered for detecting and preventing cyber attacks. In cyber security applications, data analytics techniques have to deal with active adversaries that try to deceive the data analytics models and avoid being detected. The existence of such adversarial behavior motivates the development of robust and resilient adversarial learning techniques for various tasks. Most of the previous work focused on adversarial classification techniques, which assumed the existence of a reasonably large amount of carefully labeled data instances. However, in practice, labeling the data instances often requires costly and time-consuming human expertise and becomes a significant bottleneck. Meanwhile, a large number of unlabeled instances can also be used to understand the adversaries' behavior. To address the above mentioned challenges, in this paper, we develop a novel grid based adversarial clustering algorithm. Our adversarial clustering algorithm is able to identify the core normal regions, and to draw defensive walls around the centers of the normal objects utilizing game theoretic ideas. Our algorithm also identifies sub-clusters of attack objects, the overlapping areas within clusters, and outliers which may be potential anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present and study Continuous Generative Neural Networks (CGNNs), namely, generative models in the continuous setting: the output of a CGNN belongs to an infinite-dimensional function space. The architecture is inspired by DCGAN, with one fully connected layer, several convolutional layers and nonlinear activation functions. In the continuous $L^2$ setting, the dimensions of the spaces of each layer are replaced by the scales of a multiresolution analysis of a compactly supported wavelet. We present conditions on the convolutional filters and on the nonlinearity that guarantee that a CGNN is injective. This theory finds applications to inverse problems, and allows for deriving Lipschitz stability estimates for (possibly nonlinear) infinite-dimensional inverse problems with unknowns belonging to the manifold generated by a CGNN. Several numerical simulations, including signal deblurring, illustrate and validate this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a measure quantization procedure i.e., an algorithm which finds the best approximation of a target probability law (and more generally signed finite variation measure) by a sum of $Q$ Dirac masses ($Q$ being the quantization parameter). The procedure is implemented by minimizing the statistical distance between the original measure and its quantized version; the distance is built from a negative definite kernel and, if necessary, can be computed on the fly and feed to a stochastic optimization algorithm (such as SGD, Adam, ...). We investigate theoretically the fundamental questions of existence of the optimal measure quantizer and identify what are the required kernel properties that guarantee suitable behavior. We propose two best linear unbiased (BLUE) estimators for the squared statistical distance and use them in an unbiased procedure, called HEMQ, to find the optimal quantization. We test HEMQ on several databases: multi-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, Wiener space cubature, Italian wine cultivars and the MNIST image database. The results indicate that the HEMQ algorithm is robust and versatile and, for the class of Huber-energy kernels, matches the expected intuitive behavior.</description>

      <title>How Sparse Can We Prune A Deep Network: A Fundamental Limit Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05857</link>

Abstract: Network pruning is a commonly used measure to alleviate the storage and computational burden of deep neural networks. However, the fundamental limit of network pruning is still lacking. To close the gap, in this work we'll take a first-principles approach, i.e. we'll directly impose the sparsity constraint on the loss function and leverage the framework of statistical dimension in convex geometry, thus we're able to characterize the sharp phase transition point, i.e. the fundamental limit of the pruning ratio. Through this limit, we're able to identify two key factors that determine the pruning ratio limit, namely, weight magnitude and network sharpness. Generally speaking, the flatter the loss landscape or the smaller the weight magnitude, the smaller pruning ratio. Moreover, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in the computation of the pruning limit, which involves accurate spectrum estimation of a large-scale and non-positive Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we can provide rigorous interpretations on several heuristics in existing pruning algorithms. Extensive experiments are performed that demonstrate that our theoretical pruning ratio threshold coincides very well with the experiments.

      <title>Random Fourier Signature Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor algebras give rise to one of the most powerful measures of similarity for sequences of arbitrary length called the signature kernel accompanied with attractive theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. Previous algorithms to compute the signature kernel scale quadratically in terms of the length and the number of the sequences. To mitigate this severe computational bottleneck, we develop a random Fourier feature-based acceleration of the signature kernel acting on the inherently non-Euclidean domain of sequences. We show uniform approximation guarantees for the proposed unbiased estimator of the signature kernel, while keeping its computation linear in the sequence length and number. In addition, combined with recent advances on tensor projections, we derive two even more scalable time series features with favourable concentration properties and computational complexity both in time and memory. Our empirical results show that the reduction in computational cost comes at a negligible price in terms of accuracy on moderate-sized datasets, and it enables one to scale to large datasets up to a million time series.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemic Spread: A Gaussian Process Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling epidemic spread is critical for informing policy decisions aimed at mitigation. Accordingly, in this work we present a new data-driven method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model epidemic spread through the difference on the logarithmic scale of the infected cases. We bound the variance of the predictions made by GPR, which quantifies the impact of epidemic data on the proposed model. Next, we derive a high-probability error bound on the prediction error in terms of the distance between the training points and a testing point, the posterior variance, and the level of change in the spreading process, and we assess how the characteristics of the epidemic spread and infection data influence this error bound. We present examples that use GPR to model and predict epidemic spread by using real-world infection data gathered in the UK during the COVID-19 epidemic. These examples illustrate that, under typical conditions, the prediction for the next twenty days has 94.29% of the noisy data located within the 95% confidence interval, validating these predictions. We further compare the modeling and prediction results with other methods, such as polynomial regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and neural networks, to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging GPR in disease spread modeling.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Two-Sample Testing under Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the trade-off between privacy and statistical utility in private two-sample testing under local differential privacy (LDP) for both multinomial and continuous data. We begin by addressing the multinomial case, where we introduce private permutation tests using practical privacy mechanisms such as Laplace, discrete Laplace, and Google's RAPPOR. We then extend our multinomial approach to continuous data via binning and study its uniform separation rates under LDP over H\"older and Besov smoothness classes. The proposed tests for both discrete and continuous cases rigorously control the type I error for any finite sample size, strictly adhere to LDP constraints, and achieve minimax separation rates under LDP. The attained minimax rates reveal inherent privacy-utility trade-offs that are unavoidable in private testing. To address scenarios with unknown smoothness parameters in density testing, we propose an adaptive test based on a Bonferroni-type approach that ensures robust performance without prior knowledge of the smoothness parameters. We validate our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments and demonstrate the practical relevance and effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Generative Hybrid Model to Integrate Multimodal and Dynamic Connectivity for Predicting Spectrum-Level Deficits in Autism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an integrated deep-generative framework, that jointly models complementary information from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to extract predictive biomarkers of a disease. The generative part of our framework is a structurally-regularized Dynamic Dictionary Learning (sr-DDL) model that decomposes the dynamic rs-fMRI correlation matrices into a collection of shared basis networks and time varying patient-specific loadings. This matrix factorization is guided by the DTI tractography matrices to learn anatomically informed connectivity profiles. The deep part of our framework is an LSTM-ANN block, which models the temporal evolution of the patient sr-DDL loadings to predict multidimensional clinical severity. Our coupled optimization procedure collectively estimates the basis networks, the patient-specific dynamic loadings, and the neural network weights. We validate our framework on a multi-score prediction task in 57 patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our hybrid model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in a five-fold cross validated setting and extracts interpretable multimodal neural signatures of brain dysfunction in ASD.</description>

      <title>A Joint Network Optimization Framework to Predict Clinical Severity from Resting State Functional MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework to predict clinical severity from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Our model consists of two coupled terms. The first term decomposes the correlation matrices into a sparse set of representative subnetworks that define a network manifold. These subnetworks are modeled as rank-one outer-products which correspond to the elemental patterns of co-activation across the brain; the subnetworks are combined via patient-specific non-negative coefficients. The second term is a linear regression model that uses the patient-specific coefficients to predict a measure of clinical severity. We validate our framework on two separate datasets in a ten fold cross validation setting. The first is a cohort of fifty-eight patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second dataset consists of sixty three patients from a publicly available ASD database. Our method outperforms standard semi-supervised frameworks, which employ conventional graph theoretic and statistical representation learning techniques to relate the rs-fMRI correlations to behavior. In contrast, our joint network optimization framework exploits the structure of the rs-fMRI correlation matrices to simultaneously capture group level effects and patient heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed framework robustly identifies clinically relevant networks characteristic of ASD.</description>

      <title>Discrete Latent Structure in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many types of data from fields including natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics, are well represented by discrete, compositional structures such as trees, sequences, or matchings. Latent structure models are a powerful tool for learning to extract such representations, offering a way to incorporate structural bias, discover insight about the data, and interpret decisions. However, effective training is challenging, as neural networks are typically designed for continuous computation.
  This text explores three broad strategies for learning with discrete latent structure: continuous relaxation, surrogate gradients, and probabilistic estimation. Our presentation relies on consistent notations for a wide range of models. As such, we reveal many new connections between latent structure learning strategies, showing how most consist of the same small set of fundamental building blocks, but use them differently, leading to substantially different applicability and properties.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Safety Alignment for Large Language Models via Optimal Dualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing safety concerns surrounding large language models raise an urgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, typical Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a perspective of dualization that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based settings (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for predicting the effects of perturbations in single cells, designed to standardize benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field. Our framework, PerturBench, includes a user-friendly platform, diverse datasets, metrics for fair model comparison, and detailed performance analysis. Extensive evaluations of published and baseline models reveal limitations like mode or posterior collapse, and underscore the importance of rank metrics that assess the ordering of perturbations alongside traditional measures like RMSE. Our findings show that simple models can outperform more complex approaches. This benchmarking exercise sets new standards for model evaluation, supports robust model development, and advances the potential of these models to use high-throughput and high-content genetic and chemical screens for disease target discovery.</description>

      <title>Unveil Benign Overfitting for Transformer in Vision: Training Dynamics, Convergence, and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated great power in the recent development of large foundational models. In particular, the Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought revolutionary changes to the field of vision, achieving significant accomplishments on the experimental side. However, their theoretical capabilities, particularly in terms of generalization when trained to overfit training data, are still not fully understood. To address this gap, this work delves deeply into the benign overfitting perspective of transformers in vision. To this end, we study the optimization of a Transformer composed of a self-attention layer with softmax followed by a fully connected layer under gradient descent on a certain data distribution model. By developing techniques that address the challenges posed by softmax and the interdependent nature of multiple weights in transformer optimization, we successfully characterized the training dynamics and achieved generalization in post-training. Our results establish a sharp condition that can distinguish between the small test error phase and the large test error regime, based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data model. The theoretical results are further verified by experimental simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to characterize benign overfitting for Transformers.</description>

      <title>Introducing Spectral Attention for Long-Range Dependency in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence modeling faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies across diverse tasks. Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have shown superior performance in time series forecasting. However, they are constrained by their inherent inability to effectively address long-range dependencies in time series data, primarily due to using fixed-size inputs for prediction. Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal correlation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into mini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective Spectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among samples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while maintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves long-period trends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between samples. Spectral Attention can be seamlessly integrated into most sequence models, allowing models with fixed-sized look-back windows to capture long-range dependencies over thousands of steps. Through extensive experiments on 11 real-world time series datasets using 7 recent forecasting models, we consistently demonstrate the efficacy of our Spectral Attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>ADOPT: Modified Adam Can Converge with Any $\beta_2$ with the Optimal Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. However, it is known that Adam does not converge in theory unless choosing a hyperparameter, i.e., $\beta_2$, in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix the non-convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the gradient noise is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any choice of $\beta_2$ without depending on the bounded noise assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum update and the normalization by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves superior results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/iShohei220/adopt.</description>

      <title>Language Models are Hidden Reasoners: Unlocking Latent Reasoning Capabilities via Self-Rewarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but still struggle with complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple steps. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can improve LLM reasoning at inference time, optimizing reasoning capabilities during training remains challenging. We introduce LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a principled framework that formulates reasoning as sampling from a latent distribution and optimizes it via variational approaches. LaTRO enables LLMs to concurrently improve both their reasoning process and ability to evaluate reasoning quality, without requiring external feedback or reward models. We validate LaTRO through experiments on GSM8K and ARC-Challenge datasets using multiple model architectures. On GSM8K, LaTRO improves zero-shot accuracy by an average of 12.5% over base models and 9.6% over supervised fine-tuning across Phi-3.5-mini, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B. Our findings suggest that pre-trained LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked and enhanced through our proposed optimization approach in a self-improvement manner. The code of LaTRO is available at \url{https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/LaTRO}.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Learning of Arbitrary ReLU Activation under Gaussian Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an arbitrarily-biased ReLU activation (or neuron) over Gaussian marginals with the squared loss objective. Despite the ReLU neuron being the basic building block of modern neural networks, we still do not understand the basic algorithmic question of whether one arbitrary ReLU neuron is learnable in the non-realizable setting. In particular, all existing polynomial time algorithms only provide approximation guarantees for the better-behaved unbiased setting or restricted bias setting.
  Our main result is a polynomial time statistical query (SQ) algorithm that gives the first constant factor approximation for arbitrary bias. It outputs a ReLU activation that achieves a loss of $O(\mathrm{OPT}) + \varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(d,1/\varepsilon)$, where $\mathrm{OPT}$ is the loss obtained by the optimal ReLU activation. Our algorithm presents an interesting departure from existing algorithms, which are all based on gradient descent and thus fall within the class of correlational statistical query (CSQ) algorithms. We complement our algorithmic result by showing that no polynomial time CSQ algorithm can achieve a constant factor approximation. Together, these results shed light on the intrinsic limitation of gradient descent, while identifying arguably the simplest setting (a single neuron) where there is a separation between SQ and CSQ algorithms.</description>
