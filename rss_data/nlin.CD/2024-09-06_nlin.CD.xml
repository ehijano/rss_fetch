      <title>Machine-aided guessing and gluing of unstable periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) are believed to be the underlying dynamical structures of spatio-temporal chaos and turbulence. Finding these UPOs is however notoriously difficult. Matrix-free loop convergence algorithms deform entire space-time fields (loops) until they satisfy the evolution equations. Initial guesses for these robust variational convergence algorithms are thus periodic space-time fields in a high-dimensional state space, rendering their generation highly challenging. Usually guesses are generated with recurrency methods, which are most suited to shorter and more stable periodic orbits. Here we propose an alternative, data-driven method for generating initial guesses: while the dimension of the space used to discretize fluid flows is prohibitively large to construct suitable initial guesses, the dissipative dynamics will collapse onto a chaotic attractor of far lower dimension. We use an autoencoder to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the discretized physical space for the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation, in chaotic and hyperchaotic regimes. In this low-dimensional latent space, we construct loops based on the latent POD modes with random periodic coefficients, which are then decoded to physical space and used as initial guesses. These loops are found to be realistic initial guesses and, together with variational convergence algorithms, these guesses help us to quickly converge to UPOs. We further attempt to 'glue' known UPOs in the latent space to create guesses for longer ones. This gluing procedure is successful and points towards a hierarchy of UPOs where longer UPOs shadow sequences of shorter ones.</description>

      <title>Disruption of exo-asteroids around white dwarfs and the release of dust particles in debris rings in co-orbital motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to the Roche radius of a white dwarf (WD), an asteroid on a circular orbit sheds material that then adopts a very similar orbit. Observations of the resulting debris show a periodic behavior and changes in flux on short timescales, implying ongoing dynamical activity. Additional encounters from other minor planets may then yield co-orbital rings of debris at different inclinations. The structure, dynamics, and lifetime of these debris discs remains highly uncertain, but is important for understanding WD planetary systems. We aim to identify and quantify the locations of co-orbitals in WD-asteroid-dust particle 3-body systems by exploring the influence of 1:1 resonant periodic orbits. We begin this exploration with co-planar and inclined orbits in the circular restricted 3-body problem (CRTBP) and model the dynamical evolution of these exosystems over observable timescales. The mass ratio parameter for this class of systems ($~2\times 10^{-11}$) is one of the lowest ever explored in this dynamical configuration. We computed the periodic orbits, deduced their linear stability, and suitably seeded the dynamical stability maps. We carried out a limited suite of N-body simulations to provide direct comparisons with the maps. We derive novel results for this extreme mass ratio in the CRTBP, including new unstable 3D families. We illustrate through the maps and N-body simulations where dust can exist in a stable configuration over observable timescales across a wide expanse of parameter space in the absence of strong external forces. Over a timescale of 10 yr, the maximum orbital period deviations of stable debris due to the co-orbital perturbations of the asteroid is about a few seconds. Unstable debris in a close encounter with the asteroid typically deviates from the co-orbital configuration by more than about 20 km and is on a near-circular orbit with an eccentricity lower than ~0.01.</description>

      <title>Continuation and bifurcations of periodic orbits and symbolic dynamics in the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady states of the Swift--Hohenberg equation are studied. For the associated four--dimensional ODE we prove that on the energy level $E=0$ two smooth branches of even periodic solutions are created through the saddle-node bifurcation. We also show that these orbits satisfy certain geometric properties, which implies that the system has positive topological entropy for an explicit and wide range of parameter values of the system.
  The proof is computer-assisted and it uses rigorous computation of bounds on certain Poincar\'e map and its higher order derivatives.</description>

      <title>OceanNet: A principled neural operator-based digital twin for regional oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While data-driven approaches demonstrate great potential in atmospheric modeling and weather forecasting, ocean modeling poses distinct challenges due to complex bathymetry, land, vertical structure, and flow non-linearity. This study introduces OceanNet, a principled neural operator-based digital twin for ocean circulation. OceanNet uses a Fourier neural operator and predictor-evaluate-corrector integration scheme to mitigate autoregressive error growth and enhance stability over extended time scales. A spectral regularizer counteracts spectral bias at smaller scales. OceanNet is applied to the northwest Atlantic Ocean western boundary current (the Gulf Stream), focusing on the task of seasonal prediction for Loop Current eddies and the Gulf Stream meander. Trained using historical sea surface height (SSH) data, OceanNet demonstrates competitive forecast skill by outperforming SSH predictions by an uncoupled, state-of-the-art dynamical ocean model forecast, reducing computation by 500,000 times. These accomplishments demonstrate the potential of physics-inspired deep neural operators as cost-effective alternatives to high-resolution numerical ocean models.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 1. Wavenumber interaction and Eckhaus instability in a narrow domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a vertical channel driven by an imposed horizontal temperature gradient, numerical simulations have previously shown steady, time-periodic and chaotic dynamics. We explore the observed dynamics by constructing invariant solutions of the three-dimensional Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations, characterizing the stability of these equilibria and periodic orbits, and following the bifurcation structure of the solution branches under parametric continuation in Rayleigh number. We find that in a narrow vertically-periodic domain of aspect ratio ten, the flow is dominated by the competition between three and four co-rotating rolls. We demonstrate that branches of three and four-roll equilibria are connected and can be understood in terms of their discrete symmetries. Specifically, the D4 symmetry of the four-roll branch dictates the existence of qualitatively different intermediate branches that themselves connect to the three-roll branch in a transcritical bifurcation due to D3 symmetry. The physical appearance, disappearance, merging and splitting of rolls along the connecting branch provide a physical and phenomenological illustration of the equivariant theory of D3-D4 mode interaction. We observe other manifestations of the competition between three and four rolls, in which the symmetry in time or in the transverse direction is broken, leading to limit cycles or wavy rolls, respectively. Our work highlights the interest of combining numerical simulations, bifurcation theory, and group theory, in order to understand the transitions between and origin of flow patterns.</description>
