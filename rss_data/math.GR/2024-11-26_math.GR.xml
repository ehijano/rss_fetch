      <title>Which reducible representations are Anosov?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the Anosov condition for reducible representations in terms of the eigenvalue magnitudes of the irreducible block factors of its block diagonalization. As in previous work, these Anosov representations comprise a collection of bounded convex domains in a finite-dimensional vector space, and this perspective allows us to conclude for many non-elementary hyperbolic groups that connected components of the character variety which consist entirely of Anosov representations do not contain reducible representations.</description>

      <title>Graphical models for topological groups: A case study on countable Stone spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analogy with the Cayley graph of a group with respect to a finite generating set or the Cayley-Abels graph of a totally disconnected, locally compact group, we introduce countable connected graphs associated to Polish groups that we term Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graphs. A group admitting a Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graph acts on it continuously, coarsely metrically properly and cocompactly by isometries of the path metric. By an expansion of the Milnor-Schwarz lemma, it follows that the group is generated by a coarsely bounded set and the group equipped with (a suitably compatible alteration of) a word metric with respect to a coarsely bounded generating set and the graph are quasi-isometric. In other words, groups admitting Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graphs are topological analogues of the finitely generated groups. Our goal is to introduce this topological perspective to a geometric group theorist.
  We apply these concepts to homeomorphism groups of countable Stone spaces. We completely characterize when these homeomorphism groups are coarsely bounded, when they are locally bounded (all of them are), and when they admit a Cayley-Abels-Rosendal graph, and if so produce a coarsely bounded generating set.</description>

      <title>2-dimensional Shephard groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2-dimensional Shephard groups are quotients of 2-dimensional Artin groups by powers of standard generators. We show that such a quotient is not $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ if the powers taken are sufficiently large. However, for a given 2-dimensional Shephard group, we construct a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ piecewise Euclidean cell complex with a cocompact action (analogous to the Deligne complex for an Artin group) that allows us to determine other non-positive curvature properties. Namely, we show the 2-dimensional Shephard groups are acylindrically hyperbolic (which was known for 2-dimensional Artin groups), and relatively hyperbolic (which most Artin groups are known not to be). As an application, we show that a broad class of 2-dimensional Artin groups are residually finite.</description>

      <title>Edge zeta function and closed cycles in the standard non-uniform complex from $\operatorname{PGL}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the edge zeta function of weighted complex. We also present the formula for the edge zeta function of the standard non-uniform complex $\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[t])\backslash\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q(\!(t^{-1})\!))/\operatorname{PGL}(3,\mathbb{F}_q[\![t^{-1}]\!])$, arising from the group $\operatorname{PGL}_3$, as a rational function. Applying trunction in a specific direction is one of the main ingredient. As a result, we obtain the exact formula for the number of closed cycles coming from geodesics in the building.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The palindromic automorphism group is a subgroup of the automorphism group $Aut(F_3).$ We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix in $GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ representing a palindromic automorphism of $F_n.$ We prove that the number of the $z$-classes in $\Pi A(F_n)$ is infinite. We further classify the conjugacy classes of the reducible palindromic automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Small monoids generating varieties with uncountably many subvarieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algebra that generates a variety with uncountably many subvarieties is said to be of type $2^{\aleph_0}$. We show that the Rees quotient monoid $M(aabb)$ of order ten is of type $2^{\aleph_0}$, thereby affirmatively answering a recent question of Glasson. As a corollary, we exhibit a new example of type $2^{\aleph_0}$ monoid of order six, which turns out to be minimal and the first of its kind that is finitely based.</description>

      <title>Ordering groups and the Identity Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Identity Problem for certain groups, which asks if the subsemigroup generated by a given finite set of elements contains the identity element, is related to problems regarding ordered groups. Notably, the Identity Problem for a torsion-free nilpotent group corresponds to the problem asking if a given finite set of elements extends to the positive cone of a left-order on the group, and thereby also to the Word Problem for a related lattice-ordered group.
  A new (independent) proof is given showing that the Identity and Subgroup Problems are decidable for every finitely presented nilpotent group, establishing also the decidability of the Word Problem for a family of lattice-ordered groups. A related problem, the Fixed-Target Submonoid Membership Problem, is shown to be undecidable in nilpotent groups.
  Decidability of the Normal Identity Problem (with `subsemigroup' replaced by `normal subsemigroup') for free nilpotent groups is established using the (known) decidability of the Word Problem for certain lattice-ordered groups. Connections between orderability and the Identity Problem for a class of torsion-free metabelian groups are also explored.</description>

      <title>On the metric dimension of the character degree graph of a solvable group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite solvable group and let $\Delta(G)$ be the character degree graph of $G$. In this paper, we obtain the metric dimension of certain character degree graphs. Specifically, we calculate the metric dimension for a regular character degree graph, a character degree graph with a diameter of $2$ that is not a block, a character degree graph with a diameter of $3$ that also has a cut vertex and a character degree graph with Fitting height $2.$ We also consider two related parameters, base size and adjacency dimension, and their relation to metric dimension for character degree graphs of solvable groups.</description>

      <title>Near-factorizations of dihedral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate near-factorizations of nonabelian groups, concentrating on dihedral groups. We show that some known constructions of near-factorizations in dihedral groups yield equivalent near-factorizations. In fact, there are very few known examples of nonequivalent near-factorizations in dihedral or other nonabelian groups; we provide some new examples with the aid of the computer. We also analyse a construction for near-factorizations in dihedral groups from near-factorizations in cyclic groups, due to P\^{e}cher, and we investigate when nonequivalent near-factorizations can be obtained by this method.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and explicit computation of mates in near-factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a "mate'' $B$ of a set $A$ in a near-factorization $(A,B)$ of a finite group $G$ is unique. Further, we describe how to compute the mate $B$ very efficiently using an explicit formula for $B$. We use this approach to give an alternate proof of a theorem of Wu, Yang and Feng, which states that a strong circular external difference family cannot have more than two sets. We prove some new structural properties of near-factorizations in certain classes of groups. Then we examine all the noncyclic abelian groups of order less than $200$ in a search for a possible nontrivial near-factorization. All of these possibilities are ruled out, either by theoretical criteria or by exhaustive computer searches. (In contrast, near-factorizations in cyclic or dihedral groups are known to exist by previous results.) We also look briefly at nontrivial near-factorizations of index $\lambda &gt; 1$ in noncyclic abelian groups. Various examples are found with $\lambda = 2$ by computer.</description>

      <title>Character degrees and local subgroups revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $q$ be different primes and let $G$ be a finite $q$-solvable group. We prove that $\mathrm{Irr}_{p'}(G)\subseteq \mathrm{Irr}_{q'}(G)$ if and only if $\mathbf{N}_G(P)\subseteq \mathbf{N}_G(Q)$ and $\mathbf{C}_{Q'}(P)=1$ for some $P\in\mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$ and $Q\in\mathrm{Syl}_q(G)$. Further, if $B$ is a $q$-block of $G$ and $p$ does not divide the degree of any character in $\mathrm{Irr}(B)$ then we prove that a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ is normalized by a defect group of $B$. This removes the $p$-solvability condition of two theorems of G. Navarro and T. R. Wolf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a discrete, countable, and amenable group $G$, if the direct product $G^2=G \times G$ is finitely colored then $\{ g \in G : \text{exists } (x,y) \in G^2 \text{ such that } \{ (x,y),(xg,y),(xg,yg)\} \text{ is monochromatic} \}$, is left IP$^{\ast}$. This partially solves a conjecture of V. Bergelson and R. McCutcheon. Moreover, we prove that the result holds for $G^m$ if $G$ is an FC-group, i.e., all conjugacy classes of $G$ are finite.</description>

      <title>Answering Five Open Problems Involving Semigroup Conjugacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semigroup conjugacy is an equivalence relation that equals group conjugacy when the semigroup is a group. In this note, we answer five open problems related to semigroup conjugacy. (Problem One) We say a conjugacy ~ is partition-covering if for every set X and every partition of the set, there exists a semigroup with universe X such that the partition gives the ~-conjugacy classes of the semigroup. We prove that six well-studied conjugacy relations -- ~o, ~c, ~n, ~p, ~p*, and ~tr -- are all partition-covering. (Problem Two) For two semigroup elements a and b in S, we say a ~p b if there exists u and v in S such that a=uv and b=vu. We give an example of a semigroup that is embeddable in a group for which ~p is not transitive. (Problem Three) We construct an infinite chain of first-order definable semigroup conjugacies. (Problem Four) We construct a semigroup for which ~o is a congruence and S\~o is not cancellative. (Problem Five) We construct a semigroup for which ~p is not transitive while, for each of the semigroup's variants, ~p is transitive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study some families of groups whose irreducible characters take values on quadratic extensions of the rationals. We focus mostly on a generalization of inverse semi-rational groups, which we call uniformly semi-rational groups. Moreover, we associate to every finite group two invariants, called rationality and semi-rationality of the group. They measure respectively how far a group is from being rational and how much uniformly rational it is. We determine the possible values that these invariants may take for finite nilpotent groups. We also classify the fields that can occur as the field generated by the character values of a finite nilpotent group.</description>

      <title>On the Hochschild Cohomology for Frobenius Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the authors investigate the structure of the Hochschild cohomology for Frobenius kernels. The authors first establish some fundamental constructions to compute Hochschild cohomology by using spectral sequences. This enables us to provide a complete description of the $G$-algebra structure of the Hochschild cohomology for the first Frobenius kernel $G_{1}$ where $G=SL_{2}$. This computation heavily relies on the calculation of the adjoint action on the restricted enveloping algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $M$ is a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle, the fundamental group of $M$ acts faithfully by homeomorphisms on a circle (the circle at infinity of the universal cover of the fiber), preserving a pair of invariant (stable and unstable) laminations. Many different kinds of dynamical structures (e.g. taut foliations, quasigeodesic or pseudo-Anosov flows) are known to give rise to universal circles -- a circle with a faithful $\pi_1(M)$ action preserving a pair of invariant laminations -- and these universal circles play a key role in relating the dynamical structure to the geometry of $M$. In this paper we introduce the idea of zippers, which give a new and direct way to construct universal circles, streamlining the known constructions in many cases, and giving a host of new constructions in others. In particular, zippers (and their associated universal circles) may be constructed directly from uniform quasimorphisms or from uniform left orders.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators on crossed modules of Lie groups and categorical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a categorical solution $(\huaC, R)$ of the Yang-Baxter equation, i.e. $\huaC$ is a small category and $R: \huaC\times\huaC\lon\huaC\times\huaC$ is an invertible functor satisfying $$ (R\times\Id_\huaC)(\Id_\huaC\times R)(R\times\Id_\huaC)=(\Id_\huaC\times R)(R\times\Id_\huaC)(\Id_\huaC\times R),
  $$ where $\huaC\times\huaC$ is the product category. First, the notion of Rota-Baxter operators on crossed modules of Lie groups is defined and its various properties are established. Then, we use Rota-Baxter operators on crossed modules of Lie groups to construct categorical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also study the Rota-Baxter operators on crossed modules of Lie algebras which are infinitesimals of Rota-Baxter operators on crossed modules of Lie groups, they can give connections on manifolds. Finally, we study the integration of Rota-Baxter operators on crossed modules of Lie algebras and the differentials of Rota-Baxter operators on crossed modules of Lie groups.</description>

      <title>On the number of small Steiner triple systems with Veblen points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of Schreier extensions of loops was introduced in the general case in [11] and, more recently, it has been explored in the context of Steiner loops in [6]. In the latter case, it gives a powerful method for constructing Steiner triple systems containing Veblen points. Counting all Steiner triple systems of order v is an open problem for v&gt;21. In this paper, we investigate the number of Steiner triple systems of order 19, 27 and 31 containing Veblen points and we present some examples.</description>

      <title>Lifting Polynomial Representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ from $\mathbb{F}_p$ to $\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe all of the basic $\mathbb{F}_p\mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations which lift to $\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}$ representations for $s&gt;1$, observing that they almost never do. We also show that two related indecomposable $\mathbb{F}_p \mathrm{SL}_2(p^r)$ representations cannot be lifted to $\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}$ representations for $s&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic functions on geometrically finite quotients of the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete and torsion-free subgroup of $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$, the group of biholomorphisms of the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, denoted by $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}$. We show that if $\Gamma$ is Abelian, then $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is a Stein manifold. If the critical exponent $\delta(\Gamma)$ of $\Gamma$ is less than 2, a conjecture of Dey and Kapovich predicts that the quotient $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is Stein. We confirm this conjecture in the case where $\Gamma$ is parabolic or geometrically finite. We also study the case of quotients with $\delta(\Gamma)=2$ that contain compact complex curves and confirm another conjecture of Dey and Kapovich. We finally show that $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is Stein when $\Gamma$ is a parabolic or geometrically finite group preserving a totally real and totally geodesic submanifold of $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}$, without any hypothesis on the critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Ample groupoids, topological full groups, algebraic K-theory spectra and infinite loop spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by work of Szymik and Wahl on the homology of Higman-Thompson groups, we establish a general connection between ample groupoids, topological full groups, algebraic K-theory spectra and infinite loop spaces, based on the construction of small permutative categories of compact open bisections. This allows us to analyse homological invariants of topological full groups in terms of homology for ample groupoids.
  Applications include complete rational computations, general vanishing and acyclicity results for group homology of topological full groups as well as a proof of Matui's AH-conjecture for all minimal, ample groupoids with comparison.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that every hyperbolic group is residually finite, we prove the congruence subgroup property for mapping class groups of hyperbolic surfaces of finite type. Under the same assumption, it follows that profinitely equivalent hyperbolic 3-manifolds are commensurable.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for checking equivalence of counting functions on free monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we propose a new algorithm for checking whether two counting functions on a free monoid $M_r$ of rank $r$ are equivalent modulo a bounded function. The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all ranks $r&gt;2$, however in case $r=2$ it was estimated only as $O(n^2)$. Here we apply a new approach, based on explicit basis expansion and weighted rectangles summation, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time complexity $O(n)$ for any $r\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Locally isotropic Steinberg groups I. Centrality of the $\mathrm K_2$-functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We begin to study Steinberg groups associated with a locally isotropic reductive group $G$ over a arbitrary ring. We propose a construction of such a Steinberg group functor as a group object in a certain completion of the category of presheaves. We also show that it is a crossed module over $G$ in a unique way, in particular, that the $\mathrm K_2$-functor is central. If $G$ is globally isotropic in a suitable sense, then the Steinberg group functor exists as an ordinary group-valued functor and all such abstract Steinberg groups are crossed modules over the groups of points of $G$.</description>

      <title>Edge subdivisions and the $L^2$-homology of right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $L$ is a flag triangulation of $S^{n-1}$, then the Davis complex $\Sigma_L$ for the associated right-angled Coxeter group $W_L$ is a contractible $n$-manifold. A special case of a conjecture of Singer predicts that the $L^2$-homology of such $\Sigma_L$ vanishes outside the middle dimension. We give conditions which guarantee this vanishing is preserved under edge subdivision of $L$. In particular, we verify Singer's conjecture when $L$ is the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of an $n$-simplex, and for general barycentric subdivisions of triangulations of $S^{2n-1}$. Using this, we construct explicit counterexamples to a torsion growth analogue of Singer's conjecture.</description>
