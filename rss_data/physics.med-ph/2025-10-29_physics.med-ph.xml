      <title>Photoacoustics on the go: An Embedded Photoacoustic Sensing Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several centimeters below the skin lie multiple biomarkers, such as glucose, oxygenation, and blood flow. Monitoring these biomarkers regularly and in a non-invasive manner would enable early insight into metabolic status and vascular health. Currently, there are only a handful of non-invasive monitoring systems. Optical methods offer molecular specificity (i.e., multi-biomarker monitoring) but have shallow reach (a few millimeters); ultrasound penetrates deeper but lacks specificity; and MRI is large, slow, and costly. Photoacoustic (PA) sensing combines the best of optical and ultrasound methods. A laser transmitter emits pulses that are absorbed by different molecules, providing specificity. These light pulses generate pressure changes that are captured by an ultrasound receiver, providing depth. Photoacoustic sensing is promising, but the current platforms are bulky, complex, and costly. We propose the first embedded PA platform. Our contributions are fourfold. First, inspired by LiDAR technology, we propose a novel transmitter that emits pulses similar to those in the state-of-the-art (SoA), but instead of using high-voltage sources and complex electronic interfaces, we use a simple low-power microcontroller (MCU). Second, we carry out a thorough analysis of our custom transmitter and a commercial system. Third, we build a basic ultrasound receiver that is able to process the faint signal generated by our transmitter. Lastly, we compare the performance of our platform against a SoA commercial system, and show that we can detect glucose and (de)oxygenated hemoglobin in two controlled solution studies. The resulting signal characteristics indicate a plausible path toward noninvasive, real-time, at-home sensing relevant to diabetes care. More broadly, this platform lays the groundwork for translating the promise of PA sensing into a broader practical reality.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model of Prompt Gamma Timing for Spatiotemporal Emission Reconstruction in Particle Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle therapy relies on up-to-date knowledge of the stopping power of the patient tissues to deliver the prescribed dose distribution. The stopping power describes the average particle motion, which is encoded in the distribution of prompt-gamma photon emissions in time and space. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal emission distribution from multi-detector Prompt Gamma Timing (PGT) data. Solving this inverse problem relies on an accurate model of the prompt-gamma transport and detection including explicitly the dependencies on the time of emission and detection. Our previous work relied on Monte-Carlo (MC) based system models. The tradeoff between computational resources and statistical noise in the system model prohibits studies of new detector arrangements and beam scanning scenarios. Therefore, we propose here an analytical system model to speed up recalculations for new beam positions and to avoid statistical noise in the model. We evaluated the model for the MERLINO multi-detector-PGT prototype. Comparisons between the analytical model and a MC-based reference showed excellent agreement for single-detector setups. When several detectors were placed close together and partially obstructed each other, intercrystal scatter led to differences of up to 10 % between the analytical and MC-based model. Nevertheless, when evaluating the performance in reconstructing the spatiotemporal distribution and estimating the stopping power, no significant difference between the models was observed. Hence, the procedure proved robust against the small inaccuracies of the model for the tested scenarios. The model calculation time was reduced by 1500 times, now enabling many new studies for PGT-based systems.</description>

      <title>General Microstructure Factor Analysis of Diffusion MRI in Gray-Matter Predicts Cognitive Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI has revealed important insights into white matter microstructure, but its application to gray matter remains comparatively less explored. Here, we investigate whether global patterns of gray-matter microstructure can be captured through neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and whether such patterns are predictive of cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based global indicators of gray-matter microstructure provide complementary markers of structure-function relationships, extending beyond region-specific analyses. Our results suggest that general microstructure factors may serve as robust, interpretable biomarkers for studying cognition and cortical organization at the population level. Using diffusion MRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study, we derived region-averaged NODDI parameters and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to construct general gray-matter microstructure factors. We found that the factor derived from isotropic volume fraction explained substantial inter-individual variability and was significantly correlated with specific cognitive scores collected from the NIH Toolbox. In particular, the isotropic volume fraction factor was linked to reading and vocabulary performance and to cognitive fluidity.</description>

      <title>Radiation enhanced diffusion in cartilages as a physical mechanism underlying radiation treatments of osteoarthritis and related disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</description>
