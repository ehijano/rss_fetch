      <title>Model Categories and the Higher Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new model structure on the category of dg presheaves over a topological space $X$, obtained through the right Bousfield localization of the local projective model structure. The motivation for this construction arises from the study of the homotopy theory underlying higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence theorems, as developed by Chuang, Holstein, and Lazarev.
  Let $X$ be a smooth manifold. We prove the existence of a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between the category of dg modules over the de Rham algebra and the category of dg presheaves of vector spaces over $X$. In the case where $X$ is a complex manifold, we obtain an analogous result, where the de Rham algebra is replaced by the Dolbeault algebra. In both settings, we equip the categories of modules with model structures of the second kind, whose homotopy categories are, in general, finer invariants than those given by quasi-isomorphisms.
  Finally, we introduce a singular analogue of this equivalence, stating it as a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between the category of dg contramodules over the singular cochain algebra $C^{*}(X)$ and dg presheaves. At the level of homotopy categories, this establishes an equivalence between the contraderived category of $C^{*}(X)$-contramodules and the homotopy category of dg presheaves.</description>

      <title>Higher local systems, $n$-affineness and Koszul duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories on spaces. We prove that categorical local systems are captured by (higher) monodromy data. We show that if $X$ is $(n+1)$-connected, local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories over $X$ can be described as $\mathbb{E}_{n}$-modules over the iterated loop space $\Omega^{n+1}_*X$. Our main result is a general statement of $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras of the form $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega^{n}_*X;\Bbbk) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$ when $X$ satisfies suitable connectedness and finiteness assumptions. This takes the shape of an equivalence of $(\infty,n)$-categories $n\mathbf{ShvCat}^{n-1}(\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))) \simeq n\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\Bbbk)$, where $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of the algebra of singular cochains, and $n\mathbf{ShvCat}^{n-1}$ is the $(\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures).</description>

      <title>Algebraic Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:1602.03501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Databases have been studied category-theoretically for decades. The database schema -- whose purpose is to arrange high-level conceptual entities -- is generally modeled as a category or sketch. The data itself, often called an instance, is generally modeled as a set-valued functor, assigning to each conceptual entity a set of examples. While mathematically elegant, these categorical models have typically struggled with representing concrete data such as integers or strings.
  In the present work, we propose an extension of the set-valued functor model, making use of multisorted algebraic theories (a.k.a. Lawvere theories) to incorporate concrete data in a principled way. This also allows constraints and queries to make use of operations on data, such as multiplication or comparison of numbers, helping to bridge the gap between traditional databases and programming languages.
  We also show how all of the components of our model -- including schemas, instances, change-of-schema functors, and queries - fit into a single double categorical structure called a proarrow equipment (a.k.a. framed bicategory).</description>

      <title>Duality for Clans: an Extension of Gabriel-Ulmer Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clans are representations of generalized algebraic theories that contain more information than the finite-limit categories associated to the locally finitely presentable categories of models via Gabriel-Ulmer duality. Extending Gabriel-Ulmer duality to account for this additional information, we present a duality theory between clans and locally finitely presentable categories equipped with a weak factorization system of a certain kind.</description>

      <title>Dual coalgebras of twisted tensor products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cases where the finite dual coalgebra of a twisted tensor product of two algebras is a cotwisted tensor product of their respective finite dual coalgebras. This is achieved by interpreting the finite dual as a topological dual; in order to prove this, we show that the continuous dual is a strong monoidal functor on linearly topologized vector spaces whose open subspaces have finite codimension. We describe a sufficient condition for the result on finite dual coalgebras to be applied, and we this condition to particular constructions including Ore extensions, smash product algebras, and crossed product bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <title>Non-linear microlocal cut-off functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To any conic closed set of a cotangent bundle, one can associate four functors on the category of sheaves, which are called non-linear microlocal cut-off functors. Here we explain their relation with the microlocal cut-off functor defined by Kashiwara and Schapira, and prove a microlocal cut-off lemma for non-linear microlocal cut-off functors, adapting inputs from symplectic geometry. We also prove two K\"unneth formulas and a functor classification result for categories of sheaves with microsupport conditions.</description>

      <title>Homotopy structures realizing algebraic kk-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic $kk$-theory, introduced by Corti\~nas and Thom, is a bivariant $K$-theory defined on the category $\mathrm{Alg}$ of algebras over a commutative unital ring $\ell$. It consists of a triangulated category $kk$ endowed with a functor from $\mathrm{Alg}$ to $kk$ that is the universal excisive, homotopy invariant and matrix-stable homology theory. Moreover, one can recover Weibel's homotopy $K$-theory $\mathrm{KH}$ from $kk$ since we have $kk(\ell,A)=\mathrm{KH}(A)$ for any algebra $A$. We prove that $\mathrm{Alg}$ with the split surjections as fibrations and the $kk$-equivalences as weak equivalences is a stable category of fibrant objects, whose homotopy category is $kk$. As a consecuence of this, we prove that the Dwyer-Kan localization $kk_\infty$ of the $\infty$-category of algebras at the set of $kk$-equivalences is a stable infinity category whose homotopy category is $kk$.</description>
