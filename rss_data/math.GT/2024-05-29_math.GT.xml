      <title>(Non-)existence of Cannon-Thurston maps for Morse boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Morse boundary exhibits interesting examples of both the existence and non-existence of Cannon-Thurston maps for normal subgroups, in contrast with the hyperbolic case.</description>

      <title>Rigidity on horocycles and hypercycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a bijection $f:\mathbb{H}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{H}^2$ of the hyperbolic plane that sends horocycles to horocycles (respectively hypercycles to hypercycles) is an isometry. This extends a previous result of J. Jeffers on geodesics to all curves with constant curvature in $\mathbb{H}^2$. We go beyond by showing that every abstract automorphism of the geodesic graph (respectively horocycles and hypercycles graphs) is induced by an earthquake map (respectively an isometry) of $\mathbb{H}^2$. This shadowed the difference between the geometry of geodesics and that of horocycles/hypercycles.</description>

      <title>Parametrised Poincar\'e duality and equivariant fixed points methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce and develop the notion of parametrised Poincar\'{e} duality in the formalism of parametrised higher category theory by Martini-Wolf, in part generalising Cnossen's theory of twisted ambidexterity to the nonpresentable setting. We prove several basechange results, allowing us to move between different coefficient categories and ambient topoi. We then specialise the general framework to yield a good theory of equivariant Poincar\'{e} duality spaces for compact Lie groups and apply our basechange results to obtain a suite of isotropy separation methods. Finally, we employ this theory to perform various categorical Smith-theoretic manoeuvres to prove, among other things, a generalisation of a theorem of Atiyah-Bott and Conner-Floyd on group actions with single fixed points.</description>

      <title>Modular functors from non-semisimple 3d TFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a not necessarily semisimple modular tensor category C, we use the corresponding 3d TFT defined in [arXiv:1912.02063] to explicitly describe a modular functor as a symmetric monoidal 2-functor from a 2-category of oriented bordisms to a 2-category of finite linear categories. This recovers a result by Lyubashenko [arXiv:hep-th/9405168] obtained via generators and relations. Pulling back the modular functor for C to a 2-category of bordisms with orientation reversing involution cancels the gluing anomaly, and further pulling back to the original bordism category along a doubling functor leads to the modular functor for the Drinfeld centre Z(C).</description>

      <title>Tight contact structures on hyperbolic homology 3-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce a large class of hyperbolic homology 3-spheres admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures. We also produce a sub-class admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures within the same homotopy class of oriented plane distributions. As a corollary, we give a recipe to construct hyperbolic L-spaces admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures. We also introduce a notion of geometric limits of contact structures compatible with geometric limits of hyperbolic manifolds and study the behavior of the tight contact structures we construct under geometric limits.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Topology and the Geometry of the Space of Persistence Diagrams via Optimal Partial Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.03048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the obvious similarities between the metrics used in topological data analysis and those of optimal transport, an optimal-transport based formalism to study persistence diagrams and similar topological descriptors has yet to come. In this article, by considering the space of persistence diagrams as a space of discrete measures, and by observing that its metrics can be expressed as optimal partial transport problems, we introduce a generalization of persistence diagrams, namely Radon measures supported on the upper half plane. Such measures naturally appear in topological data analysis when considering continuous representations of persistence diagrams (e.g.\ persistence surfaces) but also as limits for laws of large numbers on persistence diagrams or as expectations of probability distributions on the persistence diagrams space. We explore topological properties of this new space, which will also hold for the closed subspace of persistence diagrams. New results include a characterization of convergence with respect to Wasserstein metrics, a geometric description of barycenters (Fr\'echet means) for any distribution of diagrams, and an exhaustive description of continuous linear representations of persistence diagrams. We also showcase the strength of this framework to study random persistence diagrams by providing several statistical results made meaningful thanks to this new formalism.</description>

      <title>The worst approximable rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify and enumerate all rational numbers with approximation constant at least $\frac{1}{3}$ using hyperbolic geometry. Rational numbers correspond to geodesics in the modular torus with both ends in the cusp, and the approximation constant measures how far they stay out of the cusp neighborhood in between. Compared to the original approach, the geometric point of view eliminates the need to discuss the intricate symbolic dynamics of continued fraction representations, and it clarifies the distinction between the two types of worst approximable rationals: (1) There is a plane forest of Markov fractions whose denominators are Markov numbers. They correspond to simple geodesics in the modular torus with both ends in the cusp. (2) For each Markov fraction, there are two infinite sequences of companions, which correspond to non-simple geodesics with both ends in the cusp that do not intersect a pair of disjoint simple geodesics, one with both ends in the cusp and one closed.</description>

      <title>Salter's question on the image of the Burau representation of $B_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1974, Birman posed the question of under what conditions a matrix with Laurent polynomial entries is in the image of the Burau representation. In 1984, Squier observed that the matrices in the image are contained in a unitary group. In 2021, Salter formulated a specific question: whether the central quotient of the Burau image group is the central quotient of a certain subgroup of the unitary group. We solve this question negatively in the simplest nontrivial case, $n=3$, algorithmically constructing a counterexample.</description>
