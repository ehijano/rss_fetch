      <title>Hedge Error Analysis In Black Scholes Option Pricing Model: An Asymptotic Approach Towards Finite Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Black-Scholes option pricing model remains a cornerstone in financial mathematics, yet its application is often challenged by the need for accurate hedging strategies, especially in dynamic market environments. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of hedge errors within the Black-Scholes framework, focusing on the efficacy of finite difference techniques in calculating option sensitivities. Employing an asymptotic approach, we investigate the behavior of hedge errors under various market conditions, emphasizing the implications for risk management and portfolio optimization. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing hedge errors and enhancing the robustness of option pricing models. Our findings provide valuable insights into improving the accuracy of hedging strategies and advancing the understanding of option pricing in financial markets.</description>

      <title>An Asymmetric Capital Asset Pricing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing a measure of market risk is an important issue for investors and financial institutions. However, the existing models for this purpose are per definition symmetric. The current paper introduces an asymmetric capital asset pricing model for measurement of the market risk. It explicitly accounts for the fact that falling prices determine the risk for a long position in the risky asset and the rising prices govern the risk for a short position. Thus, a position dependent market risk measure that is provided accords better with reality. The empirical application reveals that Apple stock is more volatile than the market only for the short seller. Surprisingly, the investor that has a long position in this stock is facing a lower volatility than the market. This property is not captured by the standard asset pricing model, which has important implications for the expected returns and hedging designs.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Ambiguity and Potential Exponential Computational Speed-Ups to Solving Dynamic Asset Pricing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate quantum computing solutions to a large class of dynamic nonlinear asset pricing models using algorithms, in theory exponentially more efficient than classical ones, which leverage the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. The equilibrium asset pricing solution is a quantum state. We introduce quantum decision-theoretic foundations of ambiguity and model/parameter uncertainty to deal with model selection.</description>
