      <title>Spatial modeling algorithms for reactions and transport (SMART) in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological cells rely on precise spatiotemporal coordination of biochemical reactions to control their many functions. Such cell signaling networks have been a common focus for mathematical models, but they remain challenging to simulate, particularly in realistic cell geometries. Herein, we present our software, Spatial Modeling Algorithms for Reactions and Transport (SMART), a package that takes in high-level user specifications about cell signaling networks and molecular transport, and then assembles and solves the associated mathematical and computational systems. SMART uses state-of-the-art finite element analysis, via the FEniCS Project software, to efficiently and accurately resolve cell signaling events over discretized cellular and subcellular geometries. We demonstrate its application to several different biological systems, including YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction, calcium signaling in neurons and cardiomyocytes, and ATP generation in mitochondria. Throughout, we utilize experimentally-derived realistic cellular geometries represented by well-conditioned tetrahedral meshes. These scenarios demonstrate the applicability, flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of SMART across a range of temporal and spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Network reduction and absence of Hopf Bifurcations in dual phosphorylation networks with three Intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorylation networks, representing the mechanisms by which proteins are phosphorylated at one or multiple sites, are ubiquitous in cell signalling and display rich dynamics such as unlimited multistability. Dual-site phosphorylation networks are known to exhibit oscillations in the form of periodic trajectories, when phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occurs as a mixed mechanism: phosphorylation of the two sites requires one encounter of the kinase, while dephosphorylation of the two sites requires two encounters with the phosphatase. A still open question is whether a mechanism requiring two encounters for both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation also admits oscillations. In this work we provide evidence in favor of the absence of oscillations of this network by precluding Hopf bifurcations in any reduced network comprising three out of its four intermediate protein complexes. Our argument relies on a novel network reduction step that preserves the absence of Hopf bifurcations, and on a detailed analysis of the semi-algebraic conditions precluding Hopf bifurcations obtained from Hurwitz determinants of the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian of the system. We conjecture that the removal of certain reverse reactions appearing in Michaelis-Menten-type mechanisms does not have an impact on the presence or absence of Hopf bifurcations. We prove an implication of the conjecture under certain favorable scenarios and support the conjecture with additional example-based evidence.</description>

      <title>A brief tutorial on information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the 2023 Les Houches Summer School on Theoretical Biological Physics, several students asked for some background on information theory, and so we added a tutorial to the scheduled lectures. This is largely a transcript of that tutorial, lightly edited. It covers basic definitions and context rather than detailed calculations. We hope to have maintained the informality of the presentation, including exchanges with the students, while still being useful.</description>
