      <title>Weighted Estimation of the Tail Index under Right Censorship: A Unified Approach Based on Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen integral estimators to the tail index of right-censored Pareto-type data traditionally rely on the assumption that the proportion p of upper uncensored observations exceeds one-half, corresponding to weak censoring regime. However, this condition excludes many practical settings characterized by strong censorship, where p is less than or equal to one-half. To address this bothering limitation, we propose a modification that incorporates a tuning parameter. This parameter, greater than one, assigns appropriate weights to the estimators, thereby extending the applicability of the method to the entire censoring range, where p is between zero and one. Under suitable regularity conditions, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. Extensive simulation studies reveal a clear improvement over existing methods in terms of bias and mean squared error, particularly in the strong censoring situation. These results highlight the significant practical and theoretical impact of our approach, offering a more flexible and accurate framework for tail index estimation under censoring. The usefulness of the method is further illustrated through its application to two real datasets: one on insurance losses (weak censoring) and the other on AIDS cases (strong censoring).</description>

      <title>An Asymptotically Exact Multiple Testing Procedure under Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple single-step multiple testing procedure that asymptotically controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) at the desired level exactly under the equicorrelated multivariate Gaussian setup. The method is shown to be asymptotically exact using an explicit plug-in estimator for the equicorrelation, and does not require stepwise adjustments. We establish its theoretical properties, including the convergence to the desired error level, and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulation results. We also spell out related extensions to block-correlated structures and generalized FWER control.</description>

      <title>Another look at Stein's method for Studentized nonlinear statistics with an application to U-statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take another look at using Stein's method to establish uniform Berry-Esseen bounds for Studentized nonlinear statistics, highlighting variable censoring and an exponential randomized concentration inequality for a sum of censored variables as the essential tools to carry the arguments involved. As an important application, we prove a uniform Berry-Esseen bound for Studentized U-statistics in a form that exhibits the dependence on the degree of the kernel.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum Markov chains using coherent absorber post-processing and pattern counting estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two step strategy for estimating one-dimensional dynamical parameters of a quantum Markov chain, which involves quantum post-processing the output using a coherent quantum absorber and a "pattern counting'' estimator computed as a simple additive functional of the outcomes trajectory produced by sequential, identical measurements on the output units. We provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that the estimator achieves the quantum Cramer-Rao bound in the limit of large output size. Our estimation method is underpinned by an asymptotic theory of translationally invariant modes (TIMs) built as averages of shifted tensor products of output operators, labelled by binary patterns. For large times, the TIMs form a bosonic algebra and the output state approaches a joint coherent state of the TIMs whose amplitude depends linearly on the mismatch between system and absorber parameters. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime the TIMs capture the full quantum Fisher information of the output state. While directly probing the TIMs' quadratures seems impractical, we show that the standard sequential measurement is an effective joint measurement of all the TIMs number operators; indeed, we show that counts of different binary patterns extracted from the measurement trajectory have the expected joint Poisson distribution. Together with the displaced-null methodology of J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 245304 2024 this provides a computationally efficient estimator which only depends on the total number of patterns. This opens the way for similar estimation strategies in continuous-time dynamics, expanding the results of Phys. Rev. X 13, 031012 2023.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05854v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing is often criticized for its lack of practical relevance: since ``all models are wrong'', the null hypothesis that the data conform to our model is ultimately always rejected as the sample size grows. Despite this, probabilistic models are still used extensively, raising the more pertinent question of whether the model is \emph{good enough} for the task at hand. This question can be formalized as a robust goodness-of-fit testing problem by asking whether the data were generated from a distribution that is a mild perturbation of the model. In this paper, we show that existing kernel goodness-of-fit tests are not robust under common notions of robustness including both qualitative and quantitative robustness. We further show that robustification techniques using tilted kernels, while effective in the parameter estimation literature, are not sufficient to ensure both types of robustness in the testing setting. To address this, we propose the first robust kernel goodness-of-fit test, which resolves this open problem by using kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) balls. This framework encompasses many well-known perturbation models, such as Huber's contamination and density-band models.</description>

      <title>A spectral method for multi-view subspace learning using the product of projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view data provides complementary information on the same set of observations, with multi-omics and multimodal sensor data being common examples. Analyzing such data typically requires distinguishing between shared (joint) and unique (individual) signal subspaces from noisy, high-dimensional measurements. Despite many proposed methods, the conditions for reliably identifying joint and individual subspaces remain unclear. We rigorously quantify these conditions, which depend on the ratio of the signal rank to the ambient dimension, principal angles between true subspaces, and noise levels. Our approach characterizes how spectrum perturbations of the product of projection matrices, derived from each view's estimated subspaces, affect subspace separation. Using these insights, we provide an easy-to-use and scalable estimation algorithm. In particular, we employ rotational bootstrap and random matrix theory to partition the observed spectrum into joint, individual, and noise subspaces. Diagnostic plots visualize this partitioning, providing practical and interpretable insights into the estimation performance. In simulations, our method estimates joint and individual subspaces more accurately than existing approaches. Applications to multi-omics data from colorectal cancer patients and nutrigenomic study of mice demonstrate improved performance in downstream predictive tasks.</description>

      <title>A method for sparse and robust independent component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents sparse invariant coordinate selection, SICS, a new method for sparse and robust independent component analysis. SICS is based on classical invariant coordinate selection, which is presented in such a form that a LASSO-type penalty can be applied to promote sparsity. Robustness is achieved by using robust scatter matrices. In the first part of the paper, the background and building blocks: scatter matrices, measures of robustness, ICS and independent component analysis, are carefully introduced. Then the proposed new method and its algorithm are derived and presented. This part also includes a consistency result for a general case of sparse ICS-like methods. The performance of SICS in identifying sparse independent component loadings is investigated with multiple simulations. The method is illustrated with an example in constructing sparse causal graphs and we also propose a graphical tool for selecting the appropriate sparsity level in SICS.</description>

      <title>Faster Diffusion Models via Higher-Order Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K&gt;0$ is an arbitrary fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE. More broadly, our work develops a theoretical framework towards understanding the efficacy of high-order methods for accelerated sampling.</description>
