      <title>Direct Flow Simulations with Implicit Neural Representation of Complex Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful approach for encoding complex geometries as continuous functions. These implicit models are widely used in computer vision and 3D content creation, but their integration into scientific computing workflows, such as finite element or finite volume simulations, remains limited. One reason is that conventional simulation pipelines require explicit geometric inputs (meshes), forcing INR-based shapes to be converted to meshes--a step that introduces approximation errors, computational overhead, and significant manual effort. Immersed boundary methods partially alleviate this issue by allowing simulations on background grids without body-fitted meshes. However, they still require an explicit boundary description and can suffer from numerical artifacts, such as sliver cut cells. The shifted boundary method (SBM) eliminates the need for explicit geometry by using grid-aligned surrogate boundaries, making it inherently compatible with implicit shape representations. Here, we present a framework that directly couples neural implicit geometries with SBM to perform high-fidelity fluid flow simulations without any intermediate mesh generation. By leveraging neural network inference, our approach computes the surrogate boundary and distance vectors required by SBM on-the-fly directly from the INR, thus completely bypassing traditional geometry processing. We demonstrate this approach on canonical 2D and 3D flow benchmarks (lid-driven cavity flows) and complex geometries (gyroids, the Stanford bunny, and AI-generated shapes), achieving simulation accuracy comparable to conventional mesh-based methods. This work highlights a novel pathway for integrating AI-driven geometric representations into computational physics, establishing INRs as a versatile and scalable tool for simulations and removing a long-standing bottleneck in geometry handling.</description>

      <title>HessianForge: Scalable LiDAR reconstruction with Physics-Informed Neural Representation and Smoothness Energy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient 3D mapping of large-scale outdoor environments from LiDAR measurements is a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly towards ensuring smooth and artifact-free surface reconstructions. Although the state-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for high-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free manifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address this issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization problem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that penalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based approach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold from raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that optimizes the $L_2$-Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework includes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale neural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different scales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to correct topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the generated mesh. We propose a \texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares optimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce feature-preserving smoothing. We evaluate our approach on large-scale outdoor datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved accuracy and smoothness.

      <title>Computational Design and Fabrication of Protective Foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to design protective foam for packaging 3D objects. Users first load a 3D object and define a block-based design space by setting the block resolution and the size of each block. The system then constructs a block map in the space using depth textures of the input object, separates the map into two regions, and outputs the regions as foams. The proposed method is fast and stable, allowing the user to interactively make protective foams. The generated foam is a height field in each direction, so the foams can easily be fabricated using various materials, such as LEGO blocks, sponge with slits, glass, and wood. This paper shows some examples of fabrication results to demonstrate the robustness of our system. In addition, we conducted a user study and confirmed that our system is effective for manually designing protective foams envisioned by users.</description>

      <title>InteractEdit: Zero-Shot Editing of Human-Object Interactions in Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents InteractEdit, a novel framework for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) editing, addressing the challenging task of transforming an existing interaction in an image into a new, desired interaction while preserving the identities of the subject and object. Unlike simpler image editing scenarios such as attribute manipulation, object replacement or style transfer, HOI editing involves complex spatial, contextual, and relational dependencies inherent in humans-objects interactions. Existing methods often overfit to the source image structure, limiting their ability to adapt to the substantial structural modifications demanded by new interactions. To address this, InteractEdit decomposes each scene into subject, object, and background components, then employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and selective fine-tuning to preserve pretrained interaction priors while learning the visual identity of the source image. This regularization strategy effectively balances interaction edits with identity consistency. We further introduce IEBench, the most comprehensive benchmark for HOI editing, which evaluates both interaction editing and identity preservation. Our extensive experiments show that InteractEdit significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for future HOI editing research and unlocking new possibilities for creative and practical applications. Code will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Rendering for Multimodal Autonomous Driving: Merging Neural and Physics-Based Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</description>

      <title>Spiritus: An AI-Assisted Tool for Creating 2D Characters and Animations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents Spiritus, an AI-assisted creation tool designed to streamline 2D character animation creation while enhancing creative flexibility. By integrating natural language processing and diffusion models, users can efficiently transform natural language descriptions into personalized 2D characters and animations. The system employs automated segmentation, layered costume techniques, and dynamic mesh-skeleton binding solutions to support flexible adaptation of complex costumes and additional components. Spiritus further achieves real-time animation generation and efficient animation resource reuse between characters through the integration of BVH data and motion diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate Spiritus's effectiveness in reducing technical barriers, enhancing creative freedom, and supporting resource universality. Future work will focus on optimizing user experience and further exploring the system's human-computer collaboration potential.</description>

      <title>Free Your Hands: Lightweight Relightable Turntable Capture Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from multiple captured photos of an object is a widely studied problem. Achieving high quality typically requires dense sampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating and tedious manual labor. Manually positioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be difficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to replicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and defocus due to human error. In this paper, we present a lightweight object capture pipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup. We use a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera. As the turntable rotates, we automatically capture dense samples from various views and lighting conditions; we can repeat this for several camera positions. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images in several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference frame, the light conditions vary; this is harmful to a standard NVS method like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) which assumes fixed lighting. We design a neural radiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this issue and allows relightability as an additional benefit. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework, achieving competitive quality compared to previous methods with exhaustive acquisition and showcasing its potential for relighting and harmonization tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting for Few-Shot Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, 3DGS tends to overfit when trained with sparse views, limiting its generalization to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we address this overfitting issue by introducing Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS). We achieve self-ensembling by incorporating an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy during training. A $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model and a $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model are jointly trained on the available images. The $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model is dynamically perturbed based on rendering uncertainty across training steps, generating diverse perturbed models with negligible computational overhead. Discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and these perturbed models are minimized throughout training, forming a robust ensemble of 3DGS models. This ensemble, represented by the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model, is then used to generate novel-view images during inference. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances NVS quality under few-shot training conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at: https://sailor-z.github.io/projects/SEGS.html.</description>

      <title>Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided Cross-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

      <title>SVGBuilder: Component-Based Colored SVG Generation with Text-Guided Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are essential XML-based formats for versatile graphics, offering resolution independence and scalability. Unlike raster images, SVGs use geometric shapes and support interactivity, animation, and manipulation via CSS and JavaScript. Current SVG generation methods face challenges related to high computational costs and complexity. In contrast, human designers use component-based tools for efficient SVG creation. Inspired by this, SVGBuilder introduces a component-based, autoregressive model for generating high-quality colored SVGs from textual input. It significantly reduces computational overhead and improves efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our model generates SVGs up to 604 times faster than optimization-based approaches. To address the limitations of existing SVG datasets and support our research, we introduce ColorSVG-100K, the first large-scale dataset of colored SVGs, comprising 100,000 graphics. This dataset fills the gap in color information for SVG generation models and enhances diversity in model training. Evaluation against state-of-the-art models demonstrates SVGBuilder's superior performance in practical applications, highlighting its efficiency and quality in generating complex SVG graphics.</description>
