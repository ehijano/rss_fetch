      <title>Applications of Knot Theory for the Improvement of the AlphaFold Protein Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold, a groundbreaking protein prediction model, has revolutionized protein structure prediction, populating the AlphaFold Protein Database (AFDB) with millions of predicted structures. However, AlphaFold's accuracy in predicting proteins with intricate topologies, such as knots, remains a concern. This study investigates AlphaFold's performance in predicting knotted proteins and explores potential solutions to enhance the AFDB's reliability. Forty-five experimentally verified knotted protein structures from the KnotProt database were compared to their AlphaFold-generated counterparts. Knot analysis was performed using PyKnot, a PyMOL plugin, employing both Gauss codes and Alexander-Briggs knot notations. Results showed 95.6% accuracy in predicting the general shape of knots using Alexander-Briggs notation. However, Gauss code analysis revealed a 55.6% discrepancy, indicating AlphaFold's limitations in accurately representing the intricate orientation and directionality of knots. This Applications of Knot Theory for the improvement of the AlphaFold Protein Database suggests potential inaccuracies in a significant portion of the AFDB's knotted protein structures. The study underscores the need for improved knot representation in AlphaFold and proposes potential solutions, including transitioning to a single-module design or removing incorrectly predicted structures from the AFDB. These findings highlight the importance of continuous refinement for AI-based protein structure prediction tools to ensure the accuracy and reliability of protein databases for research and drug development.</description>

      <title>Category-Specific Topological Learning of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials with high surface area, adjustable porosity, and structural tunability, making them ideal for diverse applications. However, traditional experimental and computational methods have limited scalability and interpretability, hindering effective exploration of MOF structure-property relationships. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a category-specific topological learning (CSTL), which combines algebraic topology with chemical insights for robust property prediction. The model represents MOF structures as simplicial complexes and incorporates elemental categorizations to enable balanced, interpretable machine learning study. By integrating category-specific persistent homology, CSTL captures both global and local structural characteristics, rendering multi-dimensional, category-specific descriptors that support a predictive model with high accuracy and robustness across eight MOF datasets, outperforming all previous results. This alignment of topological and chemical features enhances the predictive power and interpretability of CSTL, advancing understanding of structure-property relationships of MOFs and promoting efficient material discovery.</description>

      <title>Generating Minimum Free Energy Paths With Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method combining denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) with the string method is presented to generate minimum free energy paths between metastable states in molecular systems. It has been demonstrated in recent work that DDPMs at low noise levels can approximate the gradient of the potential of mean force, allowing efficient sampling of high-dimensional configurational spaces. Building on this insight, it is shown here that DDPM-derived force fields accurately generate transition pathways for the analytical Muller-Brown potential and for the alanine dipeptide system at some range of noise levels for DDPMs, recovering the transition path and implicitly capturing solvent effects in the case of alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <title>NeuralPLexer3: Physio-Realistic Biomolecular Complex Structure Prediction with Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure determination is essential to a mechanistic understanding of diseases and the development of novel therapeutics. Machine-learning-based structure prediction methods have made significant advancements by computationally predicting protein and bioassembly structures from sequences and molecular topology alone. Despite substantial progress in the field, challenges remain to deliver structure prediction models to real-world drug discovery. Here, we present NeuralPLexer3 -- a physics-inspired flow-based generative model that achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on key biomolecular interaction types and improves training and sampling efficiency compared to its predecessors and alternative methodologies. Examined through newly developed benchmarking strategies, NeuralPLexer3 excels in vital areas that are crucial to structure-based drug design, such as physical validity and ligand-induced conformational changes.</description>

      <title>FlowDock: Geometric Flow Matching for Generative Protein-Ligand Docking and Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powerful generative models of protein-ligand structure have recently been proposed, but few of these methods support both flexible protein-ligand docking and affinity estimation. Of those that do, none can directly model multiple binding ligands concurrently or have been rigorously benchmarked on pharmacologically relevant drug targets, hindering their widespread adoption in drug discovery efforts. In this work, we propose FlowDock, a deep geometric generative model based on conditional flow matching that learns to directly map unbound (apo) structures to their bound (holo) counterparts for an arbitrary number of binding ligands. Furthermore, FlowDock provides predicted structural confidence scores and binding affinity values with each of its generated protein-ligand complex structures, enabling fast virtual screening of new (multi-ligand) drug targets. For the commonly-used PoseBusters Benchmark dataset, FlowDock achieves a 51% blind docking success rate using unbound (apo) protein input structures and without any information derived from multiple sequence alignments, and for the challenging new DockGen-E dataset, FlowDock matches the performance of single-sequence Chai-1 for binding pocket generalization. Additionally, in the ligand category of the 16th community-wide Critical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP16), FlowDock ranked among the top-5 methods for pharmacological binding affinity estimation across 140 protein-ligand complexes, demonstrating the efficacy of its learned representations in virtual screening. Source code, data, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/FlowDock.</description>

      <title>EquiFlow: Equivariant Conditional Flow Matching with Optimal Transport for 3D Molecular Conformation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular 3D conformations play a key role in determining how molecules interact with other molecules or protein surfaces. Recent deep learning advancements have improved conformation prediction, but slow training speeds and difficulties in utilizing high-degree features limit performance. We propose EquiFlow, an equivariant conditional flow matching model with optimal transport. EquiFlow uniquely applies conditional flow matching in molecular 3D conformation prediction, leveraging simulation-free training to address slow training speeds. It uses a modified Equiformer model to encode Cartesian molecular conformations along with their atomic and bond properties into higher-degree embeddings. Additionally, EquiFlow employs an ODE solver, providing faster inference speeds compared to diffusion models with SDEs. Experiments on the QM9 dataset show that EquiFlow predicts small molecule conformations more accurately than current state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Biomolecular Conformational Ensembles with PENSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions -- for example, with various mutations or bound ligands -- in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, e.g., tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is one of the most relevant characteristics of systems of interest in nature and technology, ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle number through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we review complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying number of particles inspired by rather different specific numerical goals. As a result of the analysis on the underlying common structure of these models, we propose a unifying master equation for general dynamical systems with varying number of particles. This equation embeds all the previous models and can potentially model a much larger range of complex systems, ranging from molecular to social agent-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>New Aspects of Analyzing Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a summary of mathematical tools we used in research of analyzing the structure of proteins with amyloid form \cite{xi2024Top}. We defined several geometry indicators on the discrete curve namely the hop distance, the discrete curvature and the discrete torsion. Then, we used these indicators to analyze the structure of amyloid fibrils by regarding its peptide chains as discrete curves in $\Rds^3$. We gave examples to show that these indicators give novel insights in the characterization analysis of the structure of amyloid fibrils, for example the discrete torsion can detect the hydrogen bonds interactions between layers of amyloid fibril. {Moreover,} the topological tool performs better than the root mean square deviation (RMSD) in quantifying the difference of the structure of amyloid fibrils, etc.</description>
