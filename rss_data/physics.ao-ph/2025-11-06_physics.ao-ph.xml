      <title>Impact of Wave Interference on the Consistency Relations of Internal Gravity Waves near the Ocean Bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency relations of internal gravity waves (IGWs) describe ratios of cross-spectral quantities as functions of frequency. It has been a common practice to evaluate the measured or simulated signals (e.g., time series of velocity, density, etc.) against the consistency relations, as a way to determine whether an oceanic field of interest is comprised of IGWs. One such study is carried out in Nelson et al. (JGR Oceans, 125(5), 2020, e2019JC015974), which certifies that the ocean interior field in a numerical simulation of a region southwest of Hawaii is dominated by IGWs, through evaluating the consistency relations derived from time series at a depth of 620 m. However, we find that when the same procedure is applied at greater depths (e.g., 2362 m, 3062 m, and 4987 m), a clear deviation of the simulated signal from the classical consistency relations is observed. In this paper, we identify the reason for the unexpected deviation and show that it is a general phenomenon due to interference of low vertical modes under the reflection by the ocean bottom. We further derive a new set of formulae to characterize the consistency relations of these low modes and validate these formulae using model output.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic U-Net Approach to Downscaling Climate Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate models are limited by heavy computational costs, often producing outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, while many climate change impact studies require finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this gap, and we adapt the probabilistic U-Net for this task, combining a deterministic U-Net backbone with a variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. We evaluate four training objectives, afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for downscaling precipitation and temperature from $16\times$ coarser resolution. Our main finding is that WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain settings, whereas afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Probabilistic Air-Sea Flux Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying air-sea fluxes is important for understanding air-sea interactions and improving coupled weather and climate systems. This study introduces a probabilistic framework to represent the highly variable nature of air-sea fluxes, which is missing in deterministic bulk algorithms. Assuming Gaussian distributions conditioned on the input variables, we use artificial neural networks and eddy-covariance measurement data to estimate the mean and variance by minimizing negative log-likelihood loss. The trained neural networks provide alternative mean flux estimates to existing bulk algorithms, and quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates. Stochastic parameterization of air-sea turbulent fluxes can be constructed by sampling from the predicted distributions. Tests in a single-column forced upper-ocean model suggest that changes in flux algorithms influence sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth seasonally. The ensemble spread in stochastic runs is most pronounced during spring restratification.</description>

      <title>Impact of Heterogeneity on Scalar Flux Variance Relations Across Diverse Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), the traditional surface layer theory used to understand the behavior, scaling and exchange of heat, water vapor and carbon dioxide between the land surface and atmosphere relies on a number of commonly broken assumptions. In particular, traditional theory breaks down under three different forms of heterogeneity highlighted in this work: spatial heterogeneity in the sources of the scalars, heterogeneity in the Reynolds stress tensor (turbulence anisotropy), and temporal heterogeneity (non-stationarity). The work explores the relationship between the idealized flux-variance relations and these three forms of heterogeneity across a diverse network of 47 flux towers representing a broad range of ecosystems including forests, agricultural land, grasslands, tundra, tropical and arid: the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON). Results use high resolution spatial data (1 meter resolution) to show a direct relationship between spatial heterogeneity and deviation from traditional scaling relations. The study indicates an interplay between stationarity and anisotropy, with the non-dimensionalized scalar variance scaling more strongly with anisotropy under more non-stationary turbulence conditions. Updated flux-variance relations that leverage turbulence anisotropy for the scaling of heat are introduced, as are novel anisotropy-generalized scalings for water vapor and carbon dioxide. The work also explores in detail how the scaling relations, and their relationship with heterogeneity, vary across the diverse sites in the NEON network. Deviations from traditional theory in carbon dioxide scaling in particular are well correlated with the bioactivity of the site. Results have important implications for development of improved surface layer parameterizations in large scale atmospheric models and flux-variance based flux measurements.</description>
