      <title>Diffusive spreading of a polydisperse polymer solution in a channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long DNA molecules can be mapped by cutting them with restriction enzymes inside a narrow channel. Once cut, the individual fragments thus produced move away from each other due to diffusion and entropic effects. We investigate how long it takes for these fragments to travel distances large enough for an experimental device to distinguish them and (possibly) estimate their size. In essence, this is a single-file diffusion process in which molecules of different sizes and hence different diffusion coefficients spread out from an initially dense configuration. We use Monte Carlo methods to investigate this class of problems and define the time taken to reach the required final state as a first-passage \textit{spreading time}. Our results demonstrate that the stochastic nature of the diffusion process is as significant as the specifics of the molecular size distribution in determining the spreading time. We examine the relationship between the spreading time and the final space occupied by the fragments as a function of the experimental parameters and determine the fundamental length scale governing this process. We introduce a molecular sequence randomness parameter, $Z$, which is linearly correlated with the final spreading time. Finally, we show that the distribution function of spreading times follows a well-known form for first-passage time problems, and that its variance decreases linearly with the number of fragments.</description>

      <title>Micro-Macro Modeling of Polymeric Fluids with Multi-Bead Polymer Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the classical dumbbell (two-bead) model of polymer chains to a more detailed multi-bead representation, where each polymer chain consists of $N$ beads connected by $N-1$ springs. We develop a thermodynamically consistent micro-macro model based on the energy variational method to describe the coupled dynamics of polymer configurations and fluid flow. The resulting framework captures complex microscopic behaviors, such as bond stretching and alignment under flow, and links them to macroscopic stress responses.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy landscape of the Thomson problem: local minima and stationary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive numerical investigation of the energy landscape of the Thomson problem for systems up to $N=150$. Our results show the number of distinct configurations grows exponentially with $N$, but significantly faster than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that the average energy gap between independent configurations at a given $N$ decays exponentially with $N$, dramatically increasing the computational complexity for larger systems. Finally, we developed a novel approach that reformulates the search for stationary points in the Thomson problem (or similar systems) as an equivalent minimization problem using a specifically designed potential. Leveraging this method, we performed a detailed exploration of the solution landscape for $N\leq24$ and estimated the growth of the number of stationary states to be exponential in $N$.</description>

      <title>Bridging Electrostatic Screening and Ion Transport in Lithium Salt-Doped Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li$^+$). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr$_{14}$][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x$_{LiTFSI}$ $\le$ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI doped [pyr$_{14}$][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x$_{LiTFSI}$-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.</description>

      <title>Aging of amorphous materials under cyclic strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous materials driven away from equilibrium display a diverse repertoire of complex, history-dependent behaviors. One striking feature is a failure to return to equilibrium after an abrupt change in otherwise static external conditions. Instead, amorphous materials often exhibit physical aging: an ever-slowing, nonexponential relaxation that can span a huge range of timescales. Here we examine the aging behavior of three different amorphous materials subjected to slow periodic driving. The results reveal a generic aging phenomenon characterized by a logarithmic decay of dissipation per cycle. This observation is evaluated against several mesoscopic models of amorphous matter that successfully capture aging under static conditions: (i) a collection of noninteracting relaxation processes (ii) a noisy hysteron model with random pairwise interactions, and (iii) a structural model consisting of a random network of bi-stable elastic bonds. We find that only the latter model reproduces all experimental findings and relate its success to its persistent, slow exploration of a complex energy landscape with clear signatures of replica symmetry breaking. Thus, cyclic driving emerges as a simple yet powerful protocol to characterize amorphous materials, probe their complex energy landscapes, and distinguish between different models.</description>

      <title>Packing3D: An Open-Source Analytical Framework for Computing Packing Density and Mixing Indices Using Partial Spherical Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurement of packing density. We introduce Packing3D.jl, an open-source Julia package providing analytic, partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. Our goals were to (1) eliminate boundary-artifact jumps, (2) maintain high throughput on large datasets, and (3) deliver standard mixing metrics via a unified API. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. A short-circuit bounding-sphere test shortens computations: fully inside or outside spheres are handled in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, and only near-boundary spheres invoke the analytic kernels. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. Packing3D.jl converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and processes up to $10^8$ sphere-cell intersections per second in single-threaded Julia with linear scaling in particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). Packing3D.jl provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimization in granular process engineering.

      <title>Strain dependent viscous response describes the mechanics of cohesionless soft granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and are used extensively in daily life and in industry. The modeling of these materials remains challenging; therefore, finding models with acceptable predictive accuracy that at the same time also reflect the complexity of the granular dynamics is a central research theme in the field. Soft particle packings present additional modeling challenges, as it has become clear that soft particles also have particle-level relaxation timescales that affect the packing behavior. We construct a simple one-dimensional, one-timescale model that replicates much of the essence of compressed hydrogel packing mechanics. We verify the model performance against both 3D and 2D packings of hydrogel particles, under both controlled strain and stress deformation conditions. We find that the modification of a Standard Linear Solid model with a strain dependent prefactor for the relaxation captures the time-history and rate dependence, as well as the necessary absence of cohesion effectively. We also indicate some directions of future improvement of the modeling.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of microphase separation in a swollen, strain-stiffening polymer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic MicroPhase Separation (EMPS) provides a simple route to create soft materials with homogeneous microstructures by leveraging the supersaturation of crosslinked polymer networks with liquids. At low supersaturation, network elasticity stabilizes a uniform mixture, but beyond a critical threshold, metastable microphase-separated domains emerge. While previous theories have focused on describing qualitative features about the size and morphology of these domains, they do not make quantitative predictions about EMPS phase diagrams. In this work, we extend Flory-Huggins theory to quantitatively capture EMPS phase diagrams by incorporating strain-stiffening effects. This model requires no fitting parameters and relies solely on independently measured solubility parameters and large-deformation mechanical responses. Our results reveal that strain-stiffening enables metastable microphase separation within the swelling equilibrium state and why the microstructures can range from discrete droplets to bicontinuous networks. This works highlights the critical role of nonlinear elasticity in controlling phase-separated morphologies in polymer gels.</description>

      <title>A pipeline for Megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy on soft matter samples at the MID instrument of European XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the experimental protocol and data processing framework for Megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) experiments on soft matter samples, implemented at the Materials Imaging and Dynamics (MID) instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL). Due to the introduction of a standard configuration and the implementation of a highly automated data processing pipeline, MHz-XPCS measurements can now be conducted and analyzed with minimal user intervention. A key challenge lies in managing the extremely large data volumes generated by the Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) - often reaching several petabytes within a single experiment. We describe the technical implementation, discuss the hardware requirements related to effective parallel data processing, and propose strategies to enhance data quality, in particular related to data reduction strategies and an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we address strategies for making the processed data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), in alignment with the goals of the DAPHNE4NFDI project.</description>

      <title>Breaking Mechanical Holography in Combinatorial Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response strongly depends on the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. We study a family of possible block types for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Blocks that are centrally symmetric induce holographic order, such that mechanical compatibility (meaning that blocks do not impede each other's motion) implies bulk-boundary coupling. With them, one can design a compatible metamaterial that will deform in any desired texture only on part of its boundary. With blocks that break holographic order, we demonstrate how to design the deformation texture on the entire boundary. Correspondingly, the number of compatible holographic metamaterials scales exponentially with the boundary, while in non-holographic cases we show that it scales exponentially with the bulk.</description>

      <title>Defect Positioning in Combinatorial Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response depends on the frustration (or its absence) due to the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. Specifically, any minimal loop of blocks that may not simultaneously deform in their softest mode defines a mechanical defect at the vertex (in two dimensions) or edge (in three dimensions) that the loop encircles. Defects stiffen the metamaterial, and allow to design the spatial patterns of stress and deformation as the system is externally loaded. We study the ability to place defects at arbitrary positions in metamaterials made of a family of block types that we recently introduced for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Alongside blocks for which we show that any defect configuration is possible, we identify situations in which not all sets are realizable as defects. One of the restrictions is that in three dimensions, defected edges form closed curves. Even in cases when not all geometries of defect lines are possible, we show how to produce defect lines of arbitrary knottedness.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a mixture of proliferating and motile active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proliferation and motility are ubiquitous drivers of activity in biological systems. Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.</description>
