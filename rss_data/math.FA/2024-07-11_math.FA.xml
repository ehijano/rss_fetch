      <title>Trichotomy for the orbits of a hypercyclic operator on a Banach space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a trichotomy for the orbits of a hypercyclic operator $T$ on a separable Banach space $X$: (1) every vector is mean asymptotic to zero; (2) generic vectors are absolutely mean irregular; (3) every hypercyclic vector is mean divergent to infinity. Examples of weighted backward shifts on $\ell^p$ show that all three cases can happen.</description>

      <title>Differential complexes for local Dirichlet spaces, and non-local-to-local approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differential $p$-forms on non-smooth and possibly fractal metric measure spaces, endowed with a local Dirichlet form. Using this local Dirichlet form, we prove a result on the localization of antisymmetric functions of $p+1$ variables on diagonal neighborhoods to differential $p$-forms. This result generalizes both the well-known classical localization on smooth Riemannian manifolds and the well-known semigroup approximation for quadratic forms. We observe that a related localization map taking functions into forms is well-defined and induces a chain map from a differential complex of Kolmogorov-Alexander-Spanier type onto a differential complex of deRham type.</description>

      <title>Near-order relation of power means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the setting of positive definite operators we study the near-order properties of power means such as the quasi-arithmetic mean (H\"{o}lder mean) and R\'{e}nyi power mean. We see the monotonicity of spectral geometric mean and Wasserstein mean on parameters with respect to the near-order and the near-order relationship between the spectral geometric mean and Wasserstein mean. Furthermore, the monotonicity of quasi-arithmetic mean on parameters and the convergence of R\'{e}nyi power mean to the log-Euclidean mean with respect to the near-order have been established.</description>

      <title>On uniform Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as type approximations of linear operators and preservation of geometric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniform $\epsilon-$BPB approximations of bounded linear operators between Banach spaces from a geometric perspective. We show that for sufficiently small positive values of $\epsilon,$ many geometric properties like smoothness, norm attainment and extremality of operators are preserved under such approximations. We present examples of pairs of Banach spaces satisfying non-trivial norm preserving uniform $\epsilon-$BPB approximation property in the global sense. We also study these concepts in case of bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces. Our approach in the present article leads to the improvement and generalization of some earlier results in this context.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Krein`s extension formalism for symmetric relations with deficiency index (1,1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let S be a symmetric relation with deficiency index (1,1). In this article, we extend Krein`s resolvent formalism in order to describe all, not necessarily self-adjoint, extensions $S \subset \tilde{A}$ with $\varrho(\tilde{A})\neq \emptyset$. The corresponding $Q$-functions turn out to be quasi-Herglotz functions. We will use their structure to characterize the spectrum of such extensions. Finally, we also provide a model for such an extension on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space when $S$ is simple.</description>

      <title>Perimetric contraction on quadrilaterals and related fixed point results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a four-point analogue of Banach-type, Kannan-type, and Chatterjea-type contractions, and examine their properties. We establish sufficient conditions under which these mappings achieve fixed points in a complete metric space. Notably, the classical Banach contraction principle emerges as a special case of our results. To illustrate our theoretical findings, we present several non-trivial examples.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Topological Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of (abelian) similarity scheme, as a constructive model for topological self-similar fractals, in the same way in which the notion of iterated function system furnishes a constructive notion of self-similar fractals in a metric environment. At the same time, our notion gives a constructive approach to the Kigami-Kameyama notion of topological fractals, since a similarity scheme produces a topological fractal a la Kigami-Kameyama, and many Kigami-Kameyama topological fractals may be constructed via similarity schemes. Our scheme consists of objects $X_0\stackrel{\varphi}{\rightarrow}X_1\stackrel{\pi}{\leftarrow} Y\times X_0$, where $X_0,X_1$ and $Y$ are compact Hausdorff spaces, the map $\varphi$ is continuous injective and the map $\pi$ is continuous surjective. This scheme produces a sequence $X_n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, of compact Hausdorff spaces, $X_n$ embedded in $X_{n+1}$, and a compact Hausdorff space $X_\infty$ giving a sort of injective limit space, which turns out to be self-similar. We observe that the space $Y$ parametrizes the generalized similarity maps, and finiteness of $Y$ is not required.</description>

      <title>Optimal function spaces in weighted Sobolev embeddings with $\alpha$-homogeneous weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study weighted Sobolev inequalities on open convex cones endowed with $\alpha$-homogeneous weights satisfying a certain concavity condition. We establish a so-called reduction principle for these inequalities and characterize optimal rearrangement-invariant function spaces for these weighted Sobolev inequalities. Both optimal target and optimal domain spaces are characterized. Abstract results are accompanied by general yet concrete examples of optimal function spaces. For these examples, the class of so-called Lorentz--Karamata spaces, which contains in particular Lebesgue spaces, Lorentz spaces, and some Orlicz spaces, is used.</description>

      <title>Stability and invariant norms of arbitrary sets of 2x2 matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invariant norms, also called Barabanov norms, are defined in $R^d$ for any compact family $\mathcal A$ of $d \times d$ matrices. They correspond to the linear switching system, which is a differential equation $\dot x(t) = A(t)x(t)$, where $A(t) \in \mathcal A$ for each $t$. The invariant norm identifies the trajectories $x(t)$ of the fastest asymptotic growth as $t\to +\infty$. It also solves the stability problem. This norm is difficult to construct even for a pair of matrices. We show that in case $d=2$ the invariant norm can be found explicitly for every compact matrix family $\mathcal A$. If $\mathcal A$ does not contain a dominant matrix with a real spectrum, then this norm is always unique (up to a multiplier) and is $C^1$, otherwise, there may be infinitely many norms. All of them can be found and classified.</description>

      <title>Ultra Feller operators from a functional analytic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a widely acknowledged fact that the product of two positive strong Feller operators on a Polish space $E$ enjoys the ultra Feller property. We present a functional analytic proof of this fact that allows us to drop the assumption that the operators are positive and also extends the applicability of this result to more general state spaces. As it turns out, this result can be considered a variant of the theorem that on a Banach space with the Dunford--Pettis property, the product of two weakly compact operators is compact.</description>

      <title>Learning linear operators: Infinite-dimensional regression as a well-behaved non-compact inverse problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a linear operator $\theta$ between two Hilbert spaces from empirical observations, which we interpret as least squares regression in infinite dimensions. We show that this goal can be reformulated as an inverse problem for $\theta$ with the feature that its forward operator is generally non-compact (even if $\theta$ is assumed to be compact or of $p$-Schatten class). However, we prove that, in terms of spectral properties and regularisation theory, this inverse problem is equivalent to the known compact inverse problem associated with scalar response regression.
  Our framework allows for the elegant derivation of dimension-free rates for generic learning algorithms under H\"older-type source conditions. The proofs rely on the combination of techniques from kernel regression with recent results on concentration of measure for sub-exponential Hilbertian random variables. The obtained rates hold for a variety of practically-relevant scenarios in functional regression as well as nonlinear regression with operator-valued kernels and match those of classical kernel regression with scalar response.</description>

      <title>Formal manifolds: foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series that studies smooth relative Lie algebra homologies and cohomologies based on the theory of formal manifolds and formal Lie groups. In this paper, we lay the foundations for this study by introducing the notion of formal manifolds in the context of differential geometry, inspired by the notion of formal schemes in algebraic geometry. We develop the basic theory for formal manifolds, and establish a fully faithful contravariant functor from the category of formal manifolds to the category of topological $\mathbb{C}$-algebras. We also prove the existence of finite products in the category of formal manifolds by studying vector-valued formal functions.</description>
