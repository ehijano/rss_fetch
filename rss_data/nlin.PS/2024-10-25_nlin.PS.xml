      <title>Elastic and Inelastic Scattering of Flat-Top Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between two flat-top solitons within the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation framework. Our study results point towards a significant departure of flat-top solitons collisional characteristics from the conventional behaviors exhibited in the scattering dynamics of two bright solitons. Our investigation outlines specific regimes corresponding to the dual flat-top solitons' elastic and inelastic collisions. We determine regimes in the parameter space where exchange in the widths of the interacting flat-top solitons is possible, even within the elastic collision domain. We find a periodic occurrence of completely elastic scattering of flat-top solitons in terms of the solitons' parameters. Investigating the internal energy transfers between the solitons and the emitted radiation reveals the origin of inelasticity in flat-top solitons collisions. We perform a variational calculation that accounts for the amount of radiation produced by the collision and hence provides further insight on the physics underlying the loss of elasticity of collisions.</description>

      <title>Fractional Solitons: A Homotopic Continuation from the Biharmonic to the Harmonic $\phi^4$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the path from a harmonic to a biharmonic PDE of Klein-Gordon type from a continuation/bifurcation perspective. More specifically, we make use of the Riesz fractional derivative as a tool that allows us to interpolate between these two limits. We illustrate, in particular, how the coherent kink structures existing in these models transition from the exponential tail of the harmonic operator case, via the power-law tails of intermediate fractional orders, to the oscillatory exponential tails of the biharmonic model. Importantly, we do not limit our considerations to the single kink case, but extend to the kink-antikink pair, finding an intriguing cascade of saddle-center bifurcations happening exponentially close to the biharmonic limit. Our analysis clearly explains the transition between the infinitely many stationary soliton pairs of the biharmonic case and the absence of even a single such pair in the harmonic limit. The stability of the different configurations obtained and the associated dynamics and phase portraits are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Heat spots as structural elements of synoptic turbulence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale dynamics of heat spots in a thin layer of incompressible rotating fluid under the action of Coriolis and gravity is considered to obtain a simple model of synoptic turbulence. The derivation of equations describing the evolution of the spots is based on the use of the variational principle, perturbation theory, and the assumption of geostrophic balance. Exact solutions with piecewise constant contour curvature are found. The simplest of them look like circular spots that move with constant velocity depending on their radius. More complex solutions, such as ``loop solitons'', are shown to have fractal structure and are constructed by the gluing method. Heat spots can act as structural elements of turbulence. In particular, we show that the spectral energy density for the velocity field of a random ensemble of heat spots has the power asymptotics $E\propto k^{\alpha}$ with exponents $\alpha=2$ at $k\bar{R}&lt;1$, and $\alpha=-1$ at $k\bar{R}&gt;1$, where $\bar{R}$ is the average (over ensemble) radius of spot.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-regulated composition evolution kinetics of bicomponent nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple model and computation of Moir\'e-regulated composition evolution kinetics of bicomponent nanoclusters is presented. Assuming continuous adsorbate coverage on top of 2D bilayer and Moir\'e potential-driven nanocluster formation at fcc sites of Moir\'e landscape, these sites experience the influx of one component of a bicomponent adsorbate and the outflux of another component. Kinetics of this process is characterized for several combinations of adsorption potentials and their relative strengths.</description>
