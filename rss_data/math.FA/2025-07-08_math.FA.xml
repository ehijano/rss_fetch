      <title>Local Dispersive and Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation associated to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the linear and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations associated with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) operator endowed with the Gaussian measure. While classical Strichartz estimates are well-developed for the free Schr\"odinger operator on Euclidean spaces, extending them to non-translation-invariant operators like the OU operator presents significant challenges due to the lack of global dispersive decay. In this work, we overcome these difficulties by deriving localized $L^1 \to L^\infty$ dispersive estimates for the OU Schr\"odinger propagator using Mehler kernel techniques. We then establish a family of weighted Strichartz estimates in Gaussian $L^p$ spaces via interpolation and the abstract $TT^*$-method. As an application, we prove local well-posedness results for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power-type nonlinearity in both subcritical and critical regimes. Our framework reveals new dispersive phenomena in the context of the OU semigroup and provides the first comprehensive Strichartz theory in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a structural classification of multipliers between generalized Toeplitz kernels, extending work of Fricain and Rishika. Our results establish new equivalences between multiplier algebras and Carleson-type embeddings, linking them to Beurling Malliavin densities, P\'olya sequences, and the spectral theory of entire functions.</description>

      <title>On the connections between $F$-contractions and Meir-Keeler contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we resolve an open problem concerning the connection between $F$-contractions (Wardowski contractions) and Meir-Keeler contractions. We prove that for a nondecreasing function $F$ that has a point of discontinuity on the right, there exists an $F-$contraction that is not a Meir-Keeler contraction. Moreover, we give a condition on nonlinear $(\varphi,F)$-contractions to be Meir-Keeler contractions. In the final part of the paper, we give a class of $(E,F)-$contractions (in the sense of the paper arXiv:2009.13157 [math.FA] 28 Sep 2020) that are Meir-Keeler contractions.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of a semigroup and its relation with the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semigroup of weighted composition operators $(W_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, defined by $$W_nf(z)=(1+z+\cdots +z^n)f(z^n),$$ acts on the classical Hardy-Hilbert space $H^{2}(\mathbb{D})$, and exhibits intriguing connections with both the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) and the Invariant Subspace Problem (ISP). In this paper, we prove that the adjoint operators $W^{\ast}_{n}$, for $n\geq 2$, are Devaney chaotic, frequently hypercyclic and mixing. In particular, these operators are hypercyclic and discuss connections with the RH and invariant subspaces.</description>

      <title>$k$-Quasi $n$-Power Posinormal Operators: Theory and Weighted Conditional Type Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and investigates the class of \textit{$k$-quasi $n$-power posinormal operators} in Hilbert spaces, generalizing both posinormal and $n$-power posinormal operators. We establish fundamental properties including matrix representations in $2 \times 2$ block form, tensor product preservation ($T\otimes S$ remains in the class when $T,S$ are), and complete characterizations for weighted conditional type operators $\tTwu := wE(uf)$ on $L^2(\Sigma)$. Key theoretical contributions include a structural decomposition theorem for operators with non-dense range, spectral properties, invariant subspace behavior, and interactions with isometric operators. For weighted operators, we derive explicit conditions for $k$-quasi $n$-power posinormality in terms of weight functions $w,u$ and their conditional expectations. The work bridges abstract operator theory with concrete applications, particularly in conditional expectation analysis, while significantly extending posinormal operator theory. The results provide new tools for operator analysis with potential applications in spectral theory, functional calculus, and mathematical physics. Concrete examples throughout the paper illustrate the theory, and the framework opens new research directions in operator theory and its applications, offering both theoretical insights and practical computational tools for analyzing this important class of operators in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform: structure, convolution theorem and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03911v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform (WQPFT) combines the localization capabilities of windowed transforms with the phase modulation structure of the quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT). This paper investigates fundamental properties of the WQPFT, including linearity, shifting, modulation, conjugation, and symmetry. In addition, we derive the reproducing kernel, establish a reconstruction formula, and characterize the range of the transform. Convolution theorems in both the spectral and spatial domains are developed, along with the existence results and norm estimates for the convolution operation associated with the WQPFT. Finally, as an application, the solution of a convolution equation is given using the convolution theorem of the WQPFT.</description>

      <title>Composition ideals of Lip-Linear operators and a Hilbert space characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate classes of Lip-linear operators constructed using the composition ideal method. We focus on two fundamental linear operator ideals, $p$-summing and strongly $p$-summing operators, and extend them to define the corresponding classes of Lip-linear operators. Several key results are established, including a characterization theorem for Hilbert spaces originally due to Kwapie\'{n}. Specifically, we show that a Banach space $F$ is isomorphic to a Hilbert space if and only if every factorable strongly $p$-summing Lip-linear operator with values in $F$ is Cohen strongly $p$-summing.</description>

      <title>Kernels of trace operators via fine continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study traces of elements of fractional Sobolev spaces $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ on closed subsets $\Gamma$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, given as the supports of suitable measures $\mu$. We prove that if these measures satisfy localized upper density conditions, then quasi continuous representatives vanish quasi everywhere on $\Gamma$ if and only if they vanish $\mu$-almost everywhere on $\Gamma$. We use this result to characterize the kernel of the trace operator mapping from $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into the space of $\mu$-equivalence classes of functions on $\Gamma$ as the closure of $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \Gamma)$ in $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$. The measures do not have to satisfy a doubling condition. In particular, the set $\Gamma$ may be a finite union of closed sets having different Hausdorff dimensions. We provide corresponding results for fractional Sobolev spaces $H_p^\alpha(\Omega)$ on domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying the measure density condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $\mathcal{Z}$ is the space of all tuples of operators on a finite-dimensional Banach space endowed with the joint numerical radius norm. We obtain the structure of the extreme points of the dual unit ball of $\mathcal{Z}.$ Using this, we derive an expression for the subdifferential set of the joint numerical radius of a tuple in $\mathcal{Z}.$ Applying this expression, we characterize smooth tuples and Birkhoff-James orthogonality in $\mathcal{Z}.$ Finally, we obtain the Gateaux derivative of the joint numerical radius of a tuple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following approximation problem of a continuous function of three variables by the sum of three continuous functions of one variable:
  \[ E(f,\Omega)=\inf||f(x,y,z)-\phi(x)-\psi(y)-\omega(z)||_{\infty}=? \]
  where $f(x,y,z)$ is a given continuous function defined on $\Omega=[0,1]^3$ and the infimum runs over all triplets of continuous functions $\phi(x),\psi(y),\omega(z)$ defined on the unit interval $[0,1]$. In this paper, we will prove a formula to calculate the error $E(f,\Omega)$ under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Extension Operators for Fractional Sobolev Spaces on Lipschitz Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result is that any Lipschitz domain is an extension domain for $W^{s,p}$. This paper extends this result to Lipschitz subsets of compact Lipschitz submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We adapt the construction of an extension operator for Lipschitz domains in arXiv:1104.4345v3 to manifolds via local coordinate charts. Furthermore, the dependence on the size of the extension domain is explicit in all estimates. This result is motivated by applications in numerical analysis, most notably geometry simplification, where the explicit dependence of the continuity constant on the domain size is essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in Dynamical Sampling has been centered on characterizing frames obtained by the orbit of a vector under a bounded operator. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of bounded commuting operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space to generate a frame by unilateral iterations on a single vector. Applying the theory on submodules of the Hardy module $H^2(\mathbb{T}^2)$, we characterize these frames in terms of their relation to the two-variable Jordan block on a certain quotient module and provide some properties of frames of this form.</description>

      <title>Tighter Inequalities for $A$-Numerical Radii of Operator Matrices and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes new upper bounds for the $A$-numerical radius of operator matrices in semi-Hilbertian spaces by leveraging the $A$-Buzano inequality and developing refined techniques for operator matrices. We present several sharp inequalities that generalize and improve existing results, including novel bounds for $2 \times 2$ operator matrices involving $A$-absolute value operators and mixed Schwarz-type inequalities, refined power inequalities relating $A$-numerical radius to operator norms with optimal parameter selection, and a unified framework extending classical numerical radius inequalities to semi-Hilbertian spaces. The results are supported by detailed examples demonstrating their sharpness, including cases of equality, and we investigate their relationship to classical numerical radius inequalities, showing how our framework provides tighter estimates through $A$-operator seminorms and $A$-adjoint techniques. These theoretical advances have applications in quantum mechanics (operator bounds for quantum channels), partial differential equations (stability analysis of discretized operators), and control theory (hybrid system energy management). Our work contributes to operator theory in semi-Hilbertian spaces by providing new tools for analyzing operator matrices through $A$-numerical radius inequalities, with particular emphasis on the interplay between operator structure and the semi-inner product induced by positive operators.</description>

      <title>A monomial basis for the holomorphic functions on certain Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that the monomials form a basis for the space of holomorphic functions $(\mathcal{H}(Z), \tau_0)$, where $Z$ denotes either the space $c_0\left(\bigoplus^\infty_{i=1}\ell^i_p \right)$ for some $p\in [1, \infty)$, or the space $d_*(w,1)$, which is the predual of the Lorentz sequence space $d(w,1)$. To achieve this, we first define a fundamental system of compact subsets in $Z$, and, based on this characterization, construct a family of seminorms that generate the topology $\tau_0$ in $\mathcal{H}(Z)$. The present work is motivated by the results of Dineen and Mujica in \cite{DM}, where it was shown that the monomials form a Schauder basis for the space $\mathcal{H}(c_0)$ and $\mathcal{H}_b(c_0)$ endowed with its natural topology.</description>

      <title>On amenability constants of Fourier algebras: new bounds and new examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group. If $G$ is finite then the amenability constant of its Fourier algebra, denoted by ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$, admits an explicit formula [Johnson, JLMS 1994]; if $G$ is infinite then no such formula for ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$ is known, although lower and upper bounds were established by Runde [PAMS 2006]. Using non-abelian Fourier analysis, we obtain a sharper upper bound for ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$ when $G$ is discrete. Combining this with previous work of the first author [Choi, IMRN 2023], we exhibit new examples of discrete groups and compact groups where ${\rm AM}({\rm A}(G))$ can be calculated explicitly; previously this was only known for groups that are products of finite groups with ``degenerate'' cases. Our new examples also provide additional evidence to support the conjecture that Runde's lower bound for the amenability constant is in fact an equality.</description>

Abstract: Each continuous action of a countably infinite discrete group $\Gamma$ on a compact metrizable space X induces a continuous action of $\Gamma$ on the space M(X) of Borel probability measures on X. We compare the local entropy theory for these two actions, and describe the relation between their IE-tuples. Several other types of tuples are also studied. Our main tool is a new combinatorial lemma. We also give an application of the combinatorial lemma to the local theory of Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a bounded domain of class $C^{2+\alpha}$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. We show that if $u$ is the maximal solution of $\Delta u = 4\exp(2u)$, which tends to $+\infty$ as $(x,y)\to\partial\Omega$, then the hyperbolic radius $v=\exp(-u)$ is of class $C^{2+\alpha}$ up to the boundary. The proof relies on new Schauder estimates for Fuchsian elliptic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cyclicity of polynomials in Poletsky-Stessin weighted Bergman spaces on various domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$, including the unit ball, the bidisk, and the complex ellipsoid. To this end, we introduce a natural extension of the parameter range for Poletsky-Stessin weighted Bergman spaces on complete Reinhardt domains, yielding a family of spaces that resemble Dirichlet-type spaces on the unit ball. We highlight the differences in the cyclicity behavior of polynomials in these spaces on the bidisk compared to those studied by B\'en\'eteau et al. Finally, we propose several open problems concerning the structure of cyclic polynomials in these spaces.</description>

      <title>Hilbert manifold structures on path spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Floer theory one has to deal with two-level manifolds like for instance the space of $W^{2,2}$ loops and the space of $W^{1,2}$ loops. Gradient flow lines in Floer theory are then trajectories in a two-level manifold. Inspired by our endeavor to find a general setup to construct Floer homology we therefore address in this paper the question if the space of paths on a two-level manifold has itself the structure of a Hilbert manifold. In view of the two topologies on a two-level manifold it is unclear how to define the exponential map on a general two-level manifold. We therefore study a different approach how to define charts on path spaces of two-level manifolds. To make this approach work we need an additional structure on a two-level manifold which we refer to as tameness. We introduce the notion of tame maps and show that the composition of tame is tame again. Therefore it makes sense to introduce the notion of a tame two-level manifold. The main result of this paper shows that the path spaces on tame two-level manifolds have the structure of a Hilbert manifold.</description>

Abstract: Let $q&gt;1$, $(1-\frac{1}{q})a\geq 1$ and let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be Lipschitz domain. We show that planar mappings in the second order Sobolev space $f\in W^{2,q}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $|J_f|^{-a}\in L^1(\Omega)$ are homeomorphism if they agree with a homeomorphism on the boundary. The condition $(1-\frac{1}{q})a\geq 1$ is sharp. We also have a new sharp result about the $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$ measure of the projection of the set $\{J_f=0\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>An exact solution of planar QCD by a complex matrix ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the planar QCD loop equation in four-dimensional Euclidean space using a novel matrix-valued momentum loop formalism. Central to this construction is a new loop calculus, where functional derivatives act on the loop velocity $\dot C(\theta)$. This framework yields finite, well-defined expressions for point and area derivatives in loop space and highlights the role of the loop-space Bianchi identity in ensuring consistency with gauge theory.
  The Wilson loop is represented as an average over matrix-valued momentum loops $P(\theta)$ tracing closed paths in a compact complex manifold constrained by self-duality and boundary conditions. These random walks are governed by a measure supported on such manifolds. The self-duality conditions ensure the vanishing of the classical Yang--Mills term in the loop equation, while additional constraints eliminate the contact terms in the planar ($N \to \infty$) limit.
  A key structural feature of the solution is its invariance under reflection--conjugation symmetry: reversing loop orientation and taking complex conjugation maps a solution to another. This holds for arbitrary compact Lie groups used in the momentum ensemble and is independent of the original SU($N$) gauge group.
  We conjecture that, in the classical limit, the matrix ensemble defines a generalized minimal surface embedded not in $\mathbb{R}^4$ but in a higher-dimensional matrix space. This (hypothetical) extended surface has self-dual area elements and satisfies the loop equation via geometry and the Bianchi identity.</description>

On the other hand, for $s\in[0,1]$ such that the map $x\mapsto x^s g(x)$ is positive and decreasing, then $ \text{Tr}[ g(A) (A^{1/2} B A^{1/2} )^s ] \leq \text{Tr}[ g(A) A^s B^s ]$.</description>

Abstract: In a variety of applications, the problem comes up of describing the principal part of the inverse of a holomorphic operator at an eigenvalue in terms of left and right root functions associated to the eigenvalue. Such a description was given by Keldysh in 1951. His theorem, the proof of which was published only in 1971, is a fundamental result in the local spectral theory of operator-valued functions. Here we present a streamlined derivation in the matrix case, and we extend Keldysh's theorem by means of a new principal part formula. Special attention is given to the semisimple case (first-order poles).</description>

Abstract: $E$-frames are a new generalization for the concept of frames for $\mathcal{H}$, where $E$ is an infinite invertible complex matrix mapping on $\bigoplus_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{H}$. This article is dedicated to investigating some notions related to $E$-Bessel sequences and $E$-multipliers. A Multiplier is an operator created by frame-like analysis, multiplication with a fixed sequence, called the symbol, and synthesis. In this article, we introduce the notion of $E$-multipliers, which generalizes multipliers for $E$-sequences and study their properties, including boundedness and invertibility.</description>

      <title>The affine group of a local field is Hermitian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether the group $\mathbb{Q}_p \rtimes \mathbb{Q}_p^*$ is Hermitian has been stated as an open question in multiple sources in the literature, even as recently as a paper by R. Palma published in 2015. In this note we confirm that this group is Hermitian by proving the following more general theorem: given any local field $\mathbb{K}$, the affine group $\mathbb{K} \rtimes \mathbb{K}^*$ is a Hermitian group. The proof is a consequence of results about Hermitian Banach $*$-algebras from the 1970's. In the case that $\mathbb{K}$ is a non-archimedean local field, this result produces examples of totally disconnected locally compact Hermitian groups with exponential growth, and these are the first examples of groups satisfying these properties. This answers a second question of Palma about the existence of such groups.</description>

      <title>Fourier Multipliers on Quasi-Banach Orlicz Spaces and Orlicz Modulation Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that if a Fourier multiplier is continuous from $L^{\Phi_1}$ to $L^{\Phi_2}$, then it is also continuous from $M^{\Phi_1,\Psi}$ to $M^{\Phi_2,\Psi}$, where $\Phi_1,\Phi_2,\Psi$ are quasi-Young functions and $\Phi_1$ fulfills the $\Delta_2$-condition. This result is applied to show that Mihlin's Fourier multiplier theorem and H\"ormander's improvement hold in certain Orlicz modulation spaces. Lastly, we show that the Fourier multiplier with symbol $m(\xi) = e^{i \mu(\xi)}$, where $\mu$ is homogeneous of order $\alpha$, is bounded on quasi-Banach Orlicz modulation spaces of order $r$, assuming $r\in\big(d/(d+2),1\big]$ and $\alpha\in\big(d(1-r)/r, 2\big]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we analyze the Lebesgue exponents $p_\Phi$ and $q_\Phi$, and show that for any $p_\Phi&lt; p &lt; \infty$ and $1&lt; q&lt;q_\Phi$, there exists an equivalent Young function $\Psi$ with $p &lt; p_\Psi &lt; \infty$ and $1&lt;q_\Psi &lt; q$. This type of construction is used to improve upon the inclusions $L^{p_\Phi}\cap L^{q_\Phi}\subseteq L^\Phi \subseteq L^{p_\Phi} + L^{q_\Phi}$. For trace type Orlicz spaces $L^{\Phi,\Phi}$, we find that when $\Phi \in \Delta_2$, we have $L^{\Phi,\Phi} \subseteq L^\Phi$ if and only if $\Phi(||f||_{L^\Phi}) \le C \rho_\Phi(f)$ for all $f\in L^\Phi$, and the reverse inclusion is equivalent to the reversed inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of the best uniform approximation by linear combinations of a finite system of functions. If the system is Chebyshev and the problem is unconstrained, then the classical Remez algorithm provides a fast and precise solution. For non-Chebyshev systems, this problem may offer a great resistance. The same happens to approximations under linear constraints. We propose a solution by modifying the concept of alternance and of the Remez iterative procedure. A criterion of the best approximation is proved and the full set of polynomials of best approximation (which may not be unique in the non-Chebyshev case) is characterized. The method of finding the best polynomial is applicable for arbitrary functional systems under arbitrary linear constraints. The efficiency is demonstrated in examples with systems of complex exponents, Gaussian functions, and lacunar polynomials. As an application, the Markov-Bernstein type inequalities are obtained for those systems. Applications to signal processing, linear ODEs, switching dynamical systems are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of the barycenter of a signed distribution of probability measures on a Hilbert space. The barycenter is found, as usual, as a minimum of a functional. In the case where the positive part of the signed measure is atomic, we can show also uniqueness. In the one-dimensional case, we characterize the quantile function of the unique minimum as the orthogonal projection of the $L^2$-barycenter of the quantiles on the cone of nonincreasing functions in $L^2(0,1)$. Further, we provide a stability estimate in dimension one and a counterexample to uniqueness in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Finally, we address the consistency of the barycenters and we prove that barycenters of a sequence of approximating measures converge (up to subsequences) to a barycenter of the limit measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between entropy and Wasserstein distance in free probability theory. In particular, we give lower bounds for several versions of free entropy dimension along Wasserstein geodesics, as well as study their topological properties with respect to Wasserstein distance. We also study moment measures in the multivariate free setting, showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a regularized version of Santambrogio's variational problem. The role of probability distributions in these results is played by types, functionals which assign values not only to polynomial test functions, but to all real-valued logical formulas built from them using suprema and infima. We give an explicit counterexample showing that in the framework of non-commutative laws, the usual notion of probability distributions using only non-commutative polynomial test functions, one cannot obtain the desired large-$n$ limiting behavior for both Wasserstein distance and entropy simultaneously in random multi-matrix models.</description>

Abstract: A complete classification of \(\mathrm{SL}(n)\) contravariant, \(p\)-order tensor valuations on convex polytopes in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) for \( n \geq p \) is established without imposing additional assumptions, particularly omitting any symmetry requirements on the tensors. Beyond recovering known symmetric tensor valuations, our classification reveals asymmetric counterparts associated with the cross tensor and the Levi-Civita tensor.
