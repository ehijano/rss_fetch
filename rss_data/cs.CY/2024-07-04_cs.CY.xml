      <title>Uplifting Lower-Income Data: Strategies for Socioeconomic Perspective Shifts in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address this issue, we formulate translated non-English, geographic, and socioeconomic integrated prompts and evaluate their impact on VL model performance for data from different countries and income groups. Our findings show that geographic and socioeconomic integrated prompts improve VL performance on lower-income data and favor the retrieval of topic appearances commonly found in data from low-income households. From our analyses, we identify and highlight contexts where these strategies yield the most improvements. Our model analysis code is publicly available at https://github.com/Anniejoan/Uplifting-Lower-income-data .</description>

      <title>Practical Guide for Causal Pathways and Sub-group Disparity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the application of causal disparity analysis to unveil intricate relationships and causal pathways between sensitive attributes and the targeted outcomes within real-world observational data. Our methodology involves employing causal decomposition analysis to quantify and examine the causal interplay between sensitive attributes and outcomes. We also emphasize the significance of integrating heterogeneity assessment in causal disparity analysis to gain deeper insights into the impact of sensitive attributes within specific sub-groups on outcomes. Our two-step investigation focuses on datasets where race serves as the sensitive attribute. The results on two datasets indicate the benefit of leveraging causal analysis and heterogeneity assessment not only for quantifying biases in the data but also for disentangling their influences on outcomes. We demonstrate that the sub-groups identified by our approach to be affected the most by disparities are the ones with the largest ML classification errors. We also show that grouping the data only based on a sensitive attribute is not enough, and through these analyses, we can find sub-groups that are directly affected by disparities. We hope that our findings will encourage the adoption of such methodologies in future ethical AI practices and bias audits, fostering a more equitable and fair technological landscape.</description>

      <title>AI in Action: Accelerating Progress Towards the Sustainable Development Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are helping tackle a growing number of societal challenges, demonstrating technology's increasing capability to address complex issues, including those outlined in the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite global efforts, 80 percent of SDG targets have deviated, stalled, or regressed, and only 15 percent are on track as of 2023, illustrating the urgency of accelerating efforts to meet the goals by 2030. We draw on Google's internal and collaborative research, technical work, and social impact initiatives to show AI's potential to accelerate action on the SDGs and make substantive progress to help address humanity's most pressing challenges. The paper highlights AI capabilities (including computer vision, generative AI, natural language processing, and multimodal AI) and showcases how AI is altering how we approach problem-solving across all 17 SDGs through use cases, with a spotlight on AI-powered innovation in health, education, and climate. We then offer insights on AI development and deployment to drive bold and responsible innovation, enhance impact, close the accessibility gap, and ensure that everyone, everywhere, can benefit from AI.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Cross-sectoral Intersecting Discrepancies within Multiple Groups Using Latent Class Analysis Towards Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including EVENS and Census 2021 (England \&amp; Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between minority ethnic groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in real-world AI applications. Additionally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to provide insights into the fairness of machine learning.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Class Fairness in Classification with A Two-Player Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed in some downstream tasks, data augmentation may introduce an unfair impact on classifications. While it can improve the performance of some classes, it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose a FAir Classification approach with a Two-player game (FACT). We first formulate the training of a classifier with data augmentation as a fair optimization problem, which can be further written as an adversarial two-player game. Following this formulation, we propose a novel multiplicative weight optimization algorithm, for which we theoretically prove that it can converge to a solution that is fair over classes. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that this fairness issue over classes is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the performance of our learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes in five datasets, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.</description>

      <title>Holistic view of the road transportation system based on real-time data sharing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional manual driving and single-vehicle-based intelligent driving have limitations in real-time and accurate acquisition of the current driving status and intentions of surrounding vehicles, leading to vehicles typically maintaining appropriate safe distances from each other. Yet, accidents still frequently occur, especially in merging areas; meanwhile, it is difficult to comprehensively obtain the conditions of road infrastructure. These limitations not only restrict the further improvement of road capacity but also result in irreparable losses of life and property. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper constructs a space-time global view of the road traffic system based on a real-time sharing mechanism, enabling both road users and managers to timely access the driving intentions of nearby vehicles and the real-time status of road infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Cutting through the noise to motivate people: A comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 social media posts de/motivating vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant weaknesses in the healthcare information system. The overwhelming volume of misinformation on social media and other socioeconomic factors created extraordinary challenges to motivate people to take proper precautions and get vaccinated. In this context, our work explored a novel direction by analyzing an extensive dataset collected over two years, identifying the topics de/motivating the public about COVID-19 vaccination. We analyzed these topics based on time, geographic location, and political orientation. We noticed that while the motivating topics remain the same over time and geographic location, the demotivating topics rapidly. We also identified that intrinsic motivation, rather than external mandate, is more advantageous to inspire the public. This study addresses scientific communication and public motivation in social media. It can help public health officials, policymakers, and social media platforms develop more effective messaging strategies to cut through the noise of misinformation and educate the public about scientific findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last year or so and going back many decades there has been extensive claims by major computational scientists, engineers, and others that AGI, artificial general intelligence, is five or ten years away, but without a scintilla of scientific evidence, for a broad body of these claims. Computers will become conscious, have a theory of mind, think and reason, will become more intelligent than humans, and so on. But the claims are science fiction, not science. This article reviews evidence for the following three propositions using extensive body of scientific research and related sources from the cognitive and neurosciences, evolutionary evidence, linguistics, data science, comparative psychology, self-driving cars, robotics. and the learning sciences. (1) Do computing machines think or reason? (2) Are computing machines sentient or conscious? (3) Do computing machines have a theory of mind?</description>

      <title>A False Sense of Safety: Unsafe Information Leakage in 'Safe' AI Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaks$\unicode{x2013}$methods to elicit harmful or generally impermissible outputs. Safety measures are developed and assessed on their effectiveness at defending against jailbreak attacks, indicating a belief that safety is equivalent to robustness. We assert that current defense mechanisms, such as output filters and alignment fine-tuning, are, and will remain, fundamentally insufficient for ensuring model safety. These defenses fail to address risks arising from dual-intent queries and the ability to composite innocuous outputs to achieve harmful goals. To address this critical gap, we introduce an information-theoretic threat model called inferential adversaries who exploit impermissible information leakage from model outputs to achieve malicious goals. We distinguish these from commonly studied security adversaries who only seek to force victim models to generate specific impermissible outputs. We demonstrate the feasibility of automating inferential adversaries through question decomposition and response aggregation. To provide safety guarantees, we define an information censorship criterion for censorship mechanisms, bounding the leakage of impermissible information. We propose a defense mechanism which ensures this bound and reveal an intrinsic safety-utility trade-off. Our work provides the first theoretically grounded understanding of the requirements for releasing safe LLMs and the utility costs involved.</description>

      <title>Change My Frame: Reframing in the Wild in r/ChangeMyView</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in reframing, within the scope of text style transfer, has so far made use of out-of-context, task-prompted utterances in order to produce neutralizing or optimistic reframes. Our work aims to generalize reframing based on the subreddit r/ChangeMyView (CMV). We build a dataset that leverages CMV's community's interactions and conventions to identify high-value, community-recognized utterances that produce changes of perspective. With this data, we widen the scope of the direction of reframing since the changes in perspective do not only occur in neutral or positive directions. We fine tune transformer-based models, make use of a modern LLM to refine our dataset, and explore challenges in the dataset creation and evaluation around this type of reframing.</description>

      <title>Supporters and Skeptics: LLM-based Analysis of Engagement with Mental Health (Mis)Information Content on Video-sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over one in five adults in the US lives with a mental illness. In the face of a shortage of mental health professionals and offline resources, online short-form video content has grown to serve as a crucial conduit for disseminating mental health help and resources. However, the ease of content creation and access also contributes to the spread of misinformation, posing risks to accurate diagnosis and treatment. Detecting and understanding engagement with such content is crucial to mitigating their harmful effects on public health. We perform the first quantitative study of the phenomenon using YouTube Shorts and Bitchute as the sites of study. We contribute MentalMisinfo, a novel labeled mental health misinformation (MHMisinfo) dataset of 739 videos (639 from Youtube and 100 from Bitchute) and 135372 comments in total, using an expert-driven annotation schema. We first found that few-shot in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) are effective in detecting MHMisinfo videos. Next, we discover distinct and potentially alarming linguistic patterns in how audiences engage with MHMisinfo videos through commentary on both video-sharing platforms. Across the two platforms, comments could exacerbate prevailing stigma with some groups showing heightened susceptibility to and alignment with MHMisinfo. We discuss technical and public health-driven adaptive solutions to tackling the "epidemic" of mental health misinformation online.</description>

      <title>CogErgLLM: Exploring Large Language Model Systems Design Perspective Using Cognitive Ergonomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating cognitive ergonomics with LLMs is essential for enhancing safety, reliability, and user satisfaction in human-AI interactions. Current LLM design often lacks this integration, leading to systems that may not fully align with human cognitive capabilities and limitations. Insufficient focus on incorporating cognitive science methods exacerbates biases in LLM outputs, while inconsistent application of user-centered design principles results in sub-optimal user experiences. To address these challenges, our position paper explores the critical integration of cognitive ergonomics principles into LLM design, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework and practical guidelines for ethical LLM development. Through our contributions, we seek to advance understanding and practice in integrating cognitive ergonomics into LLM systems, fostering safer, more reliable, and ethically sound human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Understanding Turn-Taking Behavior in Open-Ended Group Activities in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In networked virtual reality (VR), user behaviors, individual differences, and group dynamics can serve as important signals into future speech behaviors, such as who the next speaker will be and the timing of turn-taking behaviors. The ability to predict and understand these behaviors offers opportunities to provide adaptive and personalized assistance, for example helping users with varying sensory abilities navigate complex social scenes and instantiating virtual moderators with natural behaviors. In this work, we predict turn-taking behaviors using features extracted based on social dynamics literature. We discuss results from a large-scale VR classroom dataset consisting of 77 sessions and 1660 minutes of small-group social interactions collected over four weeks. In our evaluation, gradient boosting classifiers achieved the best performance, with accuracies of 0.71--0.78 AUC (area under the ROC curve) across three tasks concerning the "what", "who", and "when" of turn-taking behaviors. In interpreting these models, we found that group size, listener personality, speech-related behavior (e.g., time elapsed since the listener's last speech event), group gaze (e.g., how much the group looks at the speaker), as well as the listener's and previous speaker's head pitch, head y-axis position, and left hand y-axis position more saliently influenced predictions. Results suggested that these features remain reliable indicators in novel social VR settings, as prediction performance is robust over time and with groups and activities not used in the training dataset. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the work.</description>

      <title>FairJob: A Real-World Dataset for Fairness in Online Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fairness-aware dataset for job recommendation in advertising, designed to foster research in algorithmic fairness within real-world scenarios. It was collected and prepared to comply with privacy standards and business confidentiality. An additional challenge is the lack of access to protected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a solution to obtain a proxy estimate. Despite being anonymized and including a proxy for a sensitive attribute, our dataset preserves predictive power and maintains a realistic and challenging benchmark. This dataset addresses a significant gap in the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like advertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious employment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common industrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process where unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility metric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased dataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released dataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated trade-offs with utility.</description>

      <title>A 72h exploration of the co-evolution of food insecurity and international migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Food insecurity, defined as the lack of physical or economic access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, remains one of the main challenges of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Food insecurity is a complex phenomenon, resulting from the interplay of environmental, socio-demographic, and political events. Previous work has investigated the nexus between climate change, conflict, migration and food security at the household level, however these relations are still largely unexplored at national scales. In this context, during the Complexity72h workshop, held at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in June 2024, we explored the co-evolution of international migration flows and food insecurity at the national scale, accounting for remittances, as well as for changes in the economic, conflict, and climate situation. To this aim, we gathered data from several publicly available sources (Food and Agriculture Organization, World Bank, and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) and analyzed the association between food insecurity and migration, migration and remittances, and remittances and food insecurity. We then propose a framework linking together these associations to model the co-evolution of food insecurity and international migrations.</description>

      <title>"There Has To Be a Lot That We're Missing": Moderating AI-Generated Content on Reddit</title>

Abstract: Generative AI has begun to alter how we work, learn, communicate, and participate in online communities. How might our online communities be changed by generative AI? To start addressing this question, we focused on online community moderators' experiences with AI-generated content (AIGC). We performed fifteen in-depth, semi-structured interviews with community moderators on the social sharing site Reddit to understand their attitudes towards AIGC and how their communities are responding. Our study finds communities are choosing to enact rules restricting use of AIGC for both ideological and practical reasons. We find that, despite the absence of foolproof tools for detecting AIGC, moderators were able to somewhat limit the disruption caused by this new phenomenon by working with their communities to clarify norms about AIGC use. However, moderators found enforcing AIGC restrictions challenging, and had to rely on time-intensive and inaccurate detection heuristics in their efforts. Our results highlight the importance of supporting community autonomy and self-determination in the face of this sudden technological change, and suggest potential design solutions that may help.</description>

      <title>Classifying Proposals of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study demonstrates the effective use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the classification of complex datasets. We specifically target proposals of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), as the clas-sification of this data requires the understanding of context and, therefore, depends on human expertise, leading to high costs associated with the task. The study applies an iterative approach to specify categories and further re-fine them and the prompt in each iteration, which led to an accuracy rate of 95% in classifying a set of 100 proposals. With this, we demonstrate the po-tential of LLMs to automate data labeling tasks that depend on textual con-text effectively.</description>

      <title>Are demographically invariant models and representations in medical imaging fair?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging models have been shown to encode information about patient demographics such as age, race, and sex in their latent representation, raising concerns about their potential for discrimination. Here, we ask whether requiring models not to encode demographic attributes is desirable. We point out that marginal and class-conditional representation invariance imply the standard group fairness notions of demographic parity and equalized odds, respectively. In addition, however, they require matching the risk distributions, thus potentially equalizing away important group differences. Enforcing the traditional fairness notions directly instead does not entail these strong constraints. Moreover, representationally invariant models may still take demographic attributes into account for deriving predictions, implying unequal treatment - in fact, achieving representation invariance may require doing so. In theory, this can be prevented using counterfactual notions of (individual) fairness or invariance. We caution, however, that properly defining medical image counterfactuals with respect to demographic attributes is fraught with challenges. Finally, we posit that encoding demographic attributes may even be advantageous if it enables learning a task-specific encoding of demographic features that does not rely on social constructs such as 'race' and 'gender.' We conclude that demographically invariant representations are neither necessary nor sufficient for fairness in medical imaging. Models may need to encode demographic attributes, lending further urgency to calls for comprehensive model fairness assessments in terms of predictive performance across diverse patient groups.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware Federated Minimax Optimization with Convergence Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04417v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has garnered considerable attention due to its privacy-preserving feature. Nonetheless, the lack of freedom in managing user data can lead to group fairness issues, where models are biased towards sensitive factors such as race or gender. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, fair federated averaging with augmented Lagrangian method (FFALM), designed explicitly to address group fairness issues in FL. Specifically, we impose a fairness constraint on the training objective and solve the minimax reformulation of the constrained optimization problem. Then, we derive the theoretical upper bound for the convergence rate of FFALM. The effectiveness of FFALM in improving fairness is shown empirically on CelebA and UTKFace datasets in the presence of severe statistical heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>What's color got to do with it? Face recognition in grayscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art deep CNN face matchers are typically created using extensive training sets of color face images. Our study reveals that such matchers attain virtually identical accuracy when trained on either grayscale or color versions of the training set, even when the evaluation is done using color test images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that shallower models, lacking the capacity to model complex representations, rely more heavily on low-level features such as those associated with color. As a result, they display diminished accuracy when trained with grayscale images. We then consider possible causes for deeper CNN face matchers "not seeing color". Popular web-scraped face datasets actually have 30 to 60% of their identities with one or more grayscale images. We analyze whether this grayscale element in the training set impacts the accuracy achieved, and conclude that it does not. We demonstrate that using only grayscale images for both training and testing achieves accuracy comparable to that achieved using only color images for deeper models. This holds true for both real and synthetic training datasets. HSV color space, which separates chroma and luma information, does not improve the network's learning about color any more than in the RGB color space. We then show that the skin region of an individual's images in a web-scraped training set exhibits significant variation in their mapping to color space. This suggests that color carries limited identity-specific information. We also show that when the first convolution layer is restricted to a single filter, models learn a grayscale conversion filter and pass a grayscale version of the input color image to the next layer. Finally, we demonstrate that leveraging the lower per-image storage for grayscale to increase the number of images in the training set can improve accuracy of the face recognition model.</description>

      <title>Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate and revise text with human-level performance, and have been widely commercialized in systems like ChatGPT. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists have been using them to assist their scholarly writing. How wide-spread is LLM usage in the academic literature currently? To answer this question, we use an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage. We study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. Our analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30% for some PubMed sub-corpora. We show that the appearance of LLM-based writing assistants has had an unprecedented impact in the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

      <title>Wearable Device-Based Real-Time Monitoring of Physiological Signals: Evaluating Cognitive Load Across Different Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study employs cutting-edge wearable monitoring technology to conduct high-precision, high-temporal-resolution (1-second interval) cognitive load assessment on electroencephalogram (EEG) data from the FP1 channel and heart rate variability (HRV) data of secondary vocational students. By jointly analyzing these two critical physiological indicators, the research delves into their application value in assessing cognitive load among secondary vocational students and their utility across various tasks. The study designed two experiments to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach: Initially, a random forest classification model, developed using the N-BACK task, enabled the precise decoding of physiological signal characteristics in secondary vocational students under different levels of cognitive load, achieving a classification accuracy of 97%. Subsequently, this classification model was applied in a cross-task experiment involving the National Computer Rank Examination (Level-1), demonstrating the method's significant applicability and cross-task transferability in diverse learning contexts. Conducted with high portability, this research holds substantial theoretical and practical significance for optimizing teaching resource allocation in secondary vocational education, as well as for cognitive load assessment methods and monitoring. Currently, the research findings are undergoing trial implementation in the school.</description>

      <title>Commodification of Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and cloud computing have precipitated an unprecedented demand for computational resources. However, the current landscape of computational resource allocation is characterized by significant inefficiencies, including underutilization and price volatility. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel global platform for the commodification of compute hours, termed the Global Compute Exchange (GCX) (Patent Pending). The GCX leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace for buying and selling computational power. The GCX is built in a layered fashion, comprising Market, App, Clearing, Risk Management, Exchange (Offchain), and Blockchain (Onchain) layers, each ensuring a robust and efficient operation. This platform aims to revolutionize the computational resource market by fostering a decentralized, efficient, and transparent ecosystem that ensures equitable access to computing power, stimulates innovation, and supports diverse user needs on a global scale. By transforming compute hours into a tradable commodity, the GCX seeks to optimize resource utilization, stabilize pricing, and democratize access to computational resources. This paper explores the technological infrastructure, market potential, and societal impact of the GCX, positioning it as a pioneering solution poised to drive the next wave of innovation in commodities and compute.</description>

      <title>Private Hierarchical Governance for Encrypted Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing harms caused by hate, harassment, and other forms of abuse online have motivated major platforms to explore hierarchical governance. The idea is to allow communities to have designated members take on moderation and leadership duties; meanwhile, members can still escalate issues to the platform. But these promising approaches have only been explored in plaintext settings where community content is public to the platform. It is unclear how one can realize hierarchical governance in the huge and increasing number of online communities that utilize end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging for privacy.
  We propose private hierarchical governance systems. These should enable similar levels of community governance as in plaintext settings, while maintaining cryptographic privacy of content and governance actions not reported to the platform. We design the first such system, taking a layered approach that adds governance logic on top of an encrypted messaging protocol; we show how an extension to the message layer security (MLS) protocol suffices for achieving a rich set of governance policies. Our approach allows developers to rapidly prototype new governance features, taking inspiration from a plaintext system called PolicyKit. We build a prototype E2EE messaging system called MlsGov that supports content-based community and platform moderation, elections of community moderators, votes to remove abusive users, and more.</description>
