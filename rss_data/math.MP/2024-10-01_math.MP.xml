      <title>Electrostatic force between two charged spherical conductors in an electric field: Matched asymptotic expansion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we derive the asymptotic expressions for the electrostatic force between two charged spherical conductors in an electric field. Davis \cite{davis1964two} initially provided an expression for these forces, which are split into components along the X and Z directions. These forces are influenced by several factors, including the separation distance between the spheres, their sizes, their charges, the applied external electric field, and 10 specific force coefficients. These coefficients involve complex series expressions, and computing them requires summing up the 24 infinite series. To tackle the challenge of series convergence, previous researchers (\cite{lekner2012electrostatics}, \cite{lekner2013forces}, \cite{arp1977particle}) have used various methods to derive asymptotic expressions. In this work, the method of matched asymptotic expansions has been implemented to derive the asymptotic forms of these 24 series, specifically for the scenario involving two equal-sized conducting spheres in an external electric field. Accurate calculation of these series is crucial, especially when the distance between the spheres is very small, making the series calculations computationally intensive. We utilize the method proposed by Cox and Brenner \cite{Cox1967} to derive the asymptotic expressions and hence compute the 10 force coefficients and finally apply them to compute the electrostatic force for small separations. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of these asymptotic expressions by comparing them to the actual series and analyzing their deviations through percentage errors.</description>

      <title>Periodic boundary conditions on staggered grids: Uniqueness of variables at cell edges/faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic boundary conditions when applied to staggered grids, which define variables on both cell edges and cell centers, can be shown to have a problem with uniqueness of variables at cell edges depending on the number of points in the direction of periodicity. In the context of the grid defined in this work, it can be shown that uniqueness is guaranteed if and only if the number of points in the periodic direction are odd. This stems from the rank of the matrix with dimensions (N-2) x (N-2) that transforms the values at cell centers to values at edges. This matrix is full rank if and only if N is odd. Here, N is the number of points describing the cell edges.</description>

      <title>On the maximal superintegrability of strongly isochronous Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strongly isochronous Hamiltonians that generate periodic time evolution with the same basic period for a dense set of initial values. We explain that all such Hamiltonians are maximally superintegrable, and show that if the system is subjected to Hamiltonian reduction based on a compact symmetry group and certain conditions are met, then the reduced Hamiltonian is strongly isochronous with the original basic period. We utilize these simple observations for demonstrating the maximal superintegrability of rational spin Calogero--Moser type models in confining harmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Zeros of planar Ising models via flat SU(2) connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Livine and Bonzom recently proposed a geometric formula for a certain set of complex zeros of the partition function of the Ising model defined on planar graphs. Remarkably, the zeros depend locally on the geometry of an immersion of the graph in the three dimensional Euclidean space (different immersions give rise to different zeros). When restricted to the flat case, the weights become the critical weights on circle patterns.
  We rigorously prove the formula by geometrically constructing a null eigenvector of the Kac-Ward matrix whose determinant is the squared partition function. The main ingredient of the proof is the realisation that the associated Kac-Ward transition matrix gives rise to an SU(2) connection on the graph, creating a direct link with rotations in three dimensions. The existence of a null eigenvector turns out to be equivalent to this connection being flat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac operator is considered on a bidimensional domain whose boundary carries the infinite mass boundary condition. The analysis is focused on the existence of discrete spectrum and on its asymptotic description in the thin width limit. We revisit a recent result by using an alternative view point inspired by microlocal analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Patterns: Approximate Resurgent Resummation from Truncated Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze truncated series generated as divergent formal solutions of non-linear ordinary differential equations. Motivating the study is a specific non-linear, first-order differential equation, which is the basis of the resurgent formulation of renormalized perturbation theory in quantum field theory. We use the Borel-Pad\'e approximant and classical analysis to determine the analytic structure of the solution using the first few terms of its asymptotic series. Afterward, we build an approximant, consistent with the resurgent properties of the equation. The procedure gives an approximate expression for the Borel-Ecalle resummation of the solution useful for practical applications. Connections with other physical applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive structures, braces &amp; the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is reviewed from a purely algebraic point of view. We recall certain algebraic structures called shelves, racks and quandles. These objects satisfy a self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We also recall that non-involutive solutions of the braid equation are obtained from shelf and rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all involutive set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the flip map via a parametric twist. The notion of braces is also presented as the suitable algebraic structure associated to involutive set-theoretic solutions. The quantum algebra as well as the integrability of Baxterized involutive set-theoretic solutions is also discussed. The explicit form of the Drinfel'd twist is presented allowing the derivation of general set-theoretic solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of fractional order parameter $(\alpha)$ in nonlinear waves is examined in the fractional Zakharov-Kuznetsov (FZK) equation with the Hirota bilinear approach. Symbolic computation is used for all mathematical calculations. A significant impact of the fractional order parameter is found on the single and multi-soliton solutions. The fact that the structural change is noticeable when $\alpha$ is raised, is crucial to our investigation.</description>

      <title>On 4D, ${\mathcal{N}=2}$ deformed vector multiplets and partial supersymmetry breaking in off-shell supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic Fayet-Ilioupulous (FI) terms are used to engineer partial breaking of ${\mathcal{N}=2}$ global supersymmetry for systems of vector multiplets. The magnetic FI term induces a deformation of the off-shell field transformations associated with an imaginary constant shift of the triplet of auxiliary fields of the vector multiplet. In this paper, we elaborate on the deformation of off-shell vector multiplets in supergravity, both in components and superspace. In a superconformal framework, the deformations are associated with (composite) linear multiplets. We engineer an off-shell model that exhibits partial local supersymmetry breaking with a zero cosmological constant. This is based on the hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet introduced in arXiv:2203.12203, coupled to the SU(1,1)/U(1) special-K\"ahler sigma model in a symplectic frame admitting a holomorphic prepotential, with one compensating and one physical vector multiplet, the latter magnetically deformed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss some results on integrable Hamiltonian systems with two coordinate variables. We revisit the much-studied problem of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and discuss its (super)integrability in the light of a canonical transformation which can map the anisotropic oscillator to a corresponding isotropic one. Following this, we discuss the computation of first integrals for integrable two-dimensional systems using the framework of the Jacobi last multiplier. Using the latter, we describe some novel physical examples, namely, the classical Landau problem with a scalar-potential-induced hyperbolic mode, the two-dimensional Kepler problem, and a problem involving a linear curl force.</description>

      <title>Cyclic random graph models predicting giant molecules in hydrocarbon pyrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrocarbon pyrolysis is a complex chemical reaction system at extreme temperature and pressure conditions involving large numbers of chemical reactions and chemical species. Only two kinds of atoms are involved: carbons and hydrogens. Its effective description and predictions for new settings are challenging due to the complexity of the system and the high computational cost of generating data by molecular dynamics simulations. On the other hand, the ensemble of molecules present at any moment and the carbon skeletons of these molecules can be viewed as random graphs. Therefore, an adequate random graph model can predict molecular composition at a low computational cost. We propose a random graph model featuring disjoint loops and assortativity correction and a method for learning input distributions from molecular dynamics data. The model uses works of Karrer and Newman (2010) and Newman (2002) as building blocks. We demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the size distribution for small molecules as well as the size distribution of the largest molecule in reaction systems at the pressure of 40.5 GPa, temperature range of 3200K-5000K, and H/C ratio range from 2.25 as in octane through 4 as in methane.</description>

      <title>Boundary Integral Formulations for Flexural Wave Scattering in Thin Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop second kind integral formulations for flexural wave scattering problems involving the clamped, free, and supported plate boundary conditions. While the clamped plate problem can be solved with layer potentials previously developed for the biharmonic equation [1], the free plate problem is more difficult due to the complex nature of the boundary conditions. In this paper we describe a representation for the free plate problem that uses the Hilbert transform to cancel singularities of certain layer potentials, ultimately leading to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Additionally, for the supported plate problem, we improve on an existing representation to obtain a second kind integral equation. With these representations, it is possible to solve flexural wave scattering problems with high-order-accurate methods, examine the far-field patterns of scattering objects, and solve large problems involving multiple scatterers.</description>

      <title>Toda field theories and Calogero models associated to infinite Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many integrable theories can be formulated universally in terms of Lie algebraic root systems. Well-studied are conformally invariant scalar field theories of Toda type and their massive versions, which can be expressed in terms of simple roots of finite Lie and affine Kac-Moody algebras, respectively. Also, multi-particle systems of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland type, which require the entire root system in their formulation, are extensively studied. Here, we discuss recently proposed extensions of these models to similar systems based on hyperbolic and Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras. We explore various properties of these models, including their integrability and their invariance with respect to infinite Weyl groups of affine, hyperbolic, and Lorentzian types.</description>

      <title>Idempotent approach to level-2 variational principles in Thermodynamical Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an idempotent pressure to level-2 functions and its associated density entropy. All this is related to idempotent pressure functions which is the natural concept that corresponds to the meaning of probability in the level-2 max-plus context. In this general framework the equilibrium states, maximizing the variational principle, are not unique. We investigate the connections with the general convex pressure introduced recently to level-1 functions by Bi\'{s}, Carvalho, Mendes and Varandas. Our general setting contemplates the dynamical and not dynamical framework. We also study a characterization of the density entropy in order to get an idempotent pressure invariant by dynamical systems acting on probabilities; this is therefore a level-2 result. We are able to produce idempotent pressure functions at level-2 which are invariant by the dynamics of the pushforward map via a form of Ruelle operator.</description>

      <title>Particle approximations of Wigner distributions for n arbitrary observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of signed joint probability measures for n arbitrary quantum observables is derived and studied based on quasi-characteristic functions with symmetrized operator orderings of Margenau-Hill type. It is shown that the Wigner distribution associated with these observables can be rigorously approximated by such measures. These measures are given by affine combinations of Dirac delta distributions supported over the finite spectral range of the quantum observables and give the correct probability marginals when coarse-grained along any principal axis. We specialize to bivariate quasi-probability distributions for the spin measurements of spin-1/2 particles and derive their closed-form expressions. As a side result, we point out a connection between the convergence of these particle approximations and the Mehler-Heine theorem. Finally, we interpret the supports of these quasi-probability distributions in terms of repeated thought experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions of non-absorbing Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider reversible ergodic Markov chains with finite state space, and we introduce a new notion of quasi-stationary distribution that does not require the presence of any absorbing state. In our setting, the hitting time of the absorbing set is replaced by an optimal strong stationary time, representing the ``hitting time of the stationary distribution''. On the one hand, we show that our notion of quasi-stationary distribution corresponds to the natural generalization of the \emph{Yaglom limit}. On the other hand, similarly to the classical quasi-stationary distribution, we show that it can be written in terms of the eigenvectors of the underlying Markov kernel, and it is therefore amenable of a geometric interpretation. Moreover, we recover the usual exponential behavior that characterizes quasi-stationary distributions and metastable systems. We also provide some toy examples, which show that the phenomenology is richer compared to the absorbing case. Finally, we present some counterexamples, showing that the assumption on the reversibility cannot be weakened in general.</description>

      <title>Three-to-one internal resonances in coupled harmonic oscillators with cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a general system of two coupled harmonic oscillators with cubic nonlinearity. Without damping, the system is Hamiltonian, with the origin as an elliptic equilibrium characterized by two distinct linear frequencies. To understand the dynamics, it is crucial to derive explicit analytic formulae for the nonlinear frequencies as functions of the physical parameters involved. In the small amplitude regime (perturbative case), we provide the first-order nonlinear correction to the linear frequencies. While this analytic expression was already derived for non-resonant cases, it is novel in the context of resonant or nearly resonant scenarios. Specifically, we focus on the 3:1 resonance, the only resonance involved in the first-order correction. Utilizing the Hamiltonian structure, we employ Perturbation Theory methods to transform the system into Birkhoff Normal Form up to order four. This involves converting the system into action-angle variables (symplectically rescaled polar coordinates), where the truncated Hamiltonian at order four depends on the actions and, due to the resonance, on one "slow" angle. By constructing suitable nonlinear and not close-to-the-identity coordinate transformations, we identify new sets of symplectic action-angle variables. In these variables, the resulting system is integrable up to higher-order terms, meaning it does not depend on the angles, and the frequencies are obtained from the derivatives of the energy with respect to the actions. This construction is highly dependent on the physical parameters, necessitating a detailed case analysis of the phase portrait, revealing up to six topologically distinct behaviors. As an application, we examine wave propagation in metamaterial honeycombs with periodically distributed nonlinear resonators, evaluating the nonlinear effects on the bandgap particularly in the presence of resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian last passage percolation is a classical model of integrable probability and the KPZ universality class. We consider the Brownian last passage model with a functional initial condition: $$BLPP(X;(t,m)) = \max_{0 \leq t_0 \leq t_1 \leq \cdots \leq t_m = t} X(t_0) + \sum_{k=1}^m B_k(t_k) - B_k(t_{k-1}).$$ Here $X: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ and $B_k$ are independent, standard Brownian motions. We derive a formula for finite dimensional laws of $t \mapsto BLPP(X;(t,m))$ in terms of a Fredholm determinant.</description>

      <title>Modularity of Vafa-Witten Partition Functions from SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 6d (2,0) theory of $N$ M5 branes compactified on the product geometry $T^2\times S$, where $S$ is a K\"ahler 4-manifold, can be studied in two different limits. In one limit, the size of $T^2$ is taken to zero and together with a topological twist one arrives at the Vafa-Witten partition function on $S$. On the other hand, taking the size of $S$ to zero leads to a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ theory. This gives rise to a 2d-4d correspondence where the Vafa-Witten partition functions are identified with the characters of the 2d theory. In this paper, we test this conjecture for Hirzebruch and Del Pezzo surfaces by employing the technique of SymTFT to show that the modular transformation properties of the two sides match. Moreover, we construct modular invariant 2d absolute partition functions and verify that they are invariant under gauging of a discrete symmetry at the self-dual point in coupling space. This provides further hints for the presence of duality defects in the 2d SCFT.</description>

      <title>Disordered Gibbs measures and Gaussian conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the law of a random field $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ evaluated at a random sample from the Gibbs measure associated to a Gaussian field $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$. In the high-temperature regime, we show that bounds on the probability that $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})\in A$ for $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ randomly sampled from the Gibbs measure can be deduced from similar bounds for deterministic $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ under the conditional Gaussian law given that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$ for $E$ close to the derivative $F'(\beta)$ of the free energy (which is the typical value of $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N$ under the Gibbs measure). In the more challenging low-temperature regime we restrict to $k$-RSB spherical spin glasses, proving a similar result, now with a more elaborate conditioning. Namely, with $q_i$ denoting the locations of the non-zero atoms of the Parisi measure, in addition to specifying that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$, here one needs to also condition on the energy and its gradient at points $\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_k$ such that $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j\rangle/N=q_{i\wedge j}$ and $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\sigma}\rangle/N\approx q_{i}$. Like in the high-temperature phase, the energy and gradient values on which one conditions are also specified by the model's Parisi measure. As an application, we compute the Franz-Parisi potential at any temperature. Our results are also relevant to the study of Langevin dynamics with initial conditions distributed according to the Gibbs measure, which is one of the main motivations of this work.</description>

Abstract: For axisymmetric flows without swirl, we prove the upper bound of $t^{4/3}$ for the growth of the vorticity maximum, which was conjectured by Childress [Phys. D, 2008] and supported by numerical computations from Childress--Gilbert--Valiant [J. Fluid Mech. 2016]. The key is to estimate the velocity maximum by the kinetic energy together with conserved quantities involving the vorticity.</description>

Abstract: For quasicrystals of cut-and-project type in $\mathbb{R}^d$, it was proved by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson that the limit local statistical properties of the directions to the points in the set are described by certain $\operatorname{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$-invariant point processes. In the present paper we make a detailed study of the tail asymptotics of the limiting gap statistics of the directions, for certain specific classes of planar quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Infinite cycles of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first-quantized description of bosonic systems permutation cycles formed by the particles play a fundamental role. In the ideal Bose gas Bose-Enstein condensation (BEC) is signaled by the appearance of infinite cycles. When the particles interact, the two phenomena may not be simultaneous, the existence of infinite cycles is necessary but not sufficient for BEC. We demonstrate that their appearance is always accompanied by a singularity in the thermodynamic quantities which in three and four dimensions can be as strong as a one-sided divergence of the isothermal compressibility. Arguments are presented that long-range interactions can give rise to unexpected results, such as the absence of infinite cycles in three dimensions for long-range repulsion or their presence in one and two dimensions if the pair potential has a long attractive tail.</description>

      <title>Efficient Verification of Stabilizer Code Subspaces with Local Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the task of verifying whether a quantum computer, designed to be protected by a specific stabilizer code, correctly encodes the corresponding logical qubits. To achieve this, we develop a general framework for subspace verification and explore several stabilizer code subspaces of practical significance. First, we present two efficient verification strategies for general stabilizer code subspaces, utilizing measurements of their stabilizer generators and stabilizer groups, respectively. Then, building on the observation that certain tests can be conducted in parallel when the subspace exhibits specific structural properties, we propose a coloring strategy tailored to graph code subspaces and an XZ strategy tailored to Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code subspaces. Compared to stabilizer-based strategies, these new strategies require significantly fewer measurement settings and consume fewer state copies, approaching near-global optimality. Notably, all the strategies employ a limited number of Pauli measurements, are non-adaptive, and work on mixed states, enabling efficient experimental certification of both logical qubits and logical operations in noisy quantum computers. This work contributes to the first systematic study of efficient verification of stabilizer code subspaces with local measurements.</description>

      <title>A natural requirement for objective corotational rates -- on structure preserving corotational rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate objective corotational rates satisfying an additional, physically plausible assumption. More precisely, we require for \begin{equation*} \frac{{\rm D}^{\circ}}{{\rm D} t}[B] = \mathbb{A}^{\circ}(B).D \end{equation*} that $\mathbb{A}^{\circ}(B)$ is positive definite. Here, $B = F \, F^T$ is the left Cauchy-Green tensor, $\frac{{\rm D}^{\circ}}{{\rm D}t}$ is a specific objective corotational rate, $D = {\rm sym} \, {\rm D} v$ is the Eulerian stretching and $\mathbb{A}^{\circ}(B)$ is the corresponding induced fourth order tangent stiffness tensor. Well known corotational rates like the Zaremba-Jaumann rate, the Green-Naghdi rate and the logarithmic rate belong to this family of ``positive'' corotational rates. For general objective corotational rates $\frac{{\rm D}^{\circ}}{{\rm D} t}$ we determine several conditions characterizing positivity. Among them an explicit condition on the material spin-functions of Xiao, Bruhns and Meyers (2004). We also give a geometrical motivation for invertibility and positivity and highlight the structure preserving properties of corotational rates that distinguish them from more general objective stress rates. Applications of this novel concept are indicated.</description>

      <title>Stability of vortex quadrupoles with odd-odd symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the 2D incompressible Euler equations, we establish global-in-time ($t \in \mathbb{R}$) stability of vortex quadrupoles satisfying odd symmetry with respect to both axes. Specifically, if the vorticity restricted to a quadrant is signed, sufficiently concentrated and close to its radial rearrangement up to a translation in $L^1$, we prove that it remains so for all times.
  The main difficulty is that the kinetic energy maximization problem in a quadrant -- the typical approach for establishing vortex stability -- lacks a solution, as the kinetic energy continues to increase when the vorticity escapes to infinity. We overcome this by taking dynamical information into account: finite-time desingularization result is combined with monotonicity of the first moment and a careful analysis of the interaction energies between vortices. The latter is achieved by new pointwise estimates on the Biot--Savart kernel and quantitative stability results for general interaction kernels. Moreover, with a similar strategy we obtain stability of a pair of opposite-signed Lamb dipoles moving away from each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to string sigma model whose target space is a T-dualized system from an integrable bi-hermitian space with isometry. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized almost complex structures keep integrable even though they become no longer covariantly constant. We also observe that the form of $H$-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the rate-formulation for the objective, corotational Zaremba-Jaumann rate
  \begin{align}
  \frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t} [\sigma] = \mathbb{H}^{\rm ZJ}(\sigma).D, \qquad D = {\rm sym} {\rm D} v\,,
  \end{align} operating on the Cauchy stress $\sigma$, the Eulerian strain rate $D$ and the spatial velocity $v$ with the novel \enquote{corotational stability postulate} (CSP)\begin{equation}
  \Bigl\langle \frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t}[\sigma], D \Bigr\rangle &gt; 0 \qquad \forall \, D\in{\rm Sym}(3)\setminus\{0\} \end{equation} to show that for a given isotropic Cauchy-elastic constitutive law $B \mapsto \sigma(B)$ in terms of the left Cauchy-Green tensor $B = F F^T$, the induced fourth-order tangent stiffness tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\rm ZJ}(\sigma)$ is positive definite if and only if for $\widehat{\sigma}(\log B):=\sigma(B)$, the strong monotonicity condition (TSTS-M$^{++}$) in the logarithmic strain is satisfied. Thus (CSP) implies (TSTS-M^{++}) and vice-versa, and both imply the invertibility of the hypo-elastic material law between the stress and strain rates given by the tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\rm ZJ}(\sigma)$. The same characterization remains true for the corotational Green-Naghdi rate as well as the corotational logarithmic rate, conferring the corotational stability postulate (CSP) together with the monotonicity in the logarithmic strain tensor (TSTS-M^{++}) a far reaching generality. It is conjectured that this characterization of (CSP) holds for a large class of reasonable corotational rates. The result for the logarithmic rate is based on a novel chain rule for corotational derivatives of isotropic tensor functions.</description>

      <title>Pure perimeter laws for Wilson lines observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent papers have studied the decay rate of the expectation of Wilson loop and Wilson line observables in lattice gauge theory and the lattice Higgs model. These results have all been perturbative in the sense that the parameters need to scale with the length of the loop or line for the error term to be smaller than the estimate. In this paper, we further develop ideas from~\cite{fv2023} and~\cite{f2024} to give more detailed asymptotics for the expectation of Wilson loop and Wilson line observables, which do not require the parameters to be very large or very small for the error term to be small, thus improving the results of~\cite{flv2022, flv2023, flv2020, f2022b}. In particular, we show that Wilson line and loop observables have a pure parameter law in the Higgs and confinement phases of the lattice Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Critical Points of Chi-Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give here a semi-analytic formula for the density of critical values for chi random fields on a general manifold. The result uses Kac-Rice argument and a convenient representation for the Hessian matrix of chi fields, which makes the computation of their expected determinant much more feasible. In the high-threshold limit, the expression for the expected value of critical points becomes very transparent: up to explicit constants, it amounts to Hermite polynomials times a Gaussian density. Our results are also motivated by the analysis of polarization random fields in Cosmology, but they might lead to applications in many different environments.</description>

      <title>Totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links and electromagnetic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The set of real-analytic Legendrian links with respect to the standard contact structure on the 3-sphere $S^3$ corresponds both to the set of totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links as defined by Rudolph and to the set of stable knotted field lines in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. It is known that every isotopy class has a real-analytic Legendrian representative, so that every link type $L$ admits a holomorphic function $G:\mathbb{C}^2\to\mathbb{C}$ whose zeros intersect $S^3$ tangentially in $L$ and there is a Bateman electromagnetic field $\mathbf{F}$ with closed field lines in the shape of $L$. However, so far the family of torus links are the only examples where explicit expressions of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ have been found. In this paper, we present an algorithm that finds for every given link type $L$ a real-analytic Legendrian representative, parametrised in terms of trigonometric polynomials. We then prove that (good candidates for) examples of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations, which is homogeneous in the case of $G$ and inhomogeneous in the case of $\mathbf{F}$. We also use the real-analytic Legendrian parametrisations to study the dynamics of knots in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. In particular, we show that no compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ can contain an electromagnetic knot indefinitely.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for a class of degenerate convex $\nabla \varphi$-interface models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Langevin dynamics corresponding to the $\nabla \varphi$-interface model with a degenerate convex interaction potential satisfying a polynomial growth assumption. Following the work of the author and Armstrong, we interpret these Langevin dynamics as a nonlinear parabolic equation forced by white noise and apply homogenization methods to derive a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. This result quantifies and extends to a class of degenerate convex potentials the seminal result of Funaki and Spohn. In order to handle the degeneracy of the potential, we make use of the notion of moderated environment originally introduced by Mourrat and Otto and further developed by Biskup and Rodriguez to study the properties of solutions of parabolic equations with degenerate coefficients (and of the corresponding random walks).</description>

      <title>Long-Wavelength Limit of the Two-Fluid Euler-Poisson System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma is a medium filled with free electrons and positive ions. Each particle acts as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature when electromagnetic fields are present. This distinction between the roles played by electrons and ions is what we refer to as the two$-$fluid description of plasma. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of these particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless ''Euler-Poisson'' system. Employing analytical and computational techniques from differential equations, we show this system is governed by the dynamics of the Korteweg$-$de Vries (KdV) equation in the long$-$wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>On certain noncommutative geometries via categories of sheaves of (graded) PI-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries, which include, for example, the following algebras: superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic 0 and a topological space $X$; we construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the sheaf structure belongs to the $G$-graded variety $\text{G-var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$, which classify all geometric spaces that belong to $\text{G-var}(A)$. We study conditions to compare two geometries in a (graded) Morita context, as well as their corresponding differential calculi.</description>

      <title>Generalized Minkowski spacetime with geometric algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5195</link>
      <description>arXiv:1205.5195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin from the generalised eight-dimensional Minkowski spacetime structure, previously developed in Clifford geometric algebra $ C\ell(\Re^3) $. We propose that this is the correct algebraic representation for physical three-dimensional space. We find that this representation incorporates spin and helicity directly into spacetime, in a Lorentz invariant manner. From this foundation, based on purely algebraic arguments, we derive Minkowski spacetime, the properties of electromagnetic radiation and Maxwell's equations. These results being achieved all without physical arguments, showing that these physical laws are actually purely geometric effects. This approach also leads to a generalization of complex mass and proper time. Several insight about time are produced, including an arrow of time, which ultimately becomes a five-dimensional property. We also provide a new argument explaining the non-existence of magnetic monopoles. We suggest that the rotational freedoms, inherent in three-dimensional physical space are an important aspect of nature, not properly addressed in physics, as they are not incorporated within the spacetime background, as achieved in this paper.</description>

      <title>Bethe vectors and recurrence relations for twisted Yangian based models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Olshanski twisted Yangian based models, known as one-dimensional "soliton non-preserving" open spin chains, by means of algebraic Bethe ansatz. The even case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ or $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$, was studied in arXiv:1710.08409. In the present work, we focus on the odd case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n+1}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$. We explicitly construct Bethe vectors and present a more symmetric form of the trace formula. We use the composite model approach and $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$-type recurrence relations to obtain recurrence relations for twisted Yangian based Bethe vectors, for both even and odd cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of many-body Fermi systems, for a class of initial data which are close to quasi-free states exhibiting a nonvanishing pairing matrix. We focus on the mean-field scaling, which for fermionic systems is naturally coupled with a semiclassical scaling. Under the assumption that the initial datum enjoys a suitable semiclassical structure, we give a rigorous derivation of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation, a nonlinear effective evolution equation for the one-particle density matrix of the system, as the number of particles goes to infinity. Our result holds for all macroscopic times, and provides bounds for the rate of convergence.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone modes in a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multi flavor symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three measures of the dynamical coherence of channels, which are the generalization of several previous results. The measures are based on the generalized distance function between channels, which for example could be the divergence or a trace-distance. Free operations are considered to be detection-incoherent, creation-incoherent, and detection-creation incoherent. Free superchannels can be expressed using free pre- and post-processing channels. The new measures are monotone under free superchannels and convex.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations using the metriplectic dynamics formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) systems describes flows with two-phases, e.g., a liquid with bubbles. Obtaining constitutive relations for general dissipative processes for such a systems, which are thermodynamically consistent, can be a challenge. We show how the metriplectic 4-bracket formalism achieves this in a straightforward, in fact algorithmic, manner. First, from the noncanonical Hamiltonian formulation for the ideal part of a CHNS system we obtain an appropriate Casimir to serve as the entropy in the metriplectic formalism that describes the dissipation (e.g. viscosity, heat conductivity and diffusion effects). General thermodynamics with the thermodynamic conjugates of concentration and chemical potential are included. Having expressions for the Hamiltonian (energy), entropy, and Poisson bracket, we describe a procedure for obtaining a metriplectic 4-bracket that describes thermodynamically consistent dissipative effects. The 4-bracket formalism leads naturally to a general CHNS system that allows for anisotropic surface energy effects. This general CHNS system reduces to cases in the literature, to which we can compare.</description>

Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by chern classes of tautological bundles. The expression is the result of twisting a well known generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. This gives an explicit description of the rational function the capped vertex is an expansion of. Along the way we prove various limit expressions of the capping operator and the bare vertex function.</description>

Abstract: In this work we derive several important equations in water waves and liquid crystals by deriving them as geodesic equations of right-invariant metrics on two infinite-dimensional groups. The equations we obtain this way are the Hopf (inviscid Burgers) equation, the Camassa-Holm equation, the Hunter-Saxton equation and the Korteweg-De Vries equation. We then study the symmetry groups of the equations themselves and show that one can improve the behaviour of the Hopf equation by metric and topological corrections. The symmetry groups of these equations can aid the benchmarking and testing of numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on outside probabilities for generic non-autonomous Schr\"odinger operators on lattices of arbitrary dimension. Our approach is based on a combination of commutator method originated in scattering theory and novel monotonicity estimate for certain mollified asymptotic observables that track the spacetime localization of evolving states. Sub-ballistic upper bounds are obtained, assuming that momentum vanishes sufficiently fast in the front of the wavepackets. A special case gives a refinement of the general ballistic upper bound of Radin-Simon's, showing that the evolution of wavepackets are effectively confined to a strictly linear light cone with explicitly bounded slope. All results apply to long-range Hamiltonian with polynomial decaying off-diagonal terms and can be extended, via a frozen-coefficient argument, to generic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By bridging geometric and algebraic concepts, this dissertation lays the groundwork for a comprehensive study of the Clifford structures on bundles and spinor fields. We delve into the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle, which encapsulates the essence of Clifford algebras and provides profound insights into the algebraic structures underlying geometric frameworks. The algebraic and classical definitions of spinors within Clifford algebras are concerned, as well as their global realisation as sections of the bundle of spinors constructed within a spin structure on a manifold from the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle background which serves as an effective framework for applications involving spinors such as their classification based on their bilinear covariants and Fierz identities. Homogeneous differential forms playing the role of bilinear covariants can vanish due to algebraic obstructions in a warped flux compactification AdS$_3 \times M_8$ yielding the identification of new spinor field classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.10443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on trees where particles are generated at the root. Particles can only jump away from the root, and they jump from $x$ to $y$ at rate $r_{x,y}$ provided $y$ is empty. Starting from the all empty initial condition, we show that the distribution of the configuration at time $t$ converges to an equilibrium. We study the current and give conditions on the transition rates such that the current is of linear order or such that there is zero current, i.e. the particles block each other. A key step, which is of independent interest, is to bound the first generation at which the particle trajectories of the first $n$ particles decouple.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Schwinger-Dyson Equations for 3d ${\cal N} = 4$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze symmetries corresponding to separated topological sectors of 3d ${\cal} N=4$ gauge theories with Higgs vacua, compactified on a circle. The symmetries are encoded in Schwinger-Dyson identities satisfied by correlation functions of a certain gauge-invariant operator, the "vortex character." Such a character observable is realized as the vortex partition function of the 3d gauge theory, in the presence of a 1/2-BPS line defect. The character enjoys a double refinement, interpreted as a deformation of the usual characters of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. We derive and interpret the Schwinger-Dyson identities for the 3d theory from various physical perspectives: in the 3d gauge theory itself, in a 1d gauged quantum mechanics, in 2d $q$-Toda theory, and in 6d little string theory. We establish the dictionary between all approaches. Lastly, we comment on the transformation properties of the vortex character under the action of three-dimensional Seiberg duality.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Fluid Correspondence in Relativistic Fluids with Spin: From Madelung Form to Gravitational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum-fluid correspondence in a charged relativistic fluid with intrinsic spin. We begin by examining the nonrelativistic case, showing that the inclusion of spin introduces a quantum correction to the classical fluid energy. This correction, coupled with Maxwell's equations, naturally leads to the Schr\"odinger equation in Madelung form. Building on this foundation, we extend the formalism to a relativistic perfect fluid, identifying the system's stress-energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis reveals that the trace of the quantum correction to this tensor corresponds to the energy density of an oscillator, with its frequency determined by the vorticity of the spin motion. We then use the stress-energy-momentum tensor to establish the relationship between the Ricci scalar curvature, as dictated by the Einstein field equations, and the fluid density in a static, spherically symmetric configuration. Lastly, we generalize the Madelung transformation to compressible Navier-Stokes flows with vorticity and viscosity by developing a tailored Clebsch representation of the velocity field. This theoretical framework offers potential applications for studying fluid-like systems with internal rotational degrees of freedom, commonly encountered in astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Mixing times for the TASEP on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mixing times for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a circle of length $N$ with $k$ particles. We show that the mixing time is of order $N^2 \min(k,N-k)^{-1/2}$, and that the cutoff phenomenon does not occur. This confirms behavior which was separately predicted by Jara, Lacoin and Peres, and it is more broadly believed to hold for integrable models in the KPZ-universalty class. Our arguments rely on a connection to periodic last passage percolation with a detailed analysis of flat geodesics, as well as a novel random extension and time shift argument for last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Maxwell Equations for a Flat Interface between Homogeneous Dispersive Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper determines and classifies the spectrum of a non-self-adjoint operator pencil generated by the time-harmonic Maxwell problem with a nonlinear dependence on the frequency for the case of two homogeneous materials joined at a planar interface. We study spatially one-dimensional and two-dimensional reductions in the whole space $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$. The dependence on the spectral parameter, i.e. the frequency, is in the dielectric function and we make no assumptions on its form. These function values determine the spectral sets. In order to allow also for non-conservative media, the dielectric function is allowed to be complex, yielding a non-self-adjoint problem. The whole spectrum consists of eigenvalues and the essential spectrum, but the various standard types of essential spectra do not coincide in all cases. The main tool for determining the essential spectra are Weyl sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of Local Decay Estimates for Schr\"odinger type equations, which is based on the knowledge of Asymptotic Completeness (AC). This approach extends to time dependent potential perturbations, as it does not rely on Resolvent Estimates or related methods. Global in time Strichartz estimates follow for quasi-periodic time-dependent potentials from our results.</description>

      <title>Emergent generalized symmetry and maximal symmetry-topological-order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A characteristic property of a gapless liquid state is its emergent symmetry and dual symmetry, associated with the conservation laws of symmetry charges and symmetry defects respectively. These conservation laws, considered on an equal footing, can't be described simply by the representation theory of a group (or a higher group). They are best described in terms of a topological order (TO) with gappable boundary in one higher dimension; we call this the symTO of the gapless state. The symTO can thus be considered a fingerprint of the gapless state. We propose that a largely complete characterization of a gapless state, up to local-low-energy equivalence, can be obtained in terms of its maximal emergent symTO. In this paper, we review the symmetry/topological-order (Symm/TO) correspondence and propose a precise definition of maximal symTO. We discuss various examples to illustrate these ideas. We find that the 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal symTO described by the 2+1D double-Ising topological order. We provide a derivation of this result using symmetry twists in an exactly solvable model of the Ising critical point. The critical point in the 3-state Potts model has a maximal symTO of double (6,5)-minimal-model topological order. As an example of a noninvertible symmetry in 1+1D, we study the possible gapless states of a Fibonacci anyon chain with emergent double-Fibonacci symTO. We find the Fibonacci-anyon chain without translation symmetry has a critical point with unbroken double-Fibonacci symTO. In fact, such a critical theory has a maximal symTO of double (5,4)-minimal-model topological order. We argue that, in the presence of translation symmetry, the above critical point becomes a stable gapless phase with no symmetric relevant operator.</description>

      <title>Graphical constructions of simple exclusion processes with applications to random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) on a countable set is well defined by the stirring graphical construction as soon as the dynamics of a single particle is. The resulting process is Feller, its Markov generator is derived on local functions, duality at the level of the empirical density field holds. We also provide a general criterion assuring that local functions form a core for the generator. We then move to the simple exclusion process (SEP) and show that the graphical construction leads to a well defined Feller process under a percolation-type assumption corresponding to subcriticality in a percolation with random inhomogeneous parameters. We derive its Markov generator on local functions which, under an additional general assumption, form a core for the generator. We discuss applications of the above results to SSEPs and SEPs in random environments, where the standard assumptions to construct the process and investigate its basic properties (by the analytic approach or by graphical constructions) are typically violated. As detailed in [14], our results for SSEP also allow to extend the quenched hydrodynamic limit in path space obtained in [11] by removing Assumption (SEP) used in there.</description>

      <title>Decoupling by local random unitaries without simultaneous smoothing, and applications to multi-user quantum information tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple telescoping sum trick, together with the triangle inequality and a tensorisation property of expected-contractive coefficients of random channels, allow us to achieve general simultaneous decoupling for multiple users via local actions. Employing both old [Dupuis et al. Commun. Math. Phys. 328:251-284 (2014)] and new methods [Dupuis, arXiv:2105.05342], we obtain bounds on the expected deviation from ideal decoupling either in the one-shot setting in terms of smooth min-entropies, or the finite block length setting in terms of R\'enyi entropies. These bounds are essentially optimal without the need to address the simultaneous smoothing conjecture, which remains unresolved.
  This leads to one-shot, finite block length, and asymptotic achievability results for several tasks in quantum Shannon theory, including local randomness extraction of multiple parties, multi-party assisted entanglement concentration, multi-party quantum state merging, and quantum coding for the quantum multiple access channel. Because of the one-shot nature of our protocols, we obtain achievability results without the need for time-sharing, which at the same time leads to easy proofs of the asymptotic coding theorems. We show that our one-shot decoupling bounds furthermore yield achievable rates (so far only conjectured) for all four tasks in compound settings, that is for only partially known i.i.d. source or channel, which are furthermore optimal for entanglement of assistance and state merging.</description>

      <title>The ${\mathbb S}_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of the moduli space of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the ${\mathbb S}_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of the moduli space of graphs $\mathcal{MG}_{g,n}$. Moreover, we prove that the rational ${\mathbb S}_n$-invariant cohomology of $\mathcal{MG}_{g,n}$ stabilizes for large $n$. That means, if $n \geq g \geq 2$, then there are isomorphisms $H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_n} \rightarrow H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n+1};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_{n+1}}$ for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Limit of geometric quantizations on K\"ahler manifolds with T-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compact K\"ahler manifold $\left( M,\omega ,J\right) $ with $T$-symmetry admits a natural mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ whose real directions come from the $T$-action. In \cite{LW1}, we constructed a one-parameter family of K\"ahler structures $\left( \omega ,J_{t}\right) $'s with the same underlying K\"a hler form $\omega $ and $J_{0}=J$, such that (i) there is a $T$-equivariant biholomorphism between $\left( M,J_{0}\right) $ and $\left( M,J_{t}\right) $ and (ii) K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P} _{t}$'s corresponding to $J_{t}$'s converge to $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ as $t$ goes to infinity.
  In this paper, we study the quantum analog of above results. Assume $L$ is a pre-quantum line bundle on $\left( M,\omega \right) $. Let $\mathcal{H}_{t}$ and $ \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ be quantum spaces defined using polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{t}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ respectively. In particular, $\mathcal{H}_{t}=H_{\bar{\partial}_{t}}^{0}\left( M,L\right) $. They are both representations of $T$. We show that (i) there is a $T$-equivariant isomorphism between $\mathcal{H}_{0}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ and (ii) for regular $T$-weight $\lambda $, corresponding $\lambda $-weight spaces $ \mathcal{H}_{t,\lambda }$'s converge to $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix},\lambda }$ as $t$ goes to infinity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the stationary distribution of asymmetric and weakly asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries. We project the stationary distribution onto a subinterval, whose size is allowed to grow with the length of the underlying segment. Depending on the boundary parameters of the exclusion process, we provide conditions such that the stationary distribution projected onto a subinterval is close in total variation distance to a product measure.</description>

      <title>A Meta Logarithmic-Sobolev Inequality for Phase-Covariant Gaussian Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a meta logarithmic-Sobolev (log-Sobolev) inequality for the Lindbladian of all single-mode phase-covariant Gaussian channels of bosonic quantum systems, and prove that this inequality is saturated by thermal states. We show that our inequality provides a general framework to derive information theoretic results regarding phase-covariant Gaussian channels. Specifically, by using the optimality of thermal states, we explicitly compute the optimal constant $\alpha_p$, for $1\leq p\leq 2$, of the $p$-log-Sobolev inequality associated to the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. Prior to our work, the optimal constant was only determined for $p=1$. Our meta log-Sobolev inequality also enables us to provide an alternative proof for the constrained minimum output entropy conjecture in the single-mode case. Specifically, we show that for any single-mode phase-covariant Gaussian channel $\Phi$, the minimum of the von Neumann entropy $S\big(\Phi(\rho)\big)$ over all single-mode states $\rho$ with a given lower bound on $S(\rho)$, is achieved at a thermal state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a compactness result related to $G$-convergence for autonomous evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. Compared to previous work related to applications, we do not require any boundedness or regularity of the underlying spatial domain; nor do we assume any periodicity or ergodicity assumption on the potentially oscillatory part. In terms of abstract evolutionary equations, we remove any compactness assumptions of the resolvent modulo kernel of the spatial operator. To achieve the results, we introduced a slightly more general class of material laws. As a by-product, we also provide a criterion for $G$-convergence for time-dependent equations solely in terms of static equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confining Dirac fermions in graphene by electrostatic fields is a challenging task. Electric quantum dots created by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip can trap zero-energy quasi-particles. The Lorentzian quantum well provides a faithful, exactly solvable, approximation to such a potential, hosting zero-energy bound states for certain values of the coupling constant. We show that in this critical configuration, the system can be related to the free particle model by means of a supersymmetric transformation. The revealed shape invariance of the model greatly simplifies the calculation of the zero modes and naturally explains the degeneracy of the zero energy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of pseudoclassical isospin is illustrated by the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect proposed by Wu and Yang in 1975. The spatial motion is free however the isospin precesses when the enclosed magnetic flux and the incoming particle's isosopin are not parallel. The non-Abelian phase factor $\mathfrak{F}$ of Wu and Yang acts on the isospin as an S-matrix. The scattering becomes side-independent when the enclosed flux is quantized, ${\Phi}_N=N\Phi_0$ with $N$ an integer. The gauge group $SU(2)$ is an internal symmetry and generates conserved charges only when the flux is quantized, which then splits into two series: for $N=2k$ $SU(2)$ acts trivially but for $N=1+2k$ the implementation is twisted. The orbital and the internal angular momenta are separately conserved. The double rotational symmetry is broken to $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ when $N$ odd. For unquantized flux there are no internal symmetries, the charge is not conserved and protons can be turned into neutrons.</description>

      <title>Reaching Curzon-Ahlborn limit in linear response and Whitney limit in nonlinear response in edge mode quantum thermoelectrics and refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02118</link>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. This is for the first time, we see that in the same setup and using quantum point contacts, the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear response being achieved.</description>

      <title>Complex Stochastic Optimal Control Foundation of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15964v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers when finding optimal controls. This paper explores the application of the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. It provides an in-depth investigation of the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We obtain the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. During the development of the covariant form of the HJB equation, we demonstrate that if the temporal stochastic increments of the two processes are perfectly correlated, then the spatial stochastic increments must be perfectly anti-correlated, and vice versa. The diffusion coefficient we derive has a form that enables the linearization of the HJB equation. The method for linearizing the HJB equation, along with the subsequent derivation of the Dirac equation, was developed in our previous work [V. Yordanov, Scientific Reports 14, 6507 (2024)]. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the application of stochastic optimal control theory to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$ approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming that coordinate functions of the isometric embedding are bounded in $W^{2,1}$ and mean curvature vector of the image surface remains spacelike, we find that the limit falls in two exclusive cases: 1) If the horizon cannot be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up as $\Sigma$ approaches the horizon while the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for $\Sigma$ near the horizon; 2) If the horizon can be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the optimal embedding equation is solvable up to the horizon with the unique solution at the horizon corresponding to isometric embedding into $R^3$ and the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass admits a finite limit at the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>Connection problem for special function solutions of Painlev\'e III equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the small and large $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation. We use the representation of solution in terms of Toeplitz determinants of Bessel functions, which is new. Toeplitz determinants are rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief identity. Finally small and large $x$ asymptotics is obtained using elementary asymptotic methods. The claimed result has not appeared in the literature before. Our formulas are useful for numerical computations of corresponding solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation.</description>

      <title>Hilbert schemes on blowing ups and the free Boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, Chow groups, and Grothendieck groups of coherent sheaves), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar Variational Model for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for neutron stars. We show that the minimizer $\rho_{c}$ of Chandrasekhar energy $E_c(N)$ converges strongly to the minimizer $\rho_{\infty}$ of limit energy $E_{\infty}(N)$ in $L^1\cap L^{\frac{5}{3}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ as the speed of light $c\rightarrow\infty$, this is a limit between two free boundary problems. Moreover, we develop a novel approach to obtain the convergence rates, we show that the above nonrelativistic limit has the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$. For the radius $R_c$ of the compact support of $\rho_c(x)$ and the radius $R_\infty$ of the compact support of $\rho_\infty(x)$, we also get the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$, this means that $R_\infty-R_c=O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ as $c\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we also obtain the optimal uniform bounds of $R_c$ and $L^\infty$-norm of $\rho_c$ with respect to $N$ as $c\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also give an identification of the ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model, which proves that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic. This isomorphism also provides a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles that appear in the latter ring.</description>
