      <title>The pathway to chirality in elemental tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral crystals, like chiral molecules, cannot be superimposed onto their mirror images -- a fundamental property that has been linked to interesting physical behavior and exploited in functional devices. Among the simplest inorganic systems with crystallographic chirality, elemental tellurium adopts structures with right- or left-handed chains. However, understanding the formation mechanisms of those structures has been difficult due to the rapid crystallization of Te, which reaches the spatial and temporal resolution limits of even the most advanced experiments. Here, we report ultra-large-scale, quantum-mechanically accurate simulations that reveal mechanisms of crystallization and the origin of crystallographic chirality in solid Te. We identify a characteristic, disordered cube-like structural motif -- a transient bonding environment with only nanosecond lifetime -- that enables the rapid crystallization of Te and mediates chirality transfer. Based on the resulting microscopic understanding, we are able to explain the switching mechanism of Te-based electrical devices.</description>

      <title>Multiple types of spin textures and robust valley physics in MP$_2$X$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both spin textures and multiple valleys in the momentum space have attracted great attentions due to their versatile applications in spintronics and valleytronics. It is highly desirable to realize multiple types of spin textures in a single material and further couple the spin textures to valley degree of freedom. Here, we study electronic properties of SnP$_{2}$Se$_{6}$ monolayer by first-principles calculations. The monolayer exhibits rare Weyl-type and Ising-type spin textures at different valleys, which can be conveniently expressed by electron and hole dopings, respectively. Besides valley-contrasting spin textures, Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall currents and optical selectivity are found to be valley dependent as well. These valley-related properties also have generalizations to SnP$_{2}$Se$_{6}$ few-layers and other MP$_{2}$X$_{6}$. Our findings open new avenue for exploring appealing interplay between spin textures and multiple valleys, and designing advanced device paradigms based on spin and valley degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may also be interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Surface Patterns Shaped by Additives in Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One technique for creating semiconductor crystals with new, desired properties involves replacing some atoms in the crystal lattice with additives - atoms of a different type. This substitution not only alters the bulk properties of the crystal but also affects the patterns formed on its surface. A surface that is smooth and regular in a uniform crystal can become bunched or meandered under the same growth conditions if some atoms are replaced by additives. The Vicinal Cellular Automaton (VicCA) model is used to study this behavior, analyzing the mechanism of pattern formation when additives are introduced into the system. It has also been shown that the newly formed structures resulting from the presence of additives can be smoothed by applying successive layers of a homogeneous composition on top for a sufficiently long time. Additives can also serve as smoothing agents for bunched or meandered surface patterns formed in a homogeneous crystal. However, this method is less effective for spatially extended patterns such as nanowires. In most cases, the surface structure obtained after applying homogeneous crystal layers to spatial structures is not completely smoothed but instead takes on a different shape. This behavior is demonstrated, and its underlying mechanism is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Nano-size nature of the $\alpha$-FAPbI$_3$ by means of large-scale ab initio simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formamidinium-lead-iodide (FAPbI$_3$) has established itself as the state of the art for high solar-energy conversion efficiency in perovskite-based solar cells. At room temperature, FAPbI$_3$ has a peculiar crystal structure with tetragonal symmetry where the PbI$_6$ framework is distorted from the perfect cubic structure, while the FA molecules are randomly rotated. This is well known experimentally, but the theory is still deficient in describing FAPbI$_3$ with appropriate models in which the system size is adequately taken into account. Using ab initio molecular dynamics at 300 K and first-principle calculations, we prove that, in order to obtain a proper description of the system, three factors must be satisfied simultaneously: the band gap, the minimization of structural distortion, and the zeroing out of the dipole moment. We show that the net dipole moment zeroes out as the system size increases due to PbI6 octahedra distortions rather than FA rotations. We also show that the band gap oscillations in temperature are correlated to octahedra tilting. The optimum between simulations and experimental properties indicates that FAPbI$_3$ is properly described by a system size approaching the nano-scale.</description>

      <title>Magnetoacoustic waves in a highly magnetostrictive FeGa thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between surface acoustic waves and magnetization offers an efficient route for electrically controlling magnetic states. Here, we demonstrate the excitation of magnetoacoustic waves in galfenol, a highly magnetostrictive alloy made of iron (72%) and gallium (28%). We quantify the amplitude of the induced magnetization oscillations using magnetic imaging in an X-ray photoelectron microscope and estimate the dynamic magnetoelastic constants through micromagnetic simulations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of galfenol for magnonic applications and reveal that, despite strong magnetoelastic coupling, magnetic interactions and spin-wave dispersion relations significantly influence the overall amplitude of magnetoacoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient path-integral molecular dynamics simulations with GPUMD using neuroevolution potentials: Case studies on thermal properties of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations are crucial for accurately capturing nuclear quantum effects in materials. However, their computational intensity and reliance on multiple software packages often limit their applicability at large scales. Here, we present an integration of PIMD methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), into the open-source GPUMD package, combined with highly accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models. This approach achieves almost the accuracy of first-principles calculations with the computational efficiency of empirical potentials, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that incorporate nuclear quantum effects. We demonstrate the efficacy of the combined NEP-PIMD approach by examining various thermal properties of diverse materials, including lithium hydride (LiH), three porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and elemental aluminum. For LiH, our NEP-PIMD simulations successfully capture the isotope effect, reproducing the experimentally observed dependence of the lattice parameter on the reduced mass. For MOFs, our results reveal that achieving good agreement with experimental data requires consideration of both nuclear quantum effects and dispersive interactions. For aluminum, the TRPMD method effectively captures thermal expansion and phonon properties, aligning well with quantum mechanical predictions. This efficient NEP-PIMD approach opens new avenues for exploring complex material properties influenced by nuclear quantum effects, with potential applications across a broad range of materials.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of molten salts: insights from molecular dynamics simulations and fundamental bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to calculate thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity in two common molten salts, LiF and KCl. Our analysis includes the total thermal conductivity and intrinsic conductivity involving mass currents measured experimentally. The latter shows good agreement with the experimental data. We also calculate their key thermodynamic properties such as constant-pressure and constant-volume specific heats. We subsequently compare the results to the lower bound for thermal diffusivity expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. Using this comparison and recent theoretical insights into thermodynamic and transport properties in liquids, we interpret thermal properties on the basis of atomistic dynamics and phonon excitations. We finally find that thermal diffusivity of molten salts is close to their kinematic viscosity.</description>

      <title>Factors influencing quantum evaporation of helium from polar semiconductors from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there is much indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM), to date it has evaded detection. Current efforts focus on DM masses over $\sim$GeV -- to push the sensitivity of DM searches to lower masses, new DM targets and detection schemes are needed. In this work, we focus on the latter - a novel detection scheme recently proposed to detect ~10-100 meV phonons in polar target materials. Previous work showed that well-motivated models of DM can interact with polar semiconductors to produce an athermal population of phonons. This new sensing scheme proposes that these phonons then facilitate quantum evaporation of $^3$He from a van der Waals film deposited on the target material. However, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still unclear, with several uncertainties related to the precise rate of evaporation and how it can be controlled. In this work, we use \textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compare the adsorption energies of helium atoms on a polar target material, sodium iodide (NaI), to understand the underlying evaporation physics. We explore the role of surface termination, monolayer coverage and elemental species on the rate of He evaporation from the target material. Using this, we discuss the optimal target features for He-evaporation experiments and their range of tunability through chemical and physical modifications such as applied field and surface termination.</description>

      <title>Theory of Field-Angle-Resolved Magnetoacoustic Resonance in Spin-Triplet Systems for Application to Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent studies of acoustically driven electron spin resonance applied to diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, we investigate the interaction of an electronic spin-triplet state with periodically time-dependent oscillating strain fields. On the basis of a lowest-lying two-level system, we show the importance of two-phonon transition probabilities controlled by rotating an applied magnetic field using the Floquet theory. In particular, we demonstrate how to evaluate coupling-strength parameters in the spin--strain interaction for the $C_{3v}$ point group considering the NV spin states. The level splitting of spin states can be adjusted by changing the field directions relative to the NV axis to obtain lower phonon resonance frequencies suitable for practical applications. Focusing on a field-rotation angle for the vanishment of a longitudinal phonon-mediated transition, we show that the magnetoacoustic resonance presented here provides useful information as a new probe of unquantified spin--strain couplings possessed by NV defects.</description>

      <title>Theory of Spin-Acoustic Resonance for Spin-3/2 Si Vacancy with $C_{3v}$ Site Symmetry in Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent acoustically driven spin resonance studies applied to silicon vacancy centers in silicon carbide, we theoretically investigate the spin--strain interaction characterized by the defect spin-$3/2$ quadrupole components coupled to strain fields. Considering the $C_{3v}$ symmetry of the vacancy site beyond the spherical approximation, we clarify the effect of a deviation from the spherical symmetry on spin resonance transition rate, which can be changed by rotating a static magnetic field. The ratios of spin--strain coupling parameters can be evaluated from the anisotropic field-direction dependence of the transition rate using a standing or traveling surface acoustic wave. We also discuss the effect of the propagation direction of the acoustic wave tilted from the crystallographic mirror plane reflecting the $C_{3v}$ symmetry. The results presented here reveal the quadrupole properties inherent in spin-3/2 states and will promote the realization of the acoustically driven strain control of spin.</description>

Abstract: In transition-metal compounds, the transition-metal d electrons play an important role in their physical properties; however, the effects of the electron correlation between the ligand p electrons have not been clear yet. In this Letter, the Ru 4d and O 2p partial density of states (PDOS) in transition-metal oxide SrRuO$_3$ involving Weyl fermions are investigated by resonant photoemission spectroscopy. The observations demonstrate that the O 2p PDOS is distorted from that predicted by first-principles calculations than the Ru 4d PDOS. The results indicate that the electron correlation in the ligand orbitals will be important to understand the electronic structure of the p-d hybridized state in strongly correlated electron systems, even with topological states.</description>

      <title>Large spontaneous Hall effect with flexible domain control in an antiferromagnetic material TaMnP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets without parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry offer novel perspectives in the field of functional magnetic materials. Among them, those with ferromagnetic-like responses are promising candidates for future applications such as antiferromagnetic (AF) memory; however, examples showing large effects are extremely limited. In this study, we show that the orthorhombic system TaMnP exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) $\sim360-370$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ in spite of the small net magnetization $\sim10^{-2}$ $\mu_B$/Mn. Our neutron scattering experiment and the observation of the AH effect indicated that a magnetic structure of TaMnP was dominated by an AF component represented by $B_{3g}$ with the propagation vector $q=0$. Furthermore, we confirmed that the obtained AHC is among the largest observed in AF materials at zero fields. Additionally, our first-principles calculations revealed that the spin-orbit interaction originating in the nonmagnetic Ta-$5d$ electrons significantly contributes to enhancing Berry curvatures in the momentum space. We found that the magnetic fields along all the crystal axes triggered the AF domain switching, indicating the possibility of controlling the AF domain using the small net magnetization, which is symmetrically different.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity Derived from an $f$-Electron Collinear Antiferromagnetic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Appropriate symmetry breaking generates an anomalous Hall (AH) effect, even in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. Itinerant magnets with $d$ electrons are typical examples that show a significant response. By contrast, the process by which a response emerges from $f$-electron AFM structures remains unclear. In this study, we show that an AFM material, Ce$_2$CuGe$_6$, yields a large AH conductivity (AHC) of $550$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which exceeds the values previously reported in $d$-electron AFM materials. Observed features, including the scaling relation against electrical conductivity, suggest that this AH transport is induced cooperatively by both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms derived from the AFM structure.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, topological crystalline insulator and the absence of valence-skipping in AgSnSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent suggestion of valence-skipping phenomenon driving a two-gap superconductivity in $Ag$-doped SnSe, by Kataria, \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. B 107, 174517 (2023)], has brought to the fore a long-standing issue once again. The absence of crystallographically inequivalent Sn cites corroborated by electronic properties of AgSnSe$_2$, calculated using first-principles density functional theory, however, does not appear to provide a strong support in favor of valence-skipping in this system. Interestingly, the signature of avoided band-crossings (with the inclusion of SOC) and non-zero \textit{mirror} Chern number ($n_{\mathcal{M}}$) confirm a non-trivial topology. The presence of mirror symmetry-protected surface states along the mirror planes indicates that AgSnSe$_2$ could be a potential candidate for topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Moreover, our calculation of electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic superconducting properties of AgSnSe$_2$, using Migdal-Eliashberg theory, gives a single-gap superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c \approx 7$K, consistent with the experimental value of $5$K. The interplay of topology and superconductivity in this three-dimensional material appears quite intriguing and it may provide new insights into the exploration of superconductivity and topology.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Electronic Ground State of La3Ni2O7-{\delta} Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a superconductivity signature in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} under a pressure of 14 GPa, with a superconducting transition temperature of around 80 K, has attracted considerable attention. An important aspect of investigating electronic structures is discerning the extent to which the electronic ground state of La3Ni2O7-{\delta} resembles the parent state of the cuprate superconductor, a charge transfer insulator with long-range antiferromagnetism. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have uncovered the crucial influence of oxygen ligands on the electronic ground states of the Ni ions, displaying a charge transfer nature akin to cuprate but with distinct orbital configurations. Both in-plane and out-of-plane Zhang-Rice singlets associated with Ni d_(x^2-y^2 ) and d_(z^2) orbitals are identified, together with a strong interlayer coupling through inner apical oxygen. Additionally, in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} films, we have detected a superlattice reflection (1/4, 1/4, L) at the Ni L absorption edge using resonant X-ray scattering measurements. Further examination of the resonance profile indicates that the reflection originates from the Ni d orbitals. By evaluating the reflection's azimuthal angle dependence, we have confirmed the presence of collinear antiferromagnetic spin ordering and charge-like anisotropy ordered with the same periodicity. Notably, our findings reveal a microscopic relationship between these two components in the temperature dependence of the scattering intensity of the reflection. This investigation enriches our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Spin freezing induced giant exchange bias in a doped Hund's metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange bias (EB) is a fundamental phenomenon in widespread information technologies. However, a comprehensive understanding of its microscopic origin remains a great challenge. One key issue in the debate is the role of frustration and disorder in the EB mechanism, which motivates the exploration of the EB effect in spin glass (SG) systems. Here,in the SG state of Cr-doped Hund's metal CsFe2As2, we discover a giant EB effect with a maximum bias field of ~ 2 Tesla, which is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of traditional alloy SGs. Our results indicate that the giant EB effect should originate from the exchange interactions at the natural boundaries between the tunable ferromagnetic-like (FM) regions around Cr dopants and the SG matrix, via which the FM spins are strongly pinned by the frozen spins in the SG matrix. In addition, the temperature-dependent and cooling-field-dependent EB behaviors could be interpreted well by the SG model with frustrated FM/SG boundaries, which provides an intuitive and explicit understanding of the impact of glassy parameters on the EB effect. All these results suggest that the correlated metals are promising directions for exploring the EB effect in the SG state.</description>

      <title>Long wavelength interdomain phonons and instability of dislocations in small-angle twisted bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for long wavelength phonons originating at dislocations separating domains in small-angle twisted homobilayers of 2D materials such as graphene and MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se). We find that both partial and perfect dislocations, forming due to lattice relaxation in the twisted bilayers with parallel and anti-parallel alignment of unit cells of the constituent layers, respectively, support several one-dimensional subbands of the {\it interdomain} phonons. We show that spectrum of the lowest gapless subband is characterized by imaginary frequencies, for wave-numbers below a critical value, dependent on the dislocation orientation, which indicates an instability for long enough straight partial and perfect dislocations. The other subbands are gapped, with subband bottoms lying below the frequency of interlayer shear mode in domains, which facilitates their detection with the help of optical and magnetotransport techniques.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Materials with Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this account, we will give an overview of our research progress on novel quantum properties in topological quantum materials with kagome lattice. Here, there are mainly two categories of kagome materials: magnetic kagome materials and nonmagnetic ones. On one hand, magnetic kagome materials mainly focus on the 3d transition-metal-based kagome systems, including Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, YMn6Sn6, FeSn, and CoSn. The interplay between magnetism and topological bands manifests vital influence on the electronic response. For example, the existence of massive Dirac or Weyl fermions near the Fermi level signicantly enhances the magnitude of Berry curvature in momentum space, leading to a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. In addition, the peculiar frustrated structure of kagome materials enables them to host a topologically protected skyrmion lattice or noncoplaner spin texture, yielding a topological Hall effect that arises from the realspace Berry phase. On the other hand, nonmagnetic kagome materials in the absence of longrange magnetic order include CsV3Sb5 with the coexistence of superconductivity, charge density wave state, and band topology and van der Waals semiconductor Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$. For these two kagome materials, the tunability of electric response in terms of high pressure or carrier doping helps to reveal the interplay between electronic correlation effects and band topology and discover the novel emergent quantum phenomena in kagome materials.</description>

      <title>High harmonic spectroscopy reveals anisotropy of the Mott to Charge-Density-Wave phase transition in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the use of polarization-resolved high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy to investigate the quantum phases and transitions in the correlated charge density wave (CDW) phase of TiSe$_2$. Unlike previous studies focusing on crystallographic changes, the research examines the reordering that occurs within the CDW phase as the material is cooled from room temperature to 14 K. By linking ultrafast field-driven dynamics to the material's potential landscape, the study demonstrates how HHG is sensitive to quantum phase transitions. The findings reveal an anisotropic component below the CDW transition temperature, providing new insights into the nature of this phase. The investigation highlights the interplay between linear and nonlinear optical responses and their departure from simple perturbative dynamics, offering a fresh perspective on correlated quantum phases in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field assisted exciton diffusion in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exciton energy spectrum and their propagation in moir\'e superlattices formed in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers. In such structures, as a result of weak interlayer interaction, an effective, moir\'e, potential acting on excitons arises. Usually, excitons are considered to be localized in such potential. Here we demonstrate that the coupling of optically active excitons with induced electromagnetic field produces linear in the wavevector energy dispersion even if the quantum mechanical tunneling between the localization sites is suppressed. The effect can be described as a result of the processes of virtual generation-recombination of excitons at the localization sites that results in the $ r^{-3}$ dependence of the transfer matrix element on the intersite distance $r$. Based on the calculated energy spectrum we study exciton propagation in moir\'e superlattices with allowance for the light-exciton interaction. We consider semiclassical diffusion of excitons and take into account exciton-phonon and exciton-static defect scattering. For these mechanisms the diffusion coefficient decreases with increase of the temperature. We also analyze the hopping propagation regime and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the exciton diffusion coefficient is described by the power-law rather than by an exponential function of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced quasi-long-range $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge density wave and competing orders in the kagome metal FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic ordering is prevalent in correlated systems, which commonly exhibit competing interactions. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to show that the charge density wave transition temperature of FeGe increases with pressure and evolves towards a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodic lattice modulation, $\mathbf{q}$$^*$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$. In the pressure interval between 4$&lt;$$p$$&lt;$12 GPa both orders coexist and the spatial extent of the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order at high pressure becomes nearly long-range, $\sim$30 unit cells, while the correlation length of the 2$\times$2 phase remains shorter-ranged. The $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ phase is the ground state above 15 GPa, consistent with harmonic DFT calculations that predict a dimerization induced $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order without phonon softening. The pressure dependence of the integrated intensities of $\mathbf{q}$$_\mathrm{CDW}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\mathbf{q}$$^*$ indicates a competition between the 2$\times$2 and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ and demonstrates that the ground state of FeGe is characterized by a rich landscape of metastable/fragile phases. We discuss possible scenarios based on an order-disorder transformation and the formation of Friedel oscillations.</description>

      <title>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>

      <title>Charting new regions of Cobalt's chemical space with maximally large magnetic anisotropy: A computational high-throughput study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy slows down magnetic relaxation and plays a prominent role in the design of permanent magnets. Coordination compounds of Co(II) in particular exhibit large magnetic anisotropy in the presence of low-coordination environments and have been used as single-molecule magnet prototypes. However, only a limited sampling of Cobalt's vast chemical space has been performed, potentially obscuring alternative chemical routes toward large magnetic anisotropy. Here we perform a computational high-throughput exploration of Co(II)'s chemical space in search of new single-molecule magnets. We automatically assemble a diverse set of about 15000 novel complexes of Co(II) and fully characterize them with multi-reference ab initio methods. More than 100 compounds exhibit magnetic anisotropy comparable to or larger than leading known compounds. The analysis of these results shows that compounds with record-breaking magnetic anisotropy can also be achieved with coordination four or higher, going beyond the established paradigm of two-coordinated linear complexes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nucleation and growth of Zr oxide precipitates of internally oxidized Nb3Sn superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on atomic-scale analyses of nucleation and growth of Zr oxide precipitates and the microstructural evolution of internally oxidized Nb3Sn wires for high-field superconducting magnet applications, utilizing atom probe tomography (APT), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and first-principles calculations. APT analyses reveal that prior to interfacial reactions at Nb/Nb3Sn interfaces, Zr atoms in an unreacted Nb-1Zr-4Ta (at.%) alloy form clusters with O atoms owing to their high affinity for oxygen and are segregated at grain boundaries (GBs) in the Nb grains. Then, nucleation of Zr oxide precipitates occurs in Nb3Sn and at Nb3Sn/Nb interfaces, driven by the small solubility of Zr and O in Nb3Sn compared to Nb. Quantitative APT and TEM analyses of Zr oxide precipitates in Nb3Sn layers demonstrate the nucleation, growth, and coarsening processes of Zr oxide precipitates in Nb3Sn layers. A high number density of Zr oxide nanoprecipitates is observed in the Nb3Sn layers, ~10^23 per m^3, with a mean precipitate diam. &lt;10 nm at 625 oC and 700 oC, which provide pinning centers for grain refinement of Nb3Sn, &lt;100 nm diam., and serve as pinning sites for fluxons. First-principles calculations and classical nucleation theory are employed to describe the nucleation of Zr oxide precipitates in Nb3Sn: energy barriers and the critical radius for nucleation of Zr oxide precipitates in Nb3Sn. Our research yields the kinetic pathways for nucleation and growth of Zr oxide precipitates and the microstructural evolution of Nb3Sn layers, which helps to improve the fabrication process of internally oxidized Nb3Sn wires for high-field superconducting magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of transient negative capacitance has sparked an intense debate on the role of homogeneous and inhomogeneous mechanisms in polarizations switching. In this work, we report observation of transient negative capacitance in improper ferroelectric h-YbFeO3 films in a resistor-capacitor circuit, and a concaved shape of anomaly in the voltage wave form, in the early and late stage of the polarizations switching respectively. Using a phenomenological model, we show that the early-stage negative capacitance is likely due to the inhomogeneous switching involving nucleation and domain wall motion, while the anomaly at the late stage, which appears to be a reminiscent negative capacitance is the manifestation of the thermodynamically unstable part of the free-energy landscape in the homogeneous switching. The complex free-energy landscape in hexagonal ferrites may be the key to cause the abrupt change in polarization switching speed and the corresponding anomaly. These results reconcile the two seemingly conflicting mechanisms in the polarization switching and highlight their different roles at different stages. The unique energy-landscape in hexagonal ferrites that reveals the dual switching mechanism suggests the promising application potential in terms of negative capacitance.</description>

      <title>Electronic Properties of Ultra-Wide Bandgap B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N Computed from First-Principles Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) materials such as AlN and BN hold great promise for future power electronics due to their exceptional properties. They exhibit large bandgaps, high breakdown fields, high thermal conductivity, and high mechanical strengths. AlN and BN have been extensively researched, however, their alloys, B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N, are much less studied despite their ability to offer tunable properties by adjusting $x$. In this article, we predict the electronic properties of 17 recently predicted ground states of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N in the $x=0-1$ range using first-principles density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory within $GW$ approximation. All the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures are found to be UWBG materials and have bandgaps that vary linearly from that of wurtzite-phase ($w$) AlN (6.19 eV) to that of $w$-BN (7.47 eV). The bandstructures of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N show that a direct-to-indirect bandgap crossover occurs near $x = 0.25$. Furthermore, we find that B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys have much larger dielectric constants than the constituent bulk materials (AlN=$9.3~\varepsilon_0$ or BN=$7.3~\varepsilon_0$), with values reaching as high as $12.1~\varepsilon_0$. These alloys are found to exhibit large dielectric breakdown fields in the range 9--35 MV/cm with a linear dependence on $x$. This work provides the much needed advancement in the understanding of the properties of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N to aid their application in next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>AI-guided inverse design and discovery of recyclable vitrimeric polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03690v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vitrimer is a new, exciting class of sustainable polymers with the ability to heal due to their dynamic covalent adaptive network that can go through associative rearrangement reactions. However, a limited choice of constituent molecules restricts their property space, prohibiting full realization of their potential applications. To overcome this challenge, we couple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) machine learning model for inverse design of vitrimer chemistries with desired glass transition temperature (Tg) and synthesize a novel vitrimer polymer. We build the first vitrimer dataset of one million chemistries and calculate Tg on 8,424 of them by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed novel VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of multi-component vitrimers. By constructing a continuous latent space containing necessary information of vitrimers, we demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of our framework in discovering novel vitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the training regime. To validate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments, we generate novel vitrimer chemistries with a target Tg = 323 K. By incorporating chemical intuition, we synthesize a vitrimer with Tg of 311-317 K, and experimentally demonstrate healability and flowability. The proposed framework offers an exciting tool for polymer chemists to design and synthesize novel, sustainable vitrimer polymers for a facet of applications.</description>

      <title>Scanning tunneling microscopy using CO-terminated probes with tilted and straight geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy using a CO-functionalized tip is combined with simulations to explore the impact of the CO tilt angle on topographies of a single Cu atom and CO molecule adsorbed on Cu(111). Images of the Cu atom acquired with varying tip tilt angles and sample voltages are reproduced by the calculations. The agreement between measured and simulated data allows to unveil the tip-orbital composition of the tunneling current, which highlights the role of the different p-orbitals of the CO tip. Microscope data of adsorbed CO and their dependence on voltage and probe-surface distance are captured for the nontilted junction geometry and in the limit of weak tip-surface interaction assuming sufficiently large tip-sample separations.</description>

      <title>Driving noncollinear interlayer exchange coupling intrinsically in magnetic trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic side layers sandwiching a nonmagnetic spacer as a metallic trilayer has become a pivotal platform for achieving spintronic devices. Recent experiments demonstrate that manipulating the width or the nature of conducting spacer induces noncollinear magnetic alignment between the side layers. Our theoretical analysis reveals that altering the width of spacer significantly affects the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC), resulting in noncollinear alignment. Through analytic and first-principles methods, our study on the Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer shows that at a specific width of the Ag spacer, the magnetic moments of side layers tend to be perpendicular. This alignment is mediated by Ag quantum well states, exhibiting spin spirals across the trilayer. Our results reveal that the noncollinear IEC offers a degree of freedom to control magnetic devices and boot spintronic technology with improved transport capabilities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermal conductance at interfaces between gold and amorphous silicon and amorphous silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer at the interface between two materials is becoming increasingly important as the size of electronic devices shrinks. Most studies concentrate on the interfacial thermal conductance between either crystalline-crystalline or amorphous-amorphous materials. Here, we investigate the interfacial thermal conductance at crystalline-amorphous interfaces using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, gold and two different materials, silicon and silica, in both their crystalline and amorphous structures, have been considered. The findings reveal that the interfacial thermal conductance between amorphous structures and gold is significantly higher as compared to crystalline structures for both planar and rough interfaces ($\approx$ 152 MW/(m$^2$K) for gold-amorphous silicon and $\approx$ 56 MW/(m$^2$K) for gold-crystalline silicon). We explain this increase by two factors~:~the relative commensurability between amorphous silicon/silica and gold leads to enhanced bonding and cross-correlations of atomic displacements at the interface, contributing to enhance phonon elastic transmission. Inelastic phonon transmission is also enhanced due to the relative larger degree of anharmonicity characterizing gold-amorphous silicon/silica. We also show that all the vibrational modes that participate to interfacial heat transfer are delocalized and use the Ioffe-Regel (IR) criterion to separate the contributions of propagating~(propagons) and non-propagating modes~(diffusons). In particular, we demonstrate that, while at gold-amorphous silicon interfaces elastic phonon scattering involves propagons and inelastic phonon scattering involves a mixture of propagons and diffusons, in gold-amorphous silica, all modes transmitting energy at the interface are diffusons.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum magnets are a versatile materials platform for studying the emergent many-body physics and collective excitations that can arise even in systems with only short-range interactions. Understanding their low-temperature structure and spin Hamiltonian is key to explaining their magnetic properties, including unconventional quantum phases, phase transitions, and excited states. We study the metal-organic coordination compound (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and its deuterated counterpart, which upon its discovery was identified as a candidate two-leg quantum ($S = 1/2$) spin ladder in the strong-leg coupling regime. By growing large single crystals and probing them with both bulk and microscopic techniques, we deduce that two previously unknown structural phase transitions take place between 136 K and 113 K. The low-temperature structure has a monoclinic unit cell giving rise to two inequivalent spin ladders. We further confirm the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 30 mK and discuss the implications of this two-ladder structure for the magnetic properties of (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$.</description>

      <title>On the average spin Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the average spin Chern number (ASCN) as an indicator of the topological significance of the spin degree of freedom within insulating materials. Whenever this number is a non-zero even integer, it distinguishes the material as a spin Chern insulator, and the number is a topological invariant whenever there is a symmetry that commutes with the spin and protects Chern numbers. If this number is not zero, it indicates that the material has non-trivial spin transport properties, and it lies close to the value of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) within the bandgap. For systems where the spin commutes with the Hamiltonian, the ASCN matches the SHC. When the non-commutativity of the spin with the Hamiltonian cannot be neglected, both values are non-zero simultaneously. The ASCN is therefore a good complement for the intrinsic contribution of the SHC, and permits to detect topological information of the material which is not possible alone from the value of the SHC.</description>

      <title>Determination of the N\'eel vector in rutile altermagnets through x-ray magnetic circular dichroism: the case of MnF$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical simulation of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the $L_{2,3}$ edge of Mn in altermagnetic MnF$_2$ using a combination of density functional + exact diagonlization of an atomic model. We explore how the dichroic spectra vary with the light propagation vector and the N\'eel vector. We show how XMCD in rutile structures can be employed to determine the orientation of the N\'eel vector. An exact relationship between the XMCD spectra for different orientation of the N\'eel vector valid in the absence on the valence spin-orbit coupling and core-valence multipole interaction is derived and its approximate validity demonstrated by numerical calculation for the full Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of the magnetite(001)/water interface from molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetite/water interface is commonly found in nature and plays a crucial role in various technological applications. However, our understanding of its structural and dynamical properties at the molecular scale remains still limited. In this study, we develop an efficient Behler-Parrinello neural network potential (NNP) for the magnetite/water system, paying particular attention to the accurate generation of reference data with density functional theory. Using this NNP, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the magnetite (001) surface across a wide range of water coverages, from the single molecule to bulk water. Our simulations revealed several new ground states of low coverage water on the Subsurface Cation Vacancy (SCV) model and yielded a density profile of water at the surface that exhibits marked layering. By calculating mean square displacements, we obtained quantitative information on the diffusion of water molecules on the SCV for different coverages, revealing significant anisotropy. Additionally, our simulations provided qualitative insights into the dissociation mechanisms of water molecules at the surface.</description>
