      <title>Minimizing Vertical Length in Linked Bar Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linked bar chart is the augmentation of a traditional bar chart where each bar is partitioned into blocks and pairs of blocks are linked using orthogonal lines that pass over intermediate bars. The order of the blocks readily influences the legibility of the links. We study the algorithmic problem of minimizing the vertical length of these links, for a fixed bar order. The main challenge lies with ``dependent'' links, whose vertical link length cannot be optimized independently per bar. We show that, if the dependent links form a forest, the problem can be solved in $O(nm)$ time, for n bars and m links. If the dependent links between non-adjacent bars form a forest, the problem admits an $O(n^4m)$-time algorithm. Finally, we show that the general case is fixed-parameter tractable in the maximum number of links that are connected to one bar.</description>

      <title>Edge-ANN: Storage-Efficient Edge-Based Remote Sensing Feature Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting real-time constraints for high-performance Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search remains a critical challenge in remote sensing edge devices, which are essentially fusion systems like micro-satellites and UAVs, largely due to stringent limitations in primary (RAM) and secondary (disk) storage. To address this challenge, we propose Edge-ANN, an innovative ANN framework specifically engineered for storage efficiency. The core innovation of Edge-ANN lies in its departure from traditional tree-based methods that store high-dimensional hyperplanes. Instead, it leverages pairs of existing data items, termed "anchors," to implicitly define spatial partitions. To ensure these partitions are both balanced and effective, we have developed a novel Binary Anchor Optimization algorithm.This architectural shift eliminates the dimension-dependence of the space complexity. Rigorous experiments on three multi-source datasets, MillionAID, High-resolution Urban Complex Dataset, and GlobalUrbanNet Dataset, demonstrate that under simulated edge environments with dual storage constraints, Edge-ANN achieves a 30-40% reduction in secondary storage compared to the baseline, at the cost of a minor 3-5% drop in retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, its overall retrieval performance surpasses that of other mainstream methods in these constrained scenarios. Collectively, these results establish Edge-ANN as a state-of-the-art solution for enabling large-scale, high-performance, real-time remote sensing feature retrieval on edge devices with exceptionally constrained storage. The codes of Edge-ANN are available at https://github.com/huaijiao666/Edge-ANN.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms and Implementations for Extracting Maximum-Size $(k,\ell)$-Sparse Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multigraph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, \ell)$-sparse if every subset $X \subseteq V$ induces at most $\max\{k|X| - \ell, 0\}$ edges. Finding a maximum-size $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph is a classical problem in rigidity theory and combinatorial optimization, with known polynomial-time algorithms. This paper presents a highly efficient and flexible implementation of an augmenting path method, enhanced with a range of powerful practical heuristics that significantly reduce running time while preserving optimality. These heuristics $\unicode{x2013}$ including edge-ordering, node-ordering, two-phase strategies, and pseudoforest-based initialization $\unicode{x2013}$ steer the algorithm toward accepting more edges early in the execution and avoiding costly augmentations. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates that our implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude. We also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for extracting an inclusion-wise maximal $(k,2k)$-sparse subgraph with the sparsity condition required only for node sets of size at least three, which is particularly relevant to 3D rigidity when $k = 3$. We provide a carefully engineered implementation, which is publicly available online and is proposed for inclusion in the LEMON graph library.</description>

      <title>Feature-aware manifold meshing and remeshing of point clouds and polyhedral surfaces with guaranteed smallest edge length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point clouds and polygonal meshes are widely used when modeling real-world scenarios. Here, point clouds arise, for instance, from acquisition processes applied in various surroundings, such as reverse engineering, rapid prototyping, or cultural preservation. Based on these raw data, polygonal meshes are created to, for example, run various simulations. For such applications, the utilized meshes must be of high quality. This paper presents an algorithm to derive triangle meshes from unstructured point clouds. The occurring edges have a close to uniform length and their lengths are bounded from below. Theoretical results guarantee the output to be manifold, provided suitable input and parameter choices. Further, the paper presents several experiments establishing that the algorithms can compete with widely used competitors in terms of quality of the output and timing and the output is stable under moderate levels of noise. Additionally, we expand the algorithm to detect and respect features on point clouds as well as to remesh polyhedral surfaces, possibly with features.
