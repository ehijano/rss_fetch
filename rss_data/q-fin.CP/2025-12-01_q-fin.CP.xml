      <title>Black-Litterman and ESG Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple portfolio optimization strategy using ESG data with the Black-Litterman allocation framework. ESG scores are used as a bias for Stein shrinkage estimation of equilibrium risk premiums used in assigning Black-Litterman asset weights. Assets are modeled as multivariate affine normal-inverse Gaussian variables using CVaR as a risk measure. This strategy, though very simple, when employed with a soft turnover constraint is exceptionally successful. Portfolios are reallocated daily over a 4.7 year period, each with a different set of hyperparameters used for optimization. The most successful strategies have returns of approximately 40-45% annually.</description>

      <title>Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prices: Evidence from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines factors that influence prices of most common five cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero over 2010-2018 using weekly data. The study employs ARDL technique and documents several findings. First, cryptomarket-related factors such as market beta, trading volume, and volatility appear to be significant determinant for all five cryptocurrencies both in short- and long-run. Second, attractiveness of cryptocurrencies also matters in terms of their price determination, but only in long-run. This indicates that formation (recognition) of the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies are subjected to time factor. In other words, it travels slowly within the market. Third, SP500 index seems to have weak positive long-run impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litcoin, while its sign turns to negative losing significance in short-run, except Bitcoin that generates an estimate of -0.20 at 10% significance level. Lastly, error-correction models for Bitcoin, Etherem, Dash, Litcoin, and Monero show that cointegrated series cannot drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a speed of 23.68%, 12.76%, 10.20%, 22.91%, and 14.27% respectively.</description>
