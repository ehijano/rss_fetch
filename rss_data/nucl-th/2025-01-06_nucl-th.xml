      <title>Interplay of shell evolution and configuration mixing in the single-hole-like states of $^{99-131}$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale shell-model calculations are performed for the $9/2^+_{\rm g.s.}$, $1/2^-_1$, $3/2^-_1$, and $5/2^-_1$ states in the odd-$A$ indium isotopes with $N=50-82$. The calculated energy levels, electromagnetic moments, and spectroscopic factors exhibit remarkable agreement with the experimental data due to significant configuration mixing for the neutron numbers away from the closed shells. While the $1/2^-_1$ energy levels well follow those of the effective single-particle energies that are formulated for fractional occupancies of the neutron orbitals, the configuration mixing with the proton $p_{3/2}$ and $f_{5/2}$ orbitals plays a crucial role in locating the $1/2^-_1$ levels at the right position in the actual shell-model calculations.</description>

      <title>Forward dijet and vector meson production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first describe the predictions concerning jet production in the very forward region, especially in the FOCAL kinematic region of the ALICE collaboration at CERN as a test of saturation. We also compare vector meson production cross sections at the LHC in Pb Pb and p Pb collisions with the Balitsky Fadin Kuraev Lipatov and the Balitsky Kovchegov evolution equations and data favor the observation of saturation at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark suppression and anisotropic flow at intermediate momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an intermediate-momentum regime where mass effects are significant, heavy quark suppression and anisotropic flow are computed to investigate the transition between the collisional and radiative energy loss. Based on the collision kernel for diffusion, elastic scattering and semi-collinear gluon-bremsstrahlung can be consistently incorporated into a Boltzmann equation that involves the heavy quark diffusion coefficient. Using the running coupling constant and the diffusion coefficient constrained by lattice QCD data, the collisional and radiative energy-loss contributions to the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ are studied in hydrodynamically expanding thermal media. The evolution of the observables, the bulk flow effect, and the dependence on mass and centrality are discussed in noncentral heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>On the pole trajectory of the subthreshold negative parity nucleon with varying pion masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pole trajectory of the recently established subthreshold negative parity nucleon, namely the $N^*(920)$, with varying pion masses, in the scheme of linear $\sigma$ model with nucleons. We find that the pole moves from the complex plane to the real axis rather straightfowardly, on the second Riemann sheet. We also re-examined the $\sigma$ pole trajectory and find it in good agreement with Roy equation analysis result.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I make a brief review about the QCD phases and the equation of state inferred from the neutron star data. Along the temperature axis at low baryon density, the QCD phase transition is a smooth crossover, and it is a natural extension of our imagination to postulate a similar crossover along the density axis at low temperature. Even without phase transitions, the inferred thermodynamic properties of neutron star matter turn out to be highly nontrivial already at twice of the nuclear saturation density. I also give some discussions about the substantiation of quark matter by means of the gravitational wave signals including the multi-messenger prospect.</description>

      <title>Describing the speed of sound peak of isospin-asymmetric cold strongly interacting matter using effective models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-monotonic behavior of the speed of sound for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter, found by recent lattice QCD simulations, can be reproduced within the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and Linear Sigma Model with quarks when the couplings become isospin chemical potential-dependent. The introduction of medium-dependent couplings can potentially affect the equivalence between the thermodynamic relations and their definitions from statistical mechanics. We describe the procedure to compensate for the introduction of medium-dependent couplings to preserve the correct thermodynamic identities. We find the isospin chemical potential dependence for the couplings from the isospin density LQCD data and, after finding the compensating function to correctly describe the pressure, we show that the description of the square of the speed of sound reported by LQCD is well reproduced when using the found medium-dependent couplings in both models.</description>

      <title>Systematics of the low-energy electric dipole strength in the Sn isotopic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the mass dependence of the low-energy electric dipole strength (LEDS) in Sn isotopes in the range $ A = 111 - 124$ based on data obtained with the Oslo method and with relativistic Coulomb excitation in forward-angle ($p,p^\prime$) scattering. The combined data cover an energy range of $2 - 20$ MeV which permits, with minimal assumptions, a decomposition of the total strength into the contribution from the low-energy tail of the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR) and possible resonance-like structures on top of it. In all cases, a resonance peaked at about 8.3 MeV is observed, exhausting an approximately constant fraction of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule with a local maximum at $^{120}$Sn which might be related to shell structure effects. For heavier isotopes ($A \geq 118$) a consistent description of the data requires the inclusion of a second resonance centered at 6.5 MeV, representing the isovector response of the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR). Its strength corresponds to a small fraction of the total LEDS only and shows an approximately linear dependence on mass number. The experimental results are also compared to ab initio-based microscopic calculations to investigate the importance of an inclusion of quasiparticle vibration coupling (qPVC) for a realistic description of the LEDS. A possible interpretation of the experimentally observed two-bump structure is given.</description>

      <title>A Potential Model Study of the Nucleon's Charge and Mass Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the charge and mass distributions within a nucleon and compute the associated squared radii based on a potential model approach. Different constituent quark configurations such as $\Delta$, $Y$, and quark-diquark are considered and compared, with model parameters calibrated by experimental measurements of the proton and neutron charge radius. The results suggest that while the charge radius is dictated by quark dynamics, the mass radius is strongly influenced by nonperturbative QCD contributions to a nucleon's mass that are not sensitive to the constituent quarks. As a result, the mass radius could become substantially different from the charge radius. The obtained nucleon mass distributions of different configurations are further used for simulations of the initial conditions in heavy ion collisions. The computed eccentricities $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ are found to demonstrate a considerable sensitivity to the input nucleon profiles, especially to the mass radius in the peripheral region as well as for systems with fewer participants.</description>

      <title>A possible evidence of pion condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that once a large number of pion is condensed in a high-energy hadron collision, the gamma-ray spectrum from $\pi^0$ decay takes on a typical broken power-law shape, which has been documented in many astronomical observations, but we have not yet recognized it. We show that this pion condensation is caused by a large number of soft gluons condensed in protons.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</description>
