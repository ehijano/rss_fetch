      <title>Learning Generalized Diffusions using an Energetic Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting governing physical laws from computational or experimental data is crucial across various fields such as fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Many of those physical laws are dissipative due to fluid viscosity or plasma collisions. For such a dissipative physical system, we propose two distinct methods to learn the corresponding laws of the systems based on their energy-dissipation laws, assuming either continuous data (probability density) or discrete data (particles) are available. Our methods offer several key advantages, including their robustness to corrupted observations, their easy extension to more complex physical systems, and the potential to address higher-dimensional systems. We validate our approach through representative numerical examples and carefully investigate the impacts of data quantity and data property on the model discovery.</description>

      <title>Cost optimized ab initio tensor network state methods: industrial perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce efficient solutions to optimize the cost of tree-like tensor network state method calculations when an expensive GPU-accelerated hardware is utilized. By supporting a main powerful compute node with additional auxiliary, but much cheaper nodes to store intermediate, precontracted tensor network scratch data, the IO time can be hidden behind the computation almost entirely without increasing memory peak. Our solution is based on the different bandwidths of the different communication channels, like NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand and available storage media, which are utilized on different layers of the algorithm. This simple heterogeneous multiNode solution via asynchronous IO operation has the potential to minimize IO overhead, resulting in maximum performance rate for the main compute unit. In addition, we introduce an in-house developed massively parallel protocol to serialize and deserialize block sparse matrices and tensors, reducing data communication time tremendously. Performance profiles are presented for the spin adapted ab initio density matrix renormalization group method for corresponding U(1) bond dimension values up to 15400 on the active compounds of the FeMoco with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)].</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Complex Networks with AI-Driven Adaptive Nodes for Optimized Connectivity and Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High connectivity and robustness are critical requirements in distributed networks, as they ensure resilience, efficient communication, and adaptability in dynamic environments. Additionally, optimizing energy consumption is also paramount for ensuring sustainability of networks composed of energy-constrained devices and prolonging their operational lifespan. In this study, we introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced self-organizing network model, where each adaptive node autonomously adjusts its transmission power to optimize network connectivity and redundancy while lowering energy consumption. Building on our previous Hamiltonian-based methodology, which is designed to lead networks toward globally optimized states of complete connectivity and minimal energy usage, this research integrates a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based decision-making model at each node. By leveraging a dataset from the Hamiltonian approach, each node independently learns and adapts its transmission power in response to local conditions, resulting in emergent global behaviors marked by high connectivity and resilience against structural disruptions. This distributed, MLP-driven adaptability allows nodes to make context-aware power adjustments autonomously, enabling the network to maintain its optimized state over time. Simulation results show that the proposed AI-driven adaptive nodes collectively achieve stable complete connectivity, significant robustness, and optimized energy usage under various conditions, including static and mobile network scenarios. This work contributes to the growing field of self-organizing networks by illustrating the potential of AI to enhance complex network design, supporting the development of scalable, resilient, and energy-efficient distributed systems across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>

      <title>Machine learning approach for mapping the stable orbits around planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical N-body simulations are commonly used to explore stability regions around exoplanets, offering insights into the possible existence of satellites and ring systems. This study aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) techniques to generate predictive maps of stable regions surrounding a hypothetical planet. The approach can also be extended to planet-satellite systems, planetary ring systems, and other similar configurations. A dataset was generated using 10^5 numerical simulations, each incorporating nine orbital features for the planet and a test particle in a star-planet-test particle system. The simulations were classified as stable or unstable based on stability criteria, requiring particles to remain stable over a timespan equivalent to 10,000 orbital periods of the planet. Various ML algorithms were tested and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to determine the most effective predictive model. Tree-based algorithms showed comparable accuracy in performance. The best-performing model, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 98.48%, with 94% recall and precision for stable particles and 99% for unstable particles. ML algorithms significantly reduce the computational time required for three-body simulations, operating approximately 100,000 times faster than traditional numerical methods. Predictive models can generate entire stability maps in less than a second, compared to the days required by numerical simulations. The results from the trained ML models will be made accessible through a public web interface, enabling broader scientific applications.</description>

      <title>A fast spectral sum-of-Gaussians method for electrostatic summation in quasi-2D systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-2D electrostatic systems, characterized by periodicity in two dimensions with a free third dimension, have garnered significant interest in many fields. We apply the sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) approximation to the Laplace kernel, dividing the interactions into near-field, mid-range, and long-range components. The near-field component, singular but compactly supported in a local domain, is directly calculated. The mid-range component is managed using a procedure similar to nonuniform fast Fourier transforms in three dimensions. The long-range component, which includes Gaussians of large variance, is treated with polynomial interpolation/anterpolation in the free dimension and Fourier spectral solver in the other two dimensions on proxy points. Unlike the fast Ewald summation, which requires extensive zero padding in the case of high aspect ratios, the separability of Gaussians allows us to handle such case without any zero padding in the free direction. Furthermore, while NUFFTs typically rely on certain upsampling in each dimension, and the truncated kernel method introduces an additional factor of upsampling due to kernel oscillation, our scheme eliminates the need for upsampling in any direction due to the smoothness of Gaussians, significantly reducing computational cost for large-scale problems. Finally, whereas all periodic fast multipole methods require dividing the periodic tiling into a smooth far part and a near part containing its nearest neighboring cells, our scheme operates directly on the fundamental cell, resulting in better performance with simpler implementation. We provide a rigorous error analysis showing that upsampling is not required in NUFFT-like steps, achieving $O(N\log N)$ complexity with a small prefactor. The performance of the scheme is demonstrated via extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning application for stellar parameters determination: III- Denoising Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this third paper in a series, we investigate the need of spectra denoising for the derivation of stellar parameters. We have used two distinct datasets for this work. The first one contains spectra in the range of 4450-5400 {\AA} at a resolution of 42000 and the second in the range of 8400-8800 {\AA} at a resolution of 11500. We constructed two denoising techniques, an autoencoder, and a Principal Component Analysis. Using random Gaussian noise added to synthetic spectra, we have trained a Neural Network to derive the stellar parameters Teff, log g, ve sin i, {\xi}t, and [M/H] of the denoised spectra. We find that, independently of the denoising technique, the stellar parameters accuracy values do not improve once we denoise the synthetic spectra. This is true with and without applying data augmentation to the stellar parameters Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Fluid-structure coupled simulation framework for lightweight explosion containment structures under large deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight, single-use explosion containment structures provide an effective solution for neutralizing rogue explosives, combining affordability with ease of transport. This paper introduces a three-stage simulation framework that captures the distinct physical processes and time scales involved in detonation, shock propagation, and large, plastic structural deformations. The hypothesis is that as the structure becomes lighter and more flexible, its dynamic interaction with the gaseous explosion products becomes increasingly significant. Unlike previous studies that rely on empirical models to approximate pressure loads, this framework employs a partitioned procedure to couple a finite volume compressible fluid dynamics solver with a finite element structural dynamics solver. The level set and embedded boundary methods are utilized to track the fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interfaces. The interfacial mass, momentum, and energy fluxes are computed by locally constructing and solving one-dimensional bi-material Riemann problems. A case study is presented involving a thin-walled steel chamber subjected to an internal explosion of $250~\text{g}$ TNT. The result shows a $30\%$ increase in the chamber volume due to plastic deformation, with its strains remaining below the fracture limit. Although the incident shock pulse carries the highest pressure, the subsequent pulses from wave reflections also contribute significantly to structural deformation. The high energy and compressibility of the explosion products lead to highly nonlinear fluid dynamics, with shock speeds varying across both space and time. Comparisons with simpler simulation methods reveal that decoupling the fluid and structural dynamics overestimates the plastic strain by $43.75\%$, while modeling the fluid dynamics as a transient pressure load fitted to the first shock pulse underestimates the plastic strain by $31.25\%$.</description>

      <title>Zephyr quantum-assisted hierarchical Calo4pQVAE for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the approach of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era set to begin particle collisions by the end of this decade, it is evident that the computational demands of traditional collision simulation methods are becoming increasingly unsustainable. Existing approaches, which rely heavily on first-principles Monte Carlo simulations for modeling event showers in calorimeters, are projected to require millions of CPU-years annually -- far exceeding current computational capacities. This bottleneck presents an exciting opportunity for advancements in computational physics by integrating deep generative models with quantum simulations. We propose a quantum-assisted hierarchical deep generative surrogate founded on a variational autoencoder (VAE) in combination with an energy conditioned restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) embedded in the model's latent space as a prior. By mapping the topology of D-Wave's Zephyr quantum annealer (QA) into the nodes and couplings of a 4-partite RBM, we leverage quantum simulation to accelerate our shower generation times significantly. To evaluate our framework, we use Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge 2022. Through the integration of classical computation and quantum simulation, this hybrid framework paves way for utilizing large-scale quantum simulations as priors in deep generative models.</description>

      <title>A simple model for longitudinal electron transport during and after laser excitation: Emergence of electron resistive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous attentions over several decades, as it provides a much faster way to control electron dynamics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so how and why an electron can acquire a longitudinal velocity remains unanswered. Here we show that it is the magnetic field that steers the electron to the light propagation direction. But, quantitatively, our free-electron model is still unable to reproduce the experimental velocities. Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the system absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the experimental observation. We introduce a concept of the resistive transport, where electrons deaccelerate under a constant resistance after laser excitation. This theory finally explains why the experimental distance-versus-time forms a down-concave curve, and unifies ballistic and superdiffusive transports into a single resistive transport. We expect that our finding will motivate further investigations.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability and Topological Charge Fragmentation in Antiskyrmions of Rhombohedral Barium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiskyrmions, as topological quasi-particles, hold significant promise for spintronics and nanoscale data storage applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the thermal stability of antiskyrmion nanodomains in rhombohedral barium titanate. At 1 K, antiskyrmions with a topological charge of -2 emerge as the most stable nanodomain state across all examined diameters. In our systematic study, the most robust antiskyrmion was found to have a diameter of 4 nm, maintaining its original size, shape, and topological charge up to the characteristic temperature T* ~ 85 K. Domains with diameters between 2.8 and approximately 4.5 nm exhibit fragmentation into six topological defects, termed quarks, each carrying a fractional skyrmion charge of -1/3. For domains larger than 4.5 nm, each topological quark splits into two pre-quarks, each with a charge of -1/6. These larger nanodomains demonstrate increased mobility and a growing tendency for shape and skyrmion charge fluctuations. Above the T* temperature, all larger nanodomains gradually shrink to a diameter of about 4 nm before collapsing into a single-domain state. These findings reveal the relatively high stability of antiskyrmions over a broad temperature range, even in the absence of a stabilizing bias field, and emphasize the pivotal role of topological quark dynamics. This establishes barium titanate as a key platform for exploring and applying topological phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$ as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, machine learning, and finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it using historical streamflow measurements. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model: a gain in median NSE from 0.56 to 0.64 (time-split experiment) and from 0.30 to 0.34 (basin-split experiment). Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

      <title>Energy-based, geometric, and compositional formulation of fluid and plasma models</title>

Abstract: Fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Considering the example of (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, an ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of a Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is reused as a subsystem of an (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics model. The energy-based, compositional approach simplifies understanding complex models, and it makes it easy to encapsulate, reuse, and replace (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>

      <title>Predicting Thermal Stress and Failure Risk in Monoblock Divertors Using 2D Finite Difference Modelling and Gradient Boosting Regression for Fusion Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a combined approach using a 2D finite difference method and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) to analyze thermal stress and identify potential failure points in monoblock divertors made of tungsten, copper, and CuCrZr alloy. The model simulates temperature and heat flux distributions under typical fusion reactor conditions, highlighting regions of high thermal gradients and stress accumulation. These stress concentrations, particularly at the interfaces between materials, are key areas for potential failure, such as thermal fatigue and microcracking. Using the GBR model, a predictive maintenance framework is developed to assess failure risk based on thermal stress data, allowing for early intervention. This approach provides insights into the thermomechanical behavior of divertors, contributing to the design and maintenance of more resilient fusion reactor components.</description>

      <title>How polarization fields can be beneficial in nitride emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can actually enhance the overlap of electron and hole wave functions in III-nitride quantum wells, which are being considered for polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications. By systematically exploring the design space of AlInGaN heterostructures with machine learning, we uncover that larger electric fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emitters. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to reveal unexpected trends for informing the design of semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.</description>
