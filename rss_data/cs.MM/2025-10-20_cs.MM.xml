      <title>Game mechanics for cyber-harm awareness in the metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educating children and young people to be safe online is essential, especially as the metaverse, a next-generation internet blending immersive technologies, promises to reshape their interactions and amplify their experiences. While virtual reality offers fully immersive, highly interactive, and multi-sensory engagement, it also heightens cyber harm risks for young or vulnerable users. To address this, the CyberNinjas VR experience was developed to educate children aged 8 to 16 on safe metaverse behaviours, providing clear referral steps for harmful interactions. Understanding user engagement in metaverse gaming will aid the design of future VR environments which prioritize safety and inclusivity. This project analyses CyberNinjas to understand how game mechanics can foster cyber-safe behaviours.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%), video object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple object tracking (44.94%). We will release our code.</description>

      <title>MCA: Modality Composition Awareness for Robust Composed Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</description>

      <title>SANR: Scene-Aware Neural Representation for Light Field Image Compression with Rate-Distortion Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light field images capture multi-view scene information and play a crucial role in 3D scene reconstruction. However, their high-dimensional nature results in enormous data volumes, posing a significant challenge for efficient compression in practical storage and transmission scenarios. Although neural representation-based methods have shown promise in light field image compression, most approaches rely on direct coordinate-to-pixel mapping through implicit neural representation (INR), often neglecting the explicit modeling of scene structure. Moreover, they typically lack end-to-end rate-distortion optimization, limiting their compression efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose SANR, a Scene-Aware Neural Representation framework for light field image compression with end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. For scene awareness, SANR introduces a hierarchical scene modeling block that leverages multi-scale latent codes to capture intrinsic scene structures, thereby reducing the information gap between INR input coordinates and the target light field image. From a compression perspective, SANR is the first to incorporate entropy-constrained quantization-aware training (QAT) into neural representation-based light field image compression, enabling end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that SANR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding rate-distortion performance with a 65.62\% BD-rate saving against HEVC.</description>

      <title>Sound Clouds: Exploring ambient intelligence in public spaces to elicit deep human experience of awe, wonder, and beauty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the ambient intelligence (AmI) systems we encounter in our daily lives, including security monitoring and energy-saving systems, typically serve pragmatic purposes, we wonder how we can design and implement ambient artificial intelligence experiences in public spaces that elicit deep human feelings of awe, wonder, and beauty. As a manifestation, we introduce Sound Clouds, an immersive art installation that generates live music based on participants' interaction with several human-height spheres. Our installation serves as a provocation into future ambient intelligence that provokes, not limits, the future possibilities of AmI.</description>

      <title>BandCondiNet: Parallel Transformers-based Conditional Popular Music Generation with Multi-View Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional music generation offers significant advantages in terms of user convenience and control, presenting great potential in AI-generated content research. However, building conditional generative systems for multitrack popular songs presents three primary challenges: insufficient fidelity of input conditions, poor structural modeling, and inadequate inter-track harmony learning in generative models. To address these issues, we propose BandCondiNet, a conditional model based on parallel Transformers, designed to process the multiple music sequences and generate high-quality multitrack samples. Specifically, we propose multi-view features across time and instruments as high-fidelity conditions. Moreover, we propose two specialized modules for BandCondiNet: Structure Enhanced Attention (SEA) to strengthen the musical structure, and Cross-Track Transformer (CTT) to enhance inter-track harmony. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations on two popular music datasets with different sequence lengths. Objective results on the shorter dataset show that BandCondiNet outperforms other conditional models in 9 out of 10 metrics related to fidelity and inference speed, with the exception of Chord Accuracy. On the longer dataset, BandCondiNet surpasses all conditional models across all 10 metrics. Subjective evaluations across four criteria reveal that BandCondiNet trained on the shorter dataset performs best in Richness and performs comparably to state-of-the-art models in the other three criteria, while significantly outperforming them across all criteria when trained on the longer dataset. To further expand the application scope of BandCondiNet, future work should focus on developing an advanced conditional model capable of adapting to more user-friendly input conditions and supporting flexible instrumentation.</description>
