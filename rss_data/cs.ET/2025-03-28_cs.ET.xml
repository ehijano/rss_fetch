      <title>All-Optical High-speed Programmable Nonlinear Activation Functions using a Fabry-Perot Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The threads of photonics are eagerly awaited to redefine the future of neuromorphic data processing, especially as the computing-intensive artificial intelligence models become an unavoidable part of our everyday lives. Still, there is much to be improved within the domain of photonic nonlinear activation functions, as the programmable, all-optical, energy-efficient nonlinearities remain beyond the grasp of today's state of the art. In this paper, we address the issue at hand and propose a novel approach in the realization of high-performing all-optical photonic activations. Through simulations and experiments, we show that Fabry-Perot laser diodes (FP-LDs) exhibit richness and high programmability of their nonlinear response to input optical pulses with widths as low as 25 ps. We demonstrate a variety of sigmoid-like and inverted PReLU-like trends to be used as all-optical activation functions in photonic neural networks, testing their performance in stringent, real-life training scenarios with randomized data patterns at repetition rates up to 10 GHz. The programmability of activations is shown using a multitude of experimental operating parameters, among which we highlight the power variation of an additional continuous wave laser, injected into the FP-LD, enriching our approach with all-optical control of all-optical activations. With very low static power consumption of our active element, we achieve a record-breaking energy draw on the order of pJ to hundreds of fJ per nonlinear operation.</description>

      <title>Standalone FPGA-Based QAOA Emulator for Weighted-MaxCut on Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing QC emulation is crucial for advancing QC applications, especially given the scalability constraints of current devices. FPGA-based designs offer an efficient and scalable alternative to traditional large-scale platforms, but most are tightly integrated with high-performance systems, limiting their use in mobile and edge environments. This study introduces a compact, standalone FPGA-based QC emulator designed for embedded systems, leveraging the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve the Weighted-MaxCut problem. By restructuring QAOA operations for hardware compatibility, the proposed design reduces time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N), where N equals 2^n for n qubits. This reduction, coupled with a pipeline architecture, significantly minimizes resource consumption, enabling support for up to nine qubits on mid-tier FPGAs, roughly three times more than comparable designs. Additionally, the emulator achieved energy savings ranging from 1.53 times for two-qubit configurations to up to 852 times for nine-qubit configurations, compared to software-based QAOA on embedded processors. These results highlight the practical scalability and resource efficiency of the proposed design, providing a robust foundation for QC emulation in resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents that operate autonomously benefit from lifelong learning capabilities. However, compatible training algorithms must comply with the decentralized nature of these systems, which imposes constraints on both the parameter counts and the computational resources. The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is one of these. FF relies only on feedforward operations, the same used for inference, for optimizing layer-wise objectives. This purely forward approach eliminates the need for transpose operations required in traditional backpropagation. Despite its potential, FF has failed to reach state-of-the-art performance on most standard benchmark tasks, in part due to unreliable negative data generation methods for unsupervised learning.
  In this work, we propose the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) algorithm, a competitive training method aimed at closing this performance gap. Inspired by standard self-supervised contrastive learning for vision tasks, SCFF generates positive and negative inputs applicable across various datasets. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing unsupervised local learning algorithms on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet. We extend FF's application to training recurrent neural networks, expanding its utility to sequential data tasks. These findings pave the way for high-accuracy, real-time learning on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>
