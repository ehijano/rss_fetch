      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Classification of Brain Tumors Using DNA Microarray Gene Expression Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02033</link>

Abstract: DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called "Deep VQC" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Reinforcement Learning for Controlling Biological Networks: The GATTACA Framework</title>

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Sloppy approach to QSP: XAI enabling fit-for-purpose models</title>

Abstract: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing its full potential depends on effectively managing the complexity of the underlying mathematical models and biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow grounded in the principles of sloppy modeling, offering a practical and principled strategy for building and deploying models in a QSP pipeline. Our approach begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be as comprehensive and unbiased as possible by drawing from the collective knowledge of prior research. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), which simplifies models while preserving their predictive capacity and mechanistic interpretability. Applying MBAM as a context-specific model reduction strategy, we link the simplified representation directly to the downstream predictions of interest. The resulting reduced models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of this workflow through case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection. Our analysis suggests several promising next steps for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies in HIV infected patients within the context of a general-purpose QSP modeling workflow.</description>

      <title>Efficiency-fluctuation trade-offs in biomolecular assembly processes</title>

Abstract: Stochastic fluctuations of molecular abundances are a ubiquitous feature of cellular processes and lead to significant cell-to-cell variability. Recent theoretical work established lower bounds for stochastic fluctuations in cells for broad classes of cellular processes by analyzing the dynamics of reaction motifs that are embedded within a larger network with arbitrary interactions and dynamics. For example, a class of generalized assembly processes in which two co-regulated subunits irreversibly form a complex was shown to exhibit an unavoidable trade-off between assembly efficiency and subunit fluctuations: Regardless of rate constants and details of feedback control, subunit fluctuations were shown to diverge as the assembly efficiency approaches 100%. In contrast, other work has reported how efficient assembly processes work as stochastic noise filters or can achieve robust adaptation through integral control. While all of these results are technically correct their seemingly contradictory conclusions raise the question of how broadly applicable the previously reported efficiency-fluctuation trade-off is. Here, we show that a much broader class of assembly processes than previously considered is subject to an efficiency-fluctuation trade-off which diverges in the high efficiency regime. We find the proposed noise filtering property of efficient assembly processes corresponds to a singular limit of this class of systems. Additionally, we show that combining feedback control with distinct subunit synthesis rates is a necessary condition to overcome the generalized efficiency-fluctuation trade-off. Through numerical examples, we show that biomolecular integral controllers are one of several realizations of such control. How small a change to joint subunit control is sufficient to avoid diverging fluctuations in the high-efficiency limit remains an open question.</description>
