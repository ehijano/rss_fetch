      <title>On the Expressiveness of State Space Models via Temporal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of state space models (SSM), which have recently emerged as a potential alternative to transformer architectures in large language models. Building on recent work, we analyse SSM expressiveness through fragments and extensions of linear temporal logic over finite traces. Our results show that the expressive capabilities of SSM vary substantially depending on the underlying gating mechanism. We further distinguish between SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic (quantised models), whose expressive power remains within regular languages, and SSM with unbounded precision, which can capture counting properties and non-regular languages. In addition, we provide a systematic comparison between these different SSM variants and known results on transformers, thereby clarifying how the two architectures relate in terms of expressive power.</description>

      <title>A Bisimulation-Invariance-Based Approach to the Separation of Polynomial Complexity Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility to separate the bisimulation-invariant fragment of P from that of NP, resp. PSPACE. We build on Otto's Theorem stating that the bisimulation-invariant queries in P are exactly those that are definable in the polyadic mu-calculus, and use a known construction from model checking in order to reduce definability in the polyadic $\mu$-calculus to definability in the ordinary modal mu-calculus within the class of so-called power graphs, giving rise to a notion of relative regularity. We give examples of certain bisimulation-invariant queries in NP, resp. PSPACE, and characterise their membership in P in terms of relative non-regularity of particular families of tree languages. A proof of non-regularity for all members of one such family would separate the corresponding class from P, but the combinatorial complexity involved in it is high. On the plus side, the step into the bisimulation-invariant world alleviates the order-problem that other approaches in descriptive complexity suffer from when studying the relationship between P and classes above.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Constraint Automata for Description Logics with Concrete Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decidability or complexity issues about the consistency problem for description logics with concrete domains have already been analysed with tableaux-based or type elimination methods. Concrete domains in ontologies are essential to consider concrete objects and predefined relations. In this work, we expose an automata-based approach leading to the optimal upper bound EXPTIME, that is designed by enriching the transitions with symbolic constraints. We show that the nonemptiness problem for such automata belongs to EXPTIME if the concrete domains satisfy a few simple properties. Then, we provide a reduction from the consistency problem for ontologies, yielding EXPTIME-membership.Thanks to the expressivity of constraint automata, the results are extended to additional ingredients such as inverse roles, functional role names and constraint assertions, while maintaining EXPTIME-membership, which illustrates the robustness of the approach</description>

      <title>For Generalised Algebraic Theories, Two Sorts Are Enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised algebraic theories (GATs) allow multiple sorts indexed over each other. For example, the theories of categories or Martin-L{\"o}f type theories form GATs. Categories have two sorts, objects and morphisms, and the latter are double-indexed over the former. Martin-L{\"o}f type theory has four sorts: contexts, substitutions, types and terms. For example, types are indexed over contexts, and terms are indexed over both contexts and types. In this paper we show that any GAT can be reduced to a GAT with only two sorts, and there is a section-retraction correspondence (formally, a strict coreflection) between models of the original and the reduced GAT. In particular, any model of the original GAT can be turned into a model of the reduced (two-sorted) GAT and back, and this roundtrip is the identity.
  The reduced GAT is simpler than the original GAT in the following aspects: it does not have sort equalities; it does not have interleaved sorts and operations; if the original GAT did not have interleaved sorts and operations, then the reduced GAT won't have operations interleaved between different sorts. In a type-theoretic metatheory, the initial algebra of a GAT is called a quotient inductive-inductive type (QIIT). Our reduction provides a way to implement QIITs with sort equalities or interleaved constructors which are not allowed by Cubical Agda. An instance of our reduction is the well-known method of reducing mutual inductive types to a single indexed family. Our approach is semantic in that it does not rely on a syntactic description of GATs, but instead, on Uemura's bi-initial characterisation of the category of (finite) GATs in the 2-category of finitely complete categories with a chosen exponentiable morphism.</description>

      <title>The complexity of downward closures of indexed languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indexed languages are a classical notion in formal language theory, which has attracted attention in recent decades due to its role in higher-order model checking: They are precisely the languages accepted by order-2 pushdown automata. The downward closure of an indexed language -- the set of all (scattered) subwords of its members -- is well-known to be a regular over-approximation. It was shown by Zetzsche (ICALP 2015) that the downward closure of a given indexed language is effectively computable. However, the algorithm comes with no complexity bounds, and it has remained open whether a primitive-recursive construction exists. We settle this question and provide a triply (resp.\ quadruply) exponential construction of a non-deterministic (resp.\ deterministic) automaton. We also prove (asymptotically) matching lower bounds. For the upper bounds, we rely on recent advances in semigroup theory, which let us compute bounded-size summaries of words with respect to a finite semigroup. By replacing stacks with their summaries, we are able to transform an indexed grammar into a context-free one with the same downward closure, and then apply existing bounds for context-free grammars.</description>

      <title>Polynomial definability in constraint languages with few subpowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first-order formula is called primitive positive (pp) if it only admits the use of existential quantifiers and conjunction. Pp-formulas are a central concept in (fixed-template) constraint satisfaction since CSP($\Gamma$) can be viewed as the problem of deciding the primitive positive theory of $\Gamma$, and pp-definability captures gadget reductions between CSPs.
  An important class of tractable constraint languages $\Gamma$ is characterized by having few subpowers, that is, the number of $n$-ary relations pp-definable from $\Gamma$ is bounded by $2^{p(n)}$ for some polynomial $p(n)$. In this paper we study a restriction of this property, stating that every pp-definable relation is definable by a pp-formula of polynomial length. We conjecture that the existence of such short definitions is actually equivalent to $\Gamma$ having few subpowers, and verify this conjecture for a large subclass that, in particular, includes all constraint languages on three-element domains. We furthermore discuss how our conjecture imposes an upper complexity bound of co-NP on the subpower membership problem of algebras with few subpowers.</description>

      <title>Specifying and Verifying RDMA Synchronisation (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows a machine to directly read from and write to the memory of remote machine, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data transfer. Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\text{RDMA}^\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\text{RDMA}^{\text{TSO}}_{\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\text{RDMA}^{\text{SC}}_{\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures. Our libraries are built to be compatible with an existing set of high-performance libraries called LOCO, which ensures compositionality and verifiability.</description>
