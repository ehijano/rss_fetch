      <title>The Three Hundred Project hydrodynamical simulations: Hydrodynamical Weak-Lensing Cluster Mass Biases and Richnesses using different hydro models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters derived from weak-lensing observations is sensitive to projection effects, and, on average, it is biased low with respect to the true cluster mass, with a mass and redshift dependence. In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters carried out with GadgetX and GIZMO-SIMBA as part of the Three Hundred Project. We use them to quantify weak-lensing mass biases with respect also to the results from dark matter-only simulations. We also investigate how the biases of the weak-lensing mass estimates propagate into the richness-mass relation. Future wide-field weak-lensing surveys require per cent accuracy on the characterisation of cluster masses in order to use galaxy cluster number count and clustering as complementary probes for cosmological analyses. We aim to shed light on the effect of the presence of baryons on the weak-lensing mass bias and also whether this bias depends on the galaxy formation recipe; in addition, we seek to model the richness-mass relation that can be used as guidelines for observational experiments for cluster cosmology. We produce weak-lensing simulations of random projections to model the expected excess surface mass density profile of clusters up to redshift $z=1$. We derive the weak-lensing mass-richness relation and find consistency within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties across hydrodynamical simulations. The scatter in observed richness at a fixed weak-lensing mass, or vice versa, increases linearly with redshift at a fixed stellar mass cut. Importantly, we observe that the scatter in richness at a given true mass is smaller than at a given weak-lensing mass. Our results align well with SDSS redMaPPer cluster observations.

      <title>Uncovering the bias in the evidence for dynamical dark energy through minimal and generalized modeling approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we argue that the CPL parameterisation for the dark energy equation of state is biased towards preferring such model over the constant $w$ while the latter bounds are still compatible with LCDM. For that we compare constraints on the EoS parameters $w_0$ and early time type $w_a$ (CPL) against those with a late time parameterisation on $w_a$ (LZ) and the constant $w$ model, using CMB, Supernovae and BAO from DESI datasets. We found, the same as was the case with CPL model, preference for dynamical dark energy within the LZ model, but for values almost symmetrically distributed with respect to their LCDM limits. This is due to the fact that the presence of $w_0$ allows to recast each parametrisation into making it compensate the preference for $w\sim -1$ in the opposite direction. To further test our hypothesis, we fixed $w_0$ to -1 and followed a minimal approach by considering models that deviates by one free parameter, or we extend to more general models that either group both late and early effects, or allow the presence of two dark energy fluid alike and constant alike component. We found that all the variants, except the original CPL are still compatible with LCDM, with likelihoods peaking close to $w_0 = -1$, $w_a = 0$, or 0.68 for $\Omega_{\rm CC}$, with the constant $w$ and the late time $w_a$ having the smallest constraints. Although we found that the evidence from CPL is stronger than those for the more minimal cases, however the preference increases further for the more generalized parameterizations, while still staying compatible with LCDM in terms of the significance levels. We conclude that considering CPL model is not sufficient to test deviation from the standard model and that it is necessary to conduct further minimal or more general approaches to better understand the outcomes from model testing and inference methods.(abridged)</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of Spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry Breaking (SLSB) on Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The SLSB is induced by a time-like Bumblebee vector field which is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background. The power spectrum and GW amplitude are computed to investigate how Lorentz violation leaves observable imprints. Our analysis contrasts the Lorentz-violating Bumblebee cosmology with standard cosmology in the context of primordial GW generation. We calculate the GW strain amplitude over frequencies $(10^{-10}~\mathrm{Hz}, 10^4~\mathrm{Hz})$, for a range of the dimensionless Lorentz-violating parameter, $ -10^{-3} \leq l \leq 10^{-4} $, which essentially comes from a slight sensitivity to the equation of state for dark energy. For positive $l$ values, the amplitude of GW shows a mild suppression compared to the standard cosmological scenario ($ l = 0 $). This effect could be observable with detectors like SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO. Conversely, negative $ l $ values amplify the GW amplitude, enhancing detectability by both SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO, as well as by THEIA and DECIGO. Notably, the GW strain amplitude increases by an order of magnitude as $ l $ moves from $0$ to $ -10^{-3} $, improving prospects for detection in high-sensitivity detectors like THEIA and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Matter creation, adiabaticity and phantom behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel cosmological framework that unifies matter creation dynamics with thermodynamic principles. Starting with a single-component fluid characterized by a constant equation of state parameter, $\omega$, we introduce a generalized second law of thermodynamics by considering the entropy associated with the cosmic horizon. Imposing an adiabatic expansion condition uniquely determines the particle creation rate, $\Gamma$, a feature unprecedented in previous matter creation models. This mechanism yields a cosmology featuring phantom-like expansion while relying solely on a single constituent, which can be either a quintessence-like fluid or a non-exotic, non-relativistic dark matter component. Remarkably, this framework avoids the need for exotic physics while providing a consistent explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Our results open new pathways for understanding the interplay between horizon thermodynamics, particle creation, and cosmic evolution, offering fresh insights into the nature of dark energy and its potential thermodynamic origins.</description>

      <title>ALPs production from Light Primordial Black Holes: the role of Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light Primordial Black Holes (LPBHs) with masses in the range $10$ g $\leq M_{\rm BH} \leq 10^9$ g, although they evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can play a significant role in the production of both Dark Matter and Dark Radiation. In particular, LPBHs can evaporate into light axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses $m_a \lesssim$ MeV, contributing to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Additionally, heavy scalar particles known as moduli, predicted by String Theory, can be produced both via Hawking evaporation and through amplification by a mechanism called Superradiance Instability in the case of spinning PBHs. These moduli can subsequently decay into ALPs, further amplifying their abundance. In this work, we calculate the number density of ALPs in the presence of moduli enhanced by Superradiance for Kerr PBHs. Using current limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck satellite observations, we derive updated constraints on this scenario.</description>

      <title>A theoretical approach to density-split clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical model for density-split correlation functions, that probe galaxy clustering in different density environments. Specifically, we focus on the cross-correlation between density-split regions and the tracer density field. We show that these correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the two-point probability density function (PDF) of the density field, or equivalently, its bias function. We derive analytical predictions using three levels of approximation for the two-point PDF: a bivariate Gaussian distribution, a bivariate shifted log-normal distribution, and a prediction based on the Large Deviation Theory framework. Under spherical symmetry $\unicode{x2013}$ where spherical collapse dynamics apply, such as for count-in-cell densities with spherical top-hat smoothing $\unicode{x2013}$ LDT predicts the density two-point PDF in the large-separation regime relative to the smoothing radius. We validate our model against dark matter N-body simulations in real space, incorporating Poisson shot noise. Our results show that the LDT predictions outperform the log-normal approximation, and agrees with simulations on large scales within the cosmic variance of a typical DESI DR1 sample, despite relying on only one degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.</description>

      <title>Luminous Mid-IR Selected Type-2 Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 I: Selection, Composite Photometry, and Spectral Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22$\rm \mu$m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous ($\rm flux_{W4} &gt; 5mJy$, i.e., $12.62 &lt; W4 &lt; 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude$), optically faint ($r &gt; 23$) or with red color ($r - W4 &gt;8.38$). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range $0.88 - 2.99$ (12 are at $z&gt;2$). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1$\rm \mu$m to 10$\rm \mu$m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of $L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s$. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1}$ and around SMBH masses $\rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}$, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at $z&gt;2$. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a dynamical systems study of the purely kinetic k-essence. Although these models have been studied in the past, a full study of the dynamics in the phase space incorporating the stability conditions for theoretical consistency is lacking. Our results confirm in a very rigorous and clear way that these models i) can not explain in a unified way the dark matter and dark energy components of the cosmic fluid and ii) are not adequate to explain the existing observational evidence, in particular the observed amount of cosmic structure.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high density matter blobs that developed due to fluctuations. We study here such a collapse in the inflationary epoch which has been assumed earlier to form primordial black holes. The potentials for inflation are chosen to be a general polynomial in its scalar field $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$. Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits, dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the inflationary field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) fall within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.

      <title>CMB-HD as a Probe of Dark Matter on Sub-Galactic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show for the first time that high-resolution CMB lensing observations can probe structure on sub-galactic scales. In particular, a CMB-HD experiment can probe out to k ~ 55 h/Mpc, corresponding to halo masses of about $10^8 M_{\odot}$. Over the range 0.005 h/Mpc &lt; k &lt; 55 h/Mpc, spanning four orders of magnitude, the total lensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra is greater than 1900. CMB-HD gains most of the lensing SNR at small scales from the temperature power spectrum, as opposed to the lensing spectrum. These lensing measurements allow CMB-HD to distinguish between cold dark matter (CDM) and non-CDM models that change the matter power spectrum on sub-galactic scales. We also find that CMB-HD can distinguish between baryonic feedback effects and non-CDM models due to the different way each impacts the lensing signal. The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power spectrum further constrains non-CDM models that deviate from CDM on the smallest scales CMB-HD measures. For example, CMB-HD can detect 1 keV warm dark matter (WDM) at 30$\sigma$, or rule out about 7 keV WDM at 95% CL, in a $\Lambda$WDM + $N_{\rm{eff}} + \sum m_\nu + m_{\rm{WDM}} + \log_{10}T_{\rm{AGN}} + A_{\rm{kSZ}} + n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ model; here $T_{\rm{AGN}}$ characterizes the strength of the feedback, and $A_{\rm{kSZ}}$ and $n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ allow freedom in the amplitude and slope of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. This work provides an initial exploration of what can be achieved with reasonable assumptions about systematic effects. We make the CMB-HD Fisher code used here publicly available, and note that it can be modified to use any non-CDM model that changes the matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>The History of Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We overview the history of primordial black hole (PBH) research from the first papers around 50 years ago to the present epoch. The history may be divided into four periods, the dividing lines being marked by three key developments: inflation on the theoretical front and the detection of microlensing events by the MACHO project and gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA project on the observation front. However, they are also characterised by somewhat different focuses of research. The period 1967-1980 covered the groundbreaking work on PBH formation and evaporation. The period 1980-1996 mainly focussed on their formation, while the period 1996-2016 consolidated the work on formation but also collated the constraints on the PBH abundance. In the period 2016-2024 there was a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs and - while opinions about the strength of the purported evidence vary - this has motivated more careful studies of some aspects of the subject. Certainly the soaring number of papers on PBHs in this last period indicates a growing interest in the topic.</description>

      <title>Measuring the matter fluctuations in the Local Universe with the ALFALFA catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology describes the matter fluctuations through the matter power spectrum, where $\sigma_{8} \equiv \sigma_{8,0} \equiv \sigma_{8}(z = 0)$, defined at the scale of $8 h^{-1}$ Mpc, acts as a normalisation parameter. Currently, the literature reports measurements of $\sigma_{8}$ analysing different cosmic tracers, where some of these results were obtained assuming a fiducial cosmology. In this study we measure, in a model-independent approach, the matter fluctuations in the Local Universe using HI extragalactic sources mapped by the ALFALFA survey. Our analyses allow us to test the standard cosmological model under extreme conditions in the highly non-linear Local Universe, quantifying the amplitude of the matter fluctuations there. Our work directly measures $\sigma_{8}$ using the 3-dimensional distances of the HI sources determined by the ALFALFA survey without assuming a fiducial cosmology, resulting in a robust model-independent measurement of $\sigma_{8}$. Our methodology involves the construction of suitable mock catalogues to simulate the large scale structure features observed in the data, applying the 2-point correlation function, and making use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the parameters. Analysing these data we measure $\sigma_8 = 0.78 \pm 0.04$ for $h = 0.6727$, $\sigma_8 = 0.80 \pm 0.05$ for $h = 0.698$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.83 \pm 0.05$ for $h = 0.7304$. Considering the data pairs $(\sigma_8, H_0)$ from the Planck CMB and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) CMB-lensing analyses, our measurement agrees with them within $1\,\sigma$ confidence level. From a model-independent perspective, we find that the scale where the matter fluctuation is $1$ is $R = 7.2 \pm 1.5~\text{Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Inferring dark energy properties from the scale factor parametrisation</title>

Abstract: We propose and implement a novel test to assess deviations from well-established concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology while inferring dark energy properties. In contrast to the commonly implemented parametric forms of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS), we test the validity of the cosmological constant on the more fundamental scale factor [$a(t)$] which determines the expansion rate of the Universe. We constrain our extended `general model' using the late-time observables. The posterior of the dark energy EoS is mainly constrained to be quintessence-like naturally excluding physically unviable regions such as phantom crossings or exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial magnetic fields through 21-cm physics: Bounds and forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) may significantly influence 21-cm physics via two mechanisms: (i) magnetic heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) through ambipolar diffusion (AD) and decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (DT), (ii) impact on the star formation rate density (SFRD) through small-scale enhancement of the matter power spectrum. In this analysis, we integrate both of these effects within a unified analytical framework and use it to determine upper bounds on the parameter space of a nearly scale-invariant non-helical PMF in the light of the global 21-cm signal observed by EDGES. Our findings reveal that the joint consideration of both effects furnishes constraints of the order $B_0\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ nG on the present-day magnetic field strength, which are considerably tighter compared to earlier analyses. We subsequently explore the prospects of detecting such a magnetized 21-cm power spectrum at the upcoming SKA-Low mission. For the relevant parameters of the PMF ($B_0$ and $n_{\!_{B}}$) and the excess radio background ($\xi$), SNR estimation and Fisher forecast analysis indicate that it may be possible to constrain these three parameters with relative $1\sigma$ uncertainties $\lesssim10\%$ and an associated SNR $\gtrsim10$ at SKA-Low. This also leads to possible correlations among these three parameters, thus revealing intriguing trends of interplay among the various physical processes involved.</description>

Abstract: A space-dependent mean for cosmological perturbations negates the ansatz of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, and hence ergodicity. In this work, we construct such a primordial mean of scalar perturbations from an alternative quantum initial state (coherent state) and examine the associated power and bi-spectra. A multitude of cosmological tests based on these spectra are discussed. We find that current cosmological data doesn't favor a primordial mean over large scales and strong constraints arise from the limit on bispectrum from Planck data. At small scales, this hypothesis can be tested by future observables such as $\mu$-distortion of CMB.</description>

      <title>A halo model approach for mock catalogs of time-variable strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delays in both galaxy- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses have recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of the Hubble tension. Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 3500 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from axion domain walls in level crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves (GWs) emission and the massive primordial black holes (PBHs) formation from the light QCD axion scenario. We consider the axion domain walls formation from the level crossing induced by the mass mixing between the light $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion and axion-like particle. A general mixing case is considered that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the level crossing. The domain walls must annihilate before dominating the Universe to avoid the cosmological catastrophe. Then we focus our attention on the GWs emission from the domain walls annihilation and the PBHs formation from the domain walls collapse. We show the predicted GWs spectra with the peak frequency $\sim 0.2\, \rm nHz$ and the peak amplitude $\sim 5\times 10^{-9}$, which can be tested by the future pulsar timing array projects. In addition, during the domain walls annihilation, the closed walls could shrink to the Schwarzschild radius and collapse into the PBHs. We find that the PBHs in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10^5-10^8) M_\odot$ could potentially form in this scenario and account for a small fraction $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Graviton- and Inflaton-mediated Dark Matter Production after Large Field Polynomial Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomial inflation is a simple cosmological scenario, which fits the cosmic microwave background data well. It provides testable predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the running of the spectral index. In this work, we investigate the production of Dirac dark matter (DM) within the framework of large-field polynomial inflation. We study all relevant production channels including $i$) non-thermal production through inflaton decays and scatterings, and $ii$) thermal production from scattering of standard model particles mediated by inflatons and gravitons. In contrast to small-field polynomial inflation, where inflaton decay dominates DM production, we find that graviton-mediated processes can be dominant in the large-field scenario. For DM lighter than the inflaton, we demonstrate that the interplay between graviton- and inflaton-mediated production channels give rise to non-trivial relations between the DM mass and the reheating temperature required to account for the DM relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Problem of Distributional Shifts: Correcting Misspecified, High-Dimensional Data-Driven Priors for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications, it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g. a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations, and we showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that, starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on resonant DM annihilations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of BBN constraints from photodisintegration for scenarios in which dark-matter annihilations are resonantly-enhanced. To this end, we implement and make available a new class ResonanceModel within an updated version v1.3.0 of ACROPOLIS. While the corresponding implementation is done in a rather model-independent way, we also make available three benchmark models that can be used to calculate constraints for more concrete scenarios. Using this new version of ACROPOLIS, we present for the first time the corresponding constraints on resonantly-enhanced $s$-wave and $p$-wave annihilations. We show that for $s$-wave annihilations the bounds are usually very similar to the ones without a resonance, while for $p$-wave annihilations the bounds can be significantly stronger.
  The updated version v1.3.0 of ACROPOLIS can be found at https://github.com/hep-mh/acropolis .</description>

      <title>Does the fluid-static equilibrium of a self-gravitating isothermal sphere of van der Waals' gas present multiple solutions?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take up the investigation we left in the future-work stack in Giordano \textit{et al.} [``Fluid statics of a self-gravitational isothermal sphere of van der Waals' gas,'' Phys. Fluids \textbf{36}, 056127 (2024)], in which we pointed out the obvious necessity to inquire about the existence or absence of values of the characteristic numbers \itm{\alphay} and \itm{\betay} in correspondence to which the perfect-gas model's self gravitational effects, namely, upper boundedness of the gravitational number, spiraling behavior of peripheral density, oscillating behavior of central density, and the existence of multiple solutions corresponding to the same value of the gravitational number, appear also for the van der Waals' model. The development of our investigation brings to the conversion of our M$_{2}$ scheme based on a second-order differential equation into an equivalent system of two first-order differential equations that incorporates Milne's homology invariant variables. The converted scheme \fomt\ turns out to be much more efficacious than the M$_{2}$ scheme in terms of numerical calculations' easiness and richness of results. We use the perfect-gas model as benchmark to test the \fomt\ scheme; we re-derive familiar results and put them in a more general and rational perspective that paves the way to deal with the van der Waals' gas model. We introduce variable transformations that turn out to be the key to study (almost) analytically the monotonicity of the peripheral density with respect to variations of the gravitational number. The study brings to the proof that the gravitational number is not constrained by upper boundedness, the peripheral density does not spiral, and the central density does not oscillate for any couple of values assumed by the characteristic numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$; however, multiple solutions ...</description>
