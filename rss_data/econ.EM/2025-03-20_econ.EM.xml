      <title>Partial Identification in Moment Models with Incomplete Data via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a unified approach to study partial identification of a finite-dimensional parameter defined by a moment equality model with incomplete data. We establish a novel characterization of the identified set for the true parameter in terms of a continuum of inequalities defined by optimal transport costs. For a special class of moment functions, we show that the identified set is convex, and its support function can be easily computed by solving an optimal transport problem. We demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach through several running examples, including the linear projection model and two algorithmic fairness measures.</description>

      <title>Hidden Group Time Profiles: Heterogeneous Drawdown Behaviours in Retirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.01505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates retirement decumulation behaviours using the Grouped Fixed-Effects (GFE) estimator applied to Australian panel data on drawdowns from phased withdrawal retirement income products. Behaviours exhibited by the distinct latent groups identified suggest that retirees may adopt simple heuristics determining how they draw down their accumulated wealth. Two extensions to the original GFE methodology are proposed: a latent group label-matching procedure which broadens bootstrap inference to include the time profile estimates, and a modified estimation procedure for models with time-invariant additive fixed effects estimated using unbalanced data.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Regression Discontinuity: An Event-Study Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a novel argument to identify economically interpretable intertemporal treatment effects in dynamic regression discontinuity designs (RDDs). Specifically, I develop a dynamic potential outcomes model and reformulate two assumptions from the difference-in-differences literature, no anticipation and common trends, to attain point identification of cutoff-specific impulse responses. The estimand of each target parameter can be expressed as the sum of two static RDD contrasts, thereby allowing for nonparametric estimation and inference with standard local polynomial methods. I also propose a nonparametric approach to aggregate treatment effects across calendar time and treatment paths, leveraging a limited path independence restriction to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. I apply this approach to estimate the dynamic effects of school district expenditure authorizations on housing prices in Wisconsin.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Forecasting with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</description>

      <title>Robust Identification in Randomized Experiments with Noncompliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrument variable (IV) methods are widely used in empirical research to identify causal effects of a policy. In the local average treatment effect (LATE) framework, the IV estimand identifies the LATE under three main assumptions: random assignment, exclusion restriction, and monotonicity. However, these assumptions are often questionable in many applications, leading some researchers to doubt the causal interpretation of the IV estimand. This paper considers a robust identification of causal parameters in a randomized experiment setting with noncompliance where the standard LATE assumptions could be violated. We discuss identification under two sets of weaker assumptions: random assignment and exclusion restriction (without monotonicity), and random assignment and monotonicity (without exclusion restriction). We derive sharp bounds on some causal parameters under these two sets of relaxed LATE assumptions. Finally, we apply our method to revisit the random information experiment conducted in Bursztyn, Gonz\'alez, and Yanagizawa-Drott (2020) and find that the standard LATE assumptions are jointly incompatible in this application. We then estimate the robust identified sets under the two sets of relaxed assumptions.</description>
