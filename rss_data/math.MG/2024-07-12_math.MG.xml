      <title>Fixed point theorems for generalized $\theta-\phi-$contraction mappings in rectangular quasi b-metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized version of both rectangular metric spaces and rectangular quasi-metric spaces is known as rectangular quasi b-metric spaces (RQB-MS). In the current work, we define generalized $( \theta,\phi) $-contraction mappings and study fixed point (FP) results for the maps introduced in the setting of rectangular quasi b-metric spaces. Our results generalize many existing results. We also provide examples in support of our main findings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ozawa and Shioya proposed the limit formula for observable diameters of pyramids under weak convergence. However, we find a constructive counterexample to an inequality used in their proof. In this paper, we correct the inequality and verify the limit formula.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Valuations on Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all continuous valuations on the space of finite convex functions with values in the same space which are dually epi-translation-invariant and equi- resp. contravariant with respect to volume-preserving linear maps. We thereby identify the valuation-theoretic functional analogues of the difference body map and show that there does not exist a generalization of the projection body map in this setting. This non-existence result is shown to also hold true for valuations with values in the space of convex functions that are finite in a neighborhood of the origin.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs and orders of real quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting and classifying symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SICs or SIC-POVMs), that is, sets of $d^2$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$. For $4 \leq d \leq 90$, we show the number of known equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of (not necessarily invertible) ideal classes in the real quadratic order of discriminant $(d+1)(d-3)$. Equivalently, this is the number of $\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ conjugacy classes in $\mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of trace $d-1$. We conjecture the equality extends to all $d \geq 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies more that one equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs for every $d &gt; 22$.
  Additionally, we refine the "class field hypothesis" of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SIC. The class fields conjecturally associated to SICs in dimension $d$ come with a natural partial order under inclusion; we show that the natural inclusions of these fields are strict, except in a small family of cases.</description>

      <title>Geometric Approach and Closed Exact Formulae for the Lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a geometric approach to the lasso. We study the tangency of the level sets of the least square objective function with the polyhedral boundary sets $B(t)$ of the parameters in $\mathbb R^p$ with the $\ell_1$ norm equal to $t$. Here $t$ decreases from the value $\hat t$, which corresponds to the actual, nonconstrained minimizer of the least square objective function, denoted by $\hat\beta$. We derive closed exact formulae for the solution of the lasso under the full rank assumption. Our method does not assume iterative numerical procedures and it is, thus, computationally more efficient than the existing algorithms for solving the lasso. We also establish several important general properties of the solutions of the lasso. We prove that each lasso solution form a simple polygonal chain in $\mathbb{R}^p$ with $\hat\beta$ and the origin as the endpoints. There are no two segments of the polygonal chain that are parallel. We prove that such a polygonal chain can intersect interiors of more than one orthant in $\mathbb{R}^p$, but it cannot intersect interiors of more than $p$ orthants, which is, in general, the best possible estimate for non-normalized data. We prove that if a polygonal chain passes from the interior of one to the interior of another orthant, then it never again returns to the interior of the former. The intersection of a chain and the interior of an orthant coincides with a segment minus its end points, which belongs to a ray having $\hat\beta$ as its initial point. We illustrate the results using real data examples as well as especially crafted examples with hypothetical data. Already in $p=2$ case we show a striking difference in the maximal number of quadrants a polygonal chain of a lasso solution can intersect in the case of normalized data, which is $1$ vs. nonnormalized data, which is $2$.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous attractors and box dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterated function systems (IFSs) are one of the most important tools for building examples of fractal sets exhibiting some kind of `approximate self-similarity'. Examples include self-similar sets, self-affine sets etc. A beautiful variant on the standard IFS model was introduced by Barnsley and Demko in 1985 where one builds an \emph{inhomogeneous} attractor by taking the closure of the orbit of a fixed compact condensation set under a given standard IFS. In this expository article I will discuss the dimension theory of inhomogeneous attractors, giving several examples and some open questions. I will focus on the upper box dimension with emphasis on how to derive good estimates, and when these estimates fail to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Bounds on some geometric functionals of high dimensional Brownian convex hulls and their inverse processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two-sided bounds on the expected values of several geometric functionals of the convex hull of Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and their inverse processes. This extends some recent results of McRedmond and Xu (2017), Jovaleki\'{c} (2021), and Cygan, \^{S}ebek, and the first author (2023) from the plane to higher dimensions. All of our bounds capture the correct order of asymptotic growth or decay in the dimension $n$.</description>

Abstract: We prove boundedness, H\"older continuity, Harnack inequality results for local quasiminima to elliptic double phase problems of $p$-Laplace type in the general context of metric measure spaces. The proofs follow a variational approach and they are based on the De Giorgi method, a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fine local scaling properties of a class of self-affine fractal sets called Gatzouras-Lalley carpets. More precisely, we establish a formula for the Assouad spectrum of all Gatzouras-Lalley carpets as the concave conjugate of an explicit piecewise-analytic function combined with a simple parameter change. Our formula implies a number of novel properties for the Assouad spectrum not previously observed for dynamically invariant sets; in particular, the Assouad spectrum can be a non-trivial differentiable function on the entire domain $(0,1)$ and can be strictly concave on open intervals. Our proof introduces a general framework for covering arguments using techniques developed in the context of multifractal analysis, including the method of types from large deviations theory and Lagrange duality from optimisation theory.</description>

      <title>Is every triangle a trajectory of an elliptical billiard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named "Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>
