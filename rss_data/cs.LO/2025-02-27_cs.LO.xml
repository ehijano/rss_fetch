      <title>Compositional Verification of Concurrency Using Past-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning about shared variable concurrent programs poses significant challenges due to the need to account for interference between concurrently executing threads. Traditional verification approaches often fall short in terms of modularity and composability, which are essential for scalable and maintainable verification. We present a method for modular and compositional verification of concurrent programs using past-time temporal epistemic logic. Our approach builds on Halpern and Moses' epistemic logic framework and incorporates past-time temporal operators to capture the temporal context of thread interactions. We formalize the semantics of our logic, introduce a compositional proof system for reasoning about concurrent programs, and demonstrate its application. The expressiveness of our proposed logic provides a rigorous foundation to verify concurrent systems compositionally.</description>

      <title>Distributed Transition System with Tags and Value-wise Metric, for Privacy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a logical framework named Distributed Labeled Tagged Transition System (DLTTS), using concepts from Probabilistic Automata, Probabilistic Concurrent Systems, and Probabilistic labelled transition systems. We show that DLTTS can be used to formally model how a given piece of private information P (e.g., a set of tuples) stored in a given database D can get captured progressively by an adversary A repeatedly querying D, enhancing the knowledge acquired from the answers to these queries with relational deductions using certain additional non-private data. The database D is assumed protected with generalization mechanisms. We also show that, on a large class of databases, metrics can be defined 'value-wise', and more general notions of adjacency between data bases can be defined, based on these metrics. These notions can also play a role in differentially private protection mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A new introduction rule for disjunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Natural Deduction with a third introduction rule for the disjunction, $\vee$-i3, with a conclusion $\Gamma\vdash A\vee B$, but both premises $\Gamma\vdash A$ and $\Gamma\vdash B$. This rule is admissible in Natural Deduction. This extension is interesting in several respects. First, it permits to solve a well-known problem in logics with interstitial rules that have a weak introduction property: closed cut-free proofs end with an introduction rule, except in the case of disjunctions. With this new introduction rule, we recover the strong introduction property: closed cut-free proofs always end with an introduction. Second, the termination proof of this proof system is simpler than that of the usual propositional Natural Deduction with interstitial rules, as it does not require the use of the so-called ultra-reduction rules. Third, this proof system, in its linear version, has applications to quantum computing: the $\vee$-i3 rule enables the expression of quantum measurement, without the cost of introducing a new connective. Finally, even in logics without interstitial rules, the rule $\vee$-i3 is useful to reduce commuting cuts, although, in this paper, we leave the termination of such reduction as an open problem.</description>

      <title>Equational Reasoning Modulo Commutativity in Languages with Binders (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many formal languages include binders as well as operators that satisfy equational axioms, such as commutativity. Here we consider the nominal language, a general formal framework which provides support for the representation of binders, freshness conditions and $\alpha$-renaming. Rather than relying on the usual freshness constraints, we introduce a nominal algebra which employs permutation fixed-point constraints in $\alpha$-equivalence judgements, seamlessly integrating commutativity into the reasoning process. We establish its proof-theoretical properties and provide a sound and complete semantics in the setting of nominal sets. Additionally, we propose a novel algorithm for nominal unification modulo commutativity, which we prove terminating and correct. By leveraging fixed-point constraints, our approach ensures a finitary unification theory, unlike standard methods relying on freshness constraints. This framework offers a robust foundation for structural induction and recursion over syntax with binders and commutative operators, enabling reasoning in settings such as first-order logic and the $\pi$-calculus.</description>

      <title>Generalization Problems with Atom-Variables in Languages with Binders and Equational Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization problems in languages with binders involve computing the most common structure between expressions while respecting bound variable renaming and freshness constraints. These problems often lack a least general solution. However, leveraging nominal techniques, we previously demonstrated that a semantic approach with atom-variables enables the elimination of redundant solutions and allows for computing unique least general generalizations (LGGs). In this work, we extend this approach to handle associative (A), commutative (C), and associative-commutative (AC) equational theories. We present a sound and weak complete algorithm for solving equational generalization problems, which generates finite weak minimal complete sets of LGGs for each theory. A key challenge arises from solving equivariance problems while taking into account these equational theories, as identifying redundant generalizations requires recognizing when one expression (with binders) is a renaming of another while possibly considering permutations of sub-expressions. This unexpected interaction between renaming and equational reasoning made this particularly difficult, necessitating semantic tests within the equivariance algorithm. Given that these equational theories naturally induce exponentially large LGG sets due to subexpression permutations, future work could explore restricted theory fragments where the generalization problem remains unitary. In these fragments, LGGs can be computed efficiently in polynomial time, offering practical benefits for symbolic computation and automated reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Faithful Logic Embeddings in HOL -- A recipe to have it all: deep and shallow, automated and interactive, heavy and light, proofs and counterexamples, meta and object level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep and shallow embeddings of non-classical logics in classical higher-order logic have been explored, implemented, and used in various automated reasoning tools in recent years. This paper presents a recipe for the simultaneous deployment of different forms of deep and shallow embeddings in classical higher-order logic, enabling not only flexible interactive and automated theorem proving and counterexample finding at meta and object level, but also automated faithfulness proofs between the logic embeddings. The approach, which is fruitful for logic education, research and application, is deliberately illustrated here using simple propositional modal logic. However, the work presented is conceptual in nature and not limited to such a simple logic context.</description>

      <title>Foundations for Deductive Verification of Continuous Probabilistic Programs: From Lebesgue to Riemann and Back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lay out novel foundations for the computer-aided verification of guaranteed bounds on expected outcomes of imperative probabilistic programs featuring (i) general loops, (ii) continuous distributions, and (iii) conditioning. To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.</description>

      <title>A BV-Category of Spacetime Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Chu construction to functorially build BV-categories from duoidal categories, demonstrating that candidate models of BV-logic can be cofreely constructed from a fragment of a model of Retor\'e's sequencing operator. By using this construction to show that the strong Hyland envelope is a BV-category, we find a way to build a canonical model of spatio-temporal relationships between agents in spacetime from any symmetric monoidal category. The concrete physical interpretation of spacetime events in this model as intervention-context pairs resolves deficiencies in previous attempts to give a general categorical semantics to quantum supermaps.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of PLCs as a Service: A CERN-GSI Safety-Critical Case Study (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increased technological complexity and demand for software reliability require organizations to formally design and verify their safety-critical programs to minimize systematic failures. Formal methods are recommended by functional safety standards (e.g., by IEC 61511 for the process industry and by the generic IEC 61508) and play a crucial role. Their structured approach reduces ambiguity in system requirements, facilitating early error detection. This paper introduces a formal verification service for PLC (programmable logic controller) programs compliant with functional safety standards, providing external expertise to organizations while eliminating the need for extensive internal training. It offers a cost-effective solution to meet the rising demands for formal verification processes. The approach is extended to include modeling time-dependent, know-how-protected components, enabling formal verification of real safety-critical applications. A case study shows the application of PLC formal verification as a service provided by CERN in a safety-critical installation at the GSI particle accelerator facility.</description>

      <title>Crash-Stop Failures in Asynchronous Multiparty Session Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11851v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Session types provide a typing discipline for message-passing systems. However, their theory often assumes an ideal world: one in which everything is reliable and without failures. Yet this is in stark contrast with distributed systems in the real world. To address this limitation, we introduce a new asynchronous multiparty session types (MPST) theory with crash-stop failures, where processes may crash arbitrarily and cease to interact after crashing. We augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling branches, and integrate crash-stop failure semantics into types and processes. Our approach requires no user-level syntax extensions for global types, and features a formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex behaviours induced by crashed/crash handling processes.
  Our new theory covers the entire spectrum, ranging from the ideal world of total reliability to entirely unreliable scenarios where any process may crash, using optional reliability assumptions. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the sound and complete correspondence between global and local type semantics, which guarantee deadlock-freedom, protocol conformance, and liveness of well-typed processes by construction, even in the presence of crashes.</description>

      <title>Completeness of two fragments of a logic for conditional strategic reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical logics for strategic reasoning, such as Coalition Logic and Alternating-time Temporal Logic, formalize absolute strategic reasoning about the unconditional strategic abilities of agents to achieve their goals. Goranko and Ju, in two recent papers, introduced a Logic for Conditional Strategic Reasoning (CSR). However, its completeness is still an open problem. CSR has three featured operators, and one of them has the following reading: For some action of A that guarantees the achievement of her goal, B has an action to guarantee the achievement of his goal. This operator makes good sense when A is cooperating with B. The logic about this operator is called Logic for Cooperating Conditional Strategic Reasoning (CCSR). In this paper, we prove the completeness of two fragments of CCSR: the liability fragment and the ability fragment. The key ingredients of our proof approach include standard disjunctions, the validity-reduction condition of standard disjunctions, abstract game forms, and their realization, and the derivability-reduction condition of standard disjunctions. The approach has good potential to be applied to the completeness of CSR and other strategic logics.</description>

      <title>Lifted Inference beyond First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11738v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted First Order Model Counting (WFOMC) is fundamental to probabilistic inference in statistical relational learning models. As WFOMC is known to be intractable in general ($\#$P-complete), logical fragments that admit polynomial time WFOMC are of significant interest. Such fragments are called domain liftable. Recent works have shown that the two-variable fragment of first order logic extended with counting quantifiers ($\mathrm{C^2}$) is domain-liftable. However, many properties of real-world data, like acyclicity in citation networks and connectivity in social networks, cannot be modeled in $\mathrm{C^2}$, or first order logic in general. In this work, we expand the domain liftability of $\mathrm{C^2}$ with multiple such properties. We show that any $\mathrm{C^2}$ sentence remains domain liftable when one of its relations is restricted to represent a directed acyclic graph, a connected graph, a tree (resp. a directed tree) or a forest (resp. a directed forest). All our results rely on a novel and general methodology of "counting by splitting". Besides their application to probabilistic inference, our results provide a general framework for counting combinatorial structures. We expand a vast array of previous results in discrete mathematics literature on directed acyclic graphs, phylogenetic networks, etc.</description>
