      <title>Directional cues affect the collective behaviour of Self propelled particles in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the effect of quenched disorder on the characteristic of self-propelled particles in one-dimension. Here,particles interact with disorder which serve as directional cues. The study investigates how the density of the disorder influence the emergence of ordering and clustering in the collection of the self propelled particles. We introduce the microscopic model as well as corresponding coarse-grained equations of motion for the local density and the orientation of particle. Disorder affects the macroscopic ordering in the system, the size of the ordered clusters decays algebraically with disorder. Further, the disorder also affects the clustering of particles; in the presence of disorder, a big macroscopic cluster breaks into small clusters, leads to the localization of particles around it and results in high density around the disorder.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Surfactants Drive Anisotropic Colloidal Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal building blocks with re-configurable shapes and dynamic interactions can exhibit unusual self-assembly behaviors and pathways. In this work, we consider the phase behavior of colloids coated with surface-mobile polymer brushes that behave as "dynamic surfactants." Unlike traditional polymer-grafted colloids, we show that colloids coated with dynamic surfactants can acquire anisotropic macroscopic assemblies, even for spherical colloids with isotropic attractive interactions. We use Brownian Dynamics simulations and dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to demonstrate that time-dependent reorganization of the dynamic surfactants leads to phase diagrams with anisotropic assemblies. We observed that the microscopic polymer distributions impose unique geometric constraints between colloids that control their packing into lamellar, string, and vesicle phases. Our work may help discover versatile building blocks and provide extensive design freedom for assembly out of thermodynamic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Motility Modulates the Partitioning of Bacteria in Aqueous Two-Phase Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the partitioning of motile bacteria into different thermodynamic states of a phase-separated dextran (DEX)/polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous mixture. While non-motile bacteria partition exclusively into the DEX-rich phase in all conditions tested, we observed that motile bacteria transverse the soft DEX/PEG interface and partition variably among the two phases. For our model organism \textit{Bacillus subtilis}, the fraction of motile bacteria in the DEX-rich phase increased from 0.58 to 1 as we increased DEX composition within the two-phase region. We hypothesized that the chemical affinity between dextran and the bacteria cell wall acts to weakly confine the bacteria within the DEX-rich phase; however, motility can generate sufficient mechanical forces to overcome the soft confinement and propel the bacteria into the PEG-rich phase. Using optical tweezers to drag a bacterium across the DEX/PEG interface, we developed a model to predict the overall phase partitioning based on a competition between the interfacial forces and bacterial propulsive forces. Our measurements are supported by a theoretical model of dilute active rods embedded within a periodic soft confinement potential.</description>

      <title>Rheology of three dimensional granular chute flows at large inertial numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inertial number-based rheology, popularly known as the JFP model, is well known for describing the rheology of granular materials in the dense flow regime. While most of the recent studies focus on the steady-state rheology of granular materials, the time-dependent rheology of such materials has received less attention. Owing to this fact, we perform three-dimensional DEM simulations of frictional inelastic spheres flowing down an inclined bumpy surface varying over a wide range of inclination angles and restitution coefficients. We show that steady, fully developed flows are possible at inclinations much higher than those predicted from the JFP model rheology. We show that, in addition to a modified effective friction law, the rheological description also needs to account for the stress anisotropy by means of a first and second normal stress difference law.</description>

      <title>Dynamic constraints predict the relaxation of granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials such as sand, powders, and food grains are ubiquitous in civil engineering, geoscience, agriculture, and medicine. While the influence of friction between the grains on the static structure of these systems is well understood, its impact on the dynamics is an open problem. Here we use particle-based simulations of a granular pack under cyclic shear and discover that the relaxation time of the system is a non-monotonic function of friction. By introducing the concept of dynamic constraints, we reveal that this re-entrant dynamics is due to the competition between increasing frictional coupling and a concurrent change in the structure of the granular pack. Our theoretical approach, which unifies the dynamics of friction-less systems with frictional ones, is applicable to other systems that have a complex free energy landscape and a dynamics which involves time-dependent constraints, thus setting the stage for a description of the dynamic behavior of a large class of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal crawling: from mechanical to chemical actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking inspiration from the crawling motion of biological cells on a substrate, we consider a physical model of self-propulsion where the spatio-temporal driving can involve both, a mechanical actuation by active force couples, and a chemical actuation through controlled mass turnover. We show that the competition and cooperation between these two modalities of active driving can drastically broaden the performance repertoire of the crawler. When the material turnover is slow and the mechanical driving dominates, we find that the highest velocity at a given energetic cost is reached when actuation takes the form of an active force configuration propagating as a traveling wave. As the rate of material turnover increases, and the chemical driving starts to dominate the mechanical one, such a peristalsis-type control progressively loses its efficacy, yielding to a standing wave type driving which involves an interplay between the mechanical and chemical actuation. Our analysis suggests a new paradigm for the optimal design of crawling biomimetic robots where the conventional purely mechanical driving through distributed force actuators is complemented by a distributed chemical control of the material remodeling inside the force-transmitting machinery.</description>

      <title>Matrix viscoelasticity decouples bubble growth and dynamics in coarsening foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-driven coarsening triggers bubble rearrangements in liquid foams. Our experiments show that changing the continuous phase rheology can alter these internal bubble dynamics without influencing the coarsening kinetics. Through bubble tracking, we find that increasing the matrix yield stress permits bubble growth without stress relaxation via neighbor-switching events, promoting more spatially homogeneous rearrangements and decoupling bubble growth from dynamics. This eventually leads to a structural change which directly impacts the foam mechanical and stability properties, essential for applications in various technological and industrial contexts.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusiophoretic propulsion of a spheroidal particle in a shear-thinning fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear-thinning viscosity is a non-Newtonian behaviour that active particles often encounter in biological fluids such as blood and mucus. The fundamental question of how this ubiquitous non-Newtonian rheology affects the propulsion of active particles has attracted substantial interest. In particular, spherical Janus particles driven by self-diffusiophresis, a major physico-chemical propulsion mechanism of synthetic active particles, were shown to always swim slower in a shear-thinning fluid than in a Newtonian fluid. In this work, we move beyond the spherical limit to examine the effect of particle eccentricity on self-diffusiophoretic propulsion in a shear-thinning fluid. We use a combination of asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations to show that shear-thinning rheology can enhance self-diffusiophoretic propulsion of a spheroidal particle, in stark contrast to previous findings for the spherical case. A systematic characterization of the dependence of the propulsion speed on the particle's active surface coverage has also uncovered an intriguing feature associated with the propulsion speeds of a pair of complementarily coated particles not previously reported. Symmetry arguments are presented to elucidate how this new feature emerges as a combined effect of anisotropy of the spheroidal geometry and nonlinearity in fluid rheology.</description>

Abstract: Progress in electrochemical applications of ionic liquids builds on an understanding of electrical double-layer. This computational study focuses on structure-determined quantities -- maximum packing density, potentials and capacitances -- evaluated using a one-electrode electrical double-layer model. Interfaces of 40 studied ions are grouped into four distinct classes according to their characteristic packing at the model surface. The simulations suggest that the exact screening by a monolayer of counter-ions (preceding the crowding of ions) is unlikely for common ions within the electrochemical stability window of corresponding ionic liquids. This work discusses how the assessed structure-determined quantities can guide the experimental tuning of (electro/mechano)chemical properties and characterising the structure of ionic liquid-electrode interfaces.</description>

Abstract: The Shuttleworth equation: a linear stress-strain relation ubiquitously used in modeling the behavior of soft surfaces. Its validity in the realm of materials subject to large deformation is a topic of current debate. Here, we allow for large deformation by deriving the constitutive behavior of the surface from the general framework of finite kinematics. We distinguish cases of finite and infinitesimal surface relaxation preceding an infinitesimal applied deformation. The Shuttleworth equation identifies as the Cauchy stress measure in the fully linearized setting. We show that both in finite and linearized cases, measured elastic constants depend on the utilized stress measure. In addition, we discuss the physical implications of our results and analyze the impact of surface relaxation on the estimation of surface elastic moduli in the light of two different test cases.</description>

      <title>Oscillating edge current in polar active fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense bacterial suspensions exhibit turbulent behaviour called ``bacterial turbulence''. The behavior of the bulk unconstrained bacterial turbulence is described well by the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equation for the velocity field. However, it remains unclear how we should treat boundary conditions on bacterial turbulence in contact with some boundaries (e.g. solid walls). To be more specific, although the importance of the ``edge current'', the flow along the boundary, has been demonstrated in several experimental studies on confined bacterial suspensions, previous numerical studies based on the TTSH equation employ non-slip boundary conditions and do not seem to describe properly the behavior of bacteria near the boundaries. In this study, we impose a slip boundary condition on the TTSH equation to describe the bacterial motion at boundaries. We develop a method to implement the slip boundary condition. Using this method, we have successfully produced edge current and discovered that the direction of the edge current temporally oscillates. The oscillation can be attributable to the advection term in the TTSH equation. Our work demonstrates that boundary conditions could play an important role in the collective dynamics of active systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular anisotropy plays an important role in the glass transition of a liquid. Recently, a novel bulk glass state has been discovered by optical microscopy experiments on suspensions of ellipsoidal colloids. 'Liquid glass' is a disordered analog of a nematic liquid crystal, in which rotation motion is hindered but particles diffuse freely. Global nematic order is suppressed as clusters of aligned particles intertwine. We perform Brownian dynamics simulations to test the structure and dynamics of a dense system of soft ellipsoidal particles. As seen in experiments and in accordance with predictions from mode coupling theory, on the time scale of our simulations rotation motion is frozen but translation motion persists in liquid glass. Analyses of the dynamic structure functions for translation and rotation corroborates the presence of two separate glass transitions for rotation and translation, respectively. Even though the equilibrium state should be a nematic, aligned structures remain small and orientational order rapidly decays with increasing size. Long-wavelength fluctuations are remnants of the isotropic-nematic transition.</description>

      <title>Elementary processes in dilatational plasticity of glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials typically fail under complex stress states, essentially involving dilatational (volumetric) components that eventually lead to material decohesion/separation. It is therefore important to understand dilatational irreversible deformation -- i.e., dilatational plasticity -- en route to failure. In the context of glasses, much focus has been given to shear (volume-preserving) plasticity, both in terms of the stress states considered and the corresponding material response. Here, using a recently-developed methodology and extensive computer simulations, we shed basic light on the elementary processes mediating dilatational plasticity in glasses. We show that plastic instabilities, corresponding to singularities of the glass Hessian, generically feature both dilatational and shear irreversible strain components. The relative magnitude and statistics of the strain components depend both on the symmetry of the driving stress (e.g., shear vs.~hydrostatic tension) and on the cohesive (attractive) part of the interatomic interaction. We further show that the tensorial shear component of the plastic strain is generally non-planar and also extract the characteristic volume of plastic instabilities. Elucidating the fundamental properties of the elementary micro-mechanical building blocks of plasticity in glasses sets the stage for addressing larger-scale, collective phenomena in dilatational plasticity such as topological changes in the form of cavitation and ductile-to-brittle transitions. As a first step in this direction, we show that the elastic moduli markedly soften during dilatational plastic deformation approaching cavitation.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Tension Dynamics Model of Epithelial Convergent Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epithelial tissue elongation by convergent extension is a key motif of animal morphogenesis. On a coarse scale, cell motion resembles laminar fluid flow; yet in contrast to a fluid, epithelial cells adhere to each other and maintain the tissue layer under actively generated internal tension. To resolve this apparent paradox, we formulate a model in which tissue flow in the tension-dominated regime occurs through adiabatic remodeling of force balance in the network of adherens junctions. We propose that the slow dynamics within the manifold of force-balanced configurations is driven by positive feedback on myosin-generated cytoskeletal tension. Shifting force balance within a tension network causes active cell rearrangements (T1 transitions) resulting in net tissue deformation oriented by initial tension anisotropy. Strikingly, we find that the total extent of tissue deformation depends on the initial cellular packing order. T1s degrade this order so that tissue flow is self-limiting. We explain these findings by showing that coordination of T1s depends on coherence in local tension configurations, quantified by a geometric order parameter in tension space. Our model reproduces the salient tissue- and cell-scale features of germ band elongation during Drosophila gastrulation, in particular the slowdown of tissue flow after approximately twofold elongation concomitant with a loss of order in tension configurations. This suggests local cell geometry contains morphogenetic information and yields experimentally testable predictions. Furthermore, defining biologically controlled active tension dynamics on the manifold of force-balanced states may provide a general approach to the description of morphogenetic flow.</description>
