      <title>Cellular Griffiths-like phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein compartmentalization in the frame of a liquid-liquid phase separation is a key mechanism to optimize spatiotemporal control of biological systems. Such a compartmentalization process reduces the intrinsic noise in protein concentration due to stochasticity in gene expression. Employing Flory-Huggins solution theory, Avramov/Casalini's model, and the Gr\"uneisen parameter, we unprecedentedly propose a cellular Griffiths-like phase (CGLP), which can impact its functionality and self-organization. The here-proposed CGLP is key ranging from the understanding of primary organisms' evolution to the treatment of diseases. Our findings pave the way for an alternative Biophysics approach to investigate coacervation processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic reaction networks with entropic control cost and emergence of mode-switching strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both the dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing a control cost function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This approach naturally accounts for population-specific factors and simplifies the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.</description>

      <title>Information thermodynamics: from physics to neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a perspective on applying the concepts of information thermodynamics, developed recently in non-equilibrium statistical physics, to problems in theoretical neuroscience. Historically, information and energy in neuroscience have been treated separately, in contrast to physics approaches, where the relationship of entropy production with heat is a central idea. It is argued here that also in neural systems information and energy can be considered within the same theoretical framework. Starting from basic ideas of thermodynamics and information theory on a classic Brownian particle, it is shown how noisy neural networks can infer its probabilistic motion. The decoding of the particle motion by neurons is performed with some accuracy and it has some energy cost, and both can be determined using information thermodynamics. In a similar fashion, we also discuss how neural networks in the brain can learn the particle velocity, and maintain that information in the weights of plastic synapses from a physical point of view. Generally, it is shown how the framework of stochastic and information thermodynamics can be used practically to study neural inference, learning, and information storing.</description>

      <title>Nature of the activity-mediated unjamming transition in confluent cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activity-mediated unjamming transition in confluent systems is crucial for embryogenesis, wound healing, cancer metastasis, etc. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, characterized by an interaction parameter $p_0$, and become motile. How does activity affect this unjamming transition? Using molecular dynamics simulations of the active Vertex model and analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT), we show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in equilibrium. The agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic length scale, $\xi_d$, and show that the growing relaxation time accompanies an increasing $\xi_d$. Furthermore, unlike particulate glasses, the static length is proportional to $\xi_d$. Our results highlight the unique nature of the glassy dynamics in confluent systems and rationalize the existing experimental data.</description>

      <title>AMARO: All Heavy-Atom Transferable Neural Network Potentials of Protein Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Low Photon Number Non-Invasive Imaging Through Time-Varying Diffusers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering poses a significant challenge in optical imaging. In microscopy, it leads to progressive degradation of image quality preventing sample examination at increasing depths. As the thickness of the sample increases, the number of photons that can successfully pass through it decreases, leading to a reduced signal and preventing us from obtaining clear images. Imaging becomes even more difficult with dynamic scatterers like biological tissues that change over time. We demonstrate non-invasive imaging of fluorescent objects hidden behind dynamic diffusers. Our reconstruction uses a stack of images recorded for different diffuser realizations and works even when individual camera frames contain small photon numbers.</description>

      <title>A differentiable Gillespie algorithm for simulating chemical kinetics, parameter estimation, and designing synthetic biological circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gillespie algorithm is commonly used to simulate and analyze complex chemical reaction networks. Here, we leverage recent breakthroughs in deep learning to develop a fully differentiable variant of the Gillespie algorithm. The differentiable Gillespie algorithm (DGA) approximates discontinuous operations in the exact Gillespie algorithm using smooth functions, allowing for the calculation of gradients using backpropagation. The DGA can be used to quickly and accurately learn kinetic parameters using gradient descent and design biochemical networks with desired properties. As an illustration, we apply the DGA to study stochastic models of gene promoters. We show that the DGA can be used to: (i) successfully learn kinetic parameters from experimental measurements of mRNA expression levels from two distinct $\textit{E. coli}$ promoters and (ii) design nonequilibrium promoter architectures with desired input-output relationships. These examples illustrate the utility of the DGA for analyzing stochastic chemical kinetics, including a wide variety of problems of interest to synthetic and systems biology.</description>
