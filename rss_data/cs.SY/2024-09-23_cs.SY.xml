      <title>Reducing transmission expansion by co-optimizing sizing of wind, solar, storage and grid connection capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding transmission capacity is likely a bottleneck that will restrict variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment required to achieve ambitious emission reduction goals. Interconnection and inter-zonal transmission buildout may be displaced by the optimal sizing of VRE to grid connection capacity and by the co-location of VRE and battery resources behind interconnection. However, neither of these capabilities is commonly captured in macro-energy system models. We develop two new functionalities to explore the substitutability of storage for transmission and the optimal capacity and siting decisions of renewable energy and battery resources through 2030 in the Western Interconnection of the United States. Our findings indicate that modeling optimized interconnection and storage co-location better captures the full value of energy storage and its ability to substitute for transmission. Optimizing interconnection capacity and co-location can reduce total grid connection and shorter-distance transmission capacity expansion on the order of 10% at storage penetration equivalent to 2.5-10% of peak system demand. The decline in interconnection capacity corresponds with greater ratios of VRE to grid connection capacity (an average of 1.5-1.6 megawatt (MW) PV:1 MW inverter capacity, 1.2-1.3 MW wind:1 MW interconnection). Co-locating storage with VREs also results in a 10-15% increase in wind capacity, as wind sites tend to require longer and more costly interconnection. Finally, co-located storage exhibits higher value than standalone storage in our model setup (22-25%). Given the coarse representation of transmission networks in our modeling, this outcome likely overstates the real-world importance of storage co-location with VREs. However, it highlights how siting storage in grid-constrained locations can maximize the value of storage and reduce transmission expansion.</description>

      <title>Informative Input Design for Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently estimating system dynamics from data is essential for minimizing data collection costs and improving model performance. This work addresses the challenge of designing future control inputs to maximize information gain, thereby improving the efficiency of the system identification process. We propose an approach that integrates informative input design into the Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) framework, which is well-suited for high-dimensional systems. By formulating an approximate convex optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the estimation error covariance matrix, we are able to efficiently reduce uncertainty in the model parameters while respecting constraints on the system states and control inputs. This method outperforms traditional techniques like Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) and orthogonal multisines, which do not adapt to the current system model and often gather redundant information. We validate our approach using aircraft and fluid dynamics simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of our method. Our results show that strategically planning control inputs based on the current model enhances the accuracy of system identification while requiring less data. Furthermore, we provide our implementation and simulation interfaces as an open-source software package, facilitating further research development and use by industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Wireless Interconnection Network (WINE) for Post-Exascale High-Performance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnection networks, or `interconnects,' play a crucial role in administering the communication among computing units of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Efficient provisioning of interconnects minimizes the processing delay wherein computing units await information sharing between each other, thereby enhancing the overall computation efficiency. Ideally, interconnects are designed with topologies tailored to match specific workflows, requiring diverse structures for different applications. However, since modifying their structures mid-operation renders impractical, indirect communication incurs across distant units. In managing numerous long-routed data deliveries, heavy burdens on the network side may lead to the under-utilization of computing resources. In view of state-of-the-art HPC paradigms that solicit dense interconnections for diverse computation-hungry applications, this article presents a versatile wireless interconnecting framework, coined as Wireless Interconnection NEtwork (WINE). The framework exploits cutting-edge wireless technologies that promote workload adaptability and scalability of modern interconnects. Design and implementation of wirelessly reliable links are strategized under network-oriented scrutiny of HPC architectures. A virtual HPC platform is developed to assess WINE's feasibilities, verifying its practicality for integration into modern HPC infrastructures.</description>

      <title>On the Connection Between Gramian-based and Interpolation-based Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gramian-based model order reduction methods, like balanced truncation, and interpolation-based methods, such as H2-optimal reduction, are two important types of model reduction algorithms. Although both are known for their accuracy, they are often seen as two different approaches. This paper shows that these two methods are closely related, with Gramian-based reduction being roughly an interpolation problem, and vice versa. For Galerkin projection, we find that when the reduced model has enough order to capture the significant eigenvalues of the controllability or observability Gramian, preserving these eigenvalues becomes an interpolation problem. In this case, both Gramian-based and interpolation-based model reduction methods produce the same transfer function but with different state-space realizations. When the reduced model's order is too small to capture all significant eigenvalues, the methods begin to differ, and the difference depends on the eigenvalues that were left out. In the case of Petrov-Galerkin projection, if the reduced model's order is large enough to capture the significant Hankel singular values, balanced truncation becomes the same as H2-optimal model order reduction. Again, both methods give the same transfer function but with different state-space realizations. When the order is smaller, the methods diverge, with the difference depending on the truncated Hankel singular values. Numerical examples are provided to support these findings, showing that Gramian-based and interpolation-based model reduction methods are more connected than previously thought and can be viewed as approximations of each other.</description>

      <title>The system dynamics analysis, resilient and fault-tolerant control for cyber-physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the detection, resilient and fault-tolerant control issues for cyber-physical systems. To this end, the impairment of system dynamics caused by the defined types of cyber-attacks and process faults is analyzed. Then, the relation of the system input and output signals with the residual subspaces spanned by both the process and the controller is studied. Considering the limit capacity of standard observer-based detection and feedback control schemes in detecting and handling the cyber-attacks, a modified configuration for cyber-physical systems is developed by transmitting the combinations of the input and output residuals instead of the input and output signals, which is facile for dealing with both the process faults and cyber-attacks. It is followed by the integrated design of fault and attack detection, resilient and fault-tolerant control schemes. To enhance the detectability of cyber-attacks, the potential stealthy attack mechanisms on deteriorating the tracking behavior and feedback control performance are developed from the attackers' point of view, and the associated detection schemes for such stealthy attacks are proposed from the defenders' point of view. A case study on the robotino system is utilized to demonstrate the proposed resilient cyber-physical configuration.</description>

      <title>Safe stabilization using generalized Lyapunov barrier function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the safe stabilization problem, focusing on controlling the system state to the origin while avoiding entry into unsafe state sets. The current methods for solving this issue rely on smooth Lyapunov and barrier functions, which do not always ensure the existence of an effective controller even when such smooth functions are created. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of a generalized (nonsmooth) Lyapunov barrier function (GenLBF), which guarantees the existence of a safe and stable controller. We outline a systematic approach for constructing a GenLBF, including a technique for efficiently calculating the upper generalized derivative of the GenLBF. Using the constructed GenLBF, we propose a method for certifying safe stabilization of autonomous systems and design a piecewise continuous feedback control to achieve safe stabilization of non-autonomous systems. A general controller refinement strategy is further proposed to help the state trajectory escape from undesired local points occurring in systems with special physical structure. A thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in addressing the safe stabilization problem for systems with single or multiple bounded unsafe state sets. Extensive simulations of linear and nonlinear systems further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method and its superiority over the smooth control Lyapunov barrier function method.</description>

      <title>An Efficient General-Purpose Optical Accelerator for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose optical accelerators (GOAs) have emerged as a promising platform to accelerate deep neural networks (DNNs) due to their low latency and energy consumption. Such an accelerator is usually composed of a given number of interleaving Mach-Zehnder- Interferometers (MZIs). This interleaving architecture, however, has a low efficiency when accelerating neural networks of various sizes due to the mismatch between weight matrices and the GOA architecture. In this work, a hybrid GOA architecture is proposed to enhance the mapping efficiency of neural networks onto the GOA. In this architecture, independent MZI modules are connected with microring resonators (MRRs), so that they can be combined to process large neural networks efficiently. Each of these modules implements a unitary matrix with inputs adjusted by tunable coefficients. The parameters of the proposed architecture are searched using genetic algorithm. To enhance the accuracy of neural networks, selected weight matrices are expanded to multiple unitary matrices applying singular value decomposition (SVD). The kernels in neural networks are also adjusted to use up the on-chip computational resources. Experimental results show that with a given number of MZIs, the mapping efficiency of neural networks on the proposed architecture can be enhanced by 21.87%, 21.20%, 24.69%, and 25.52% for VGG16 and Resnet18 on datasets Cifar10 and Cifar100, respectively. The energy consumption and computation latency can also be reduced by over 67% and 21%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Undetectable False Data Injection Attacks on Encrypted Bilateral Teleoperation System based on Dynamic Symmetry and Malleability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the vulnerability of bilateral teleoperation systems to perfectly undetectable False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Teleoperation, one of the major applications in robotics, involves a leader manipulator operated by a human and a follower manipulator at a remote site, connected via a communication channel. While this setup enables operation in challenging environments, it also introduces cybersecurity risks, particularly in the communication link. The paper focuses on a specific class of cyberattacks: perfectly undetectable FDIAs, where attackers alter signals without leaving detectable traces at all. Compared to previous research on linear and first-order nonlinear systems, this paper examines bilateral teleoperation systems with second-order nonlinear manipulator dynamics. The paper derives mathematical conditions based on Lie Group theory that enable such attacks, demonstrating how an attacker can modify the follower manipulator's motion while the operator perceives normal operation through the leader device. This vulnerability challenges conventional detection methods based on observable changes and highlights the need for advanced security measures in teleoperation systems. To validate the theoretical results, the paper presents experimental demonstrations using a teleoperation system connecting robots in the US and Japan.</description>

      <title>ERIC: Estimating Rainfall with Commodity Doorbell Camera for Precision Residential Irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art residential irrigation systems, such as WaterMyYard, rely on rainfall data from nearby weather stations to adjust irrigation amounts. However, the accuracy of rainfall data is compromised by the limited spatial resolution of rain gauges and the significant variability of hyperlocal rainfall, leading to substantial water waste. To improve irrigation efficiency, we developed a cost-effective irrigation system, dubbed ERIC, which employs machine learning models to estimate rainfall from commodity doorbell camera footage and optimizes irrigation schedules without human intervention. Specifically, we: a) designed novel visual and audio features with lightweight neural network models to infer rainfall from the camera at the edge, preserving user privacy; b) built a complete end-to-end irrigation system on Raspberry Pi 4, costing only $75. We deployed the system across five locations (collecting over 750 hours of video) with varying backgrounds and light conditions. Comprehensive evaluation validates that ERIC achieves state-of-the-art rainfall estimation performance (~ 5mm/day), saving 9,112 gallons/month of water, translating to $28.56/month in utility savings.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Driving at Unsignalized Intersections: A Review of Decision-Making Challenges and Reinforcement Learning-Based Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving at unsignalized intersections is still considered a challenging application for machine learning due to the complications associated with handling complex multi-agent scenarios characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. Automating the decision-making process at these safety-critical environments involves comprehending multiple levels of abstractions associated with learning robust driving behaviors to enable the vehicle to navigate efficiently. In this survey, we aim at exploring the state-of-the-art techniques implemented for decision-making applications, with a focus on algorithms that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and deep learning for learning traversing policies at unsignalized intersections. The reviewed schemes vary in the proposed driving scenario, in the assumptions made for the used intersection model, in the tackled challenges, and in the learning algorithms that are used. We have presented comparisons for these techniques to highlight their limitations and strengths. Based on our in-depth investigation, it can be discerned that a robust decision-making scheme for navigating real-world unsignalized intersection has yet to be developed. Along with our analysis and discussion, we recommend potential research directions encouraging the interested players to tackle the highlighted challenges. By adhering to our recommendations, decision-making architectures that are both non-overcautious and safe, yet feasible, can be trained and validated in real-world unsignalized intersections environments.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Reach-Avoid for Black-Box Systems through Narrow Gaps via Neural Network Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classical reach-avoid problem, autonomous mobile robots are tasked to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. However, it is difficult to provide guarantees on the robot's performance when the obstacles form a narrow gap and the robot is a black-box (i.e. the dynamics are not known analytically, but interacting with the system is cheap). To address this challenge, this paper presents NeuralPARC. The method extends the authors' prior Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to systems modeled by rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks, which are trained to represent parameterized trajectory data demonstrated by the robot. NeuralPARC computes the reachable set of the network while accounting for modeling error, and returns a set of states and parameters with which the black-box system is guaranteed to reach the goal and avoid obstacles. Through numerical experiments, NeuralPARC is shown to outperform PARC in generating provably-safe extreme vehicle drift parking maneuvers, as well as enabling safety on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subjected to large disturbances and controlled by a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy.</description>

Abstract: Cooperative control of multi-UAV systems has attracted substantial research attention due to its significance in various application sectors such as emergency response, search and rescue missions, and critical infrastructure inspection. This paper proposes a distributed control algorithm to generate collision-free trajectories that drive the multi-UAV system to completely inspect a set of 3D points on the surface of an object of interest. The objective of the UAVs is to cooperatively inspect the object of interest in the minimum amount of time. Extensive numerical simulations for a team of quadrotor UAVs inspecting a real 3D structure illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control For Multiple Castaway Tracking with an Autonomous Aerial Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, a plethora of advancements in Unmanned Areal Vehicle (UAV) technology has paved the way for UAV-based search and rescue operations with transformative impact to the outcome of critical life-saving missions. This paper dives into the challenging task of multiple castaway tracking using an autonomous UAV agent. Leveraging on the computing power of the modern embedded devices, we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for tracking multiple castaways assumed to drift afloat in the aftermath of a maritime accident. We consider a stationary radar sensor that is responsible for signaling the search mission by providing noisy measurements of each castaway's initial state. The UAV agent aims at detecting and tracking the moving targets with its equipped onboard camera sensor that has limited sensing range. In this work, we also experimentally determine the probability of target detection from real-world data by training and evaluating various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Cooperative distributed model predictive control for embedded systems: Experiments with hovercraft formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents experiments for embedded cooperative distributed model predictive control applied to a team of hovercraft floating on an air hockey table. The hovercraft collectively solve a centralized optimal control problem in each sampling step via a stabilizing decentralized real-time iteration scheme using the alternating direction method of multipliers. The efficient implementation does not require a central coordinator, executes onboard the hovercraft, and facilitates sampling intervals in the millisecond range. The formation control experiments showcase the flexibility of the approach on scenarios with point-to-point transitions, trajectory tracking, collision avoidance, and moving obstacles.</description>

      <title>State space models, emergence, and ergodicity: How many parameters are needed for stable predictions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many parameters are required for a model to execute a given task? It has been argued that large language models, pre-trained via self-supervised learning, exhibit emergent capabilities such as multi-step reasoning as their number of parameters reach a critical scale. In the present work, we explore whether this phenomenon can analogously be replicated in a simple theoretical model. We show that the problem of learning linear dynamical systems -- a simple instance of self-supervised learning -- exhibits a corresponding phase transition. Namely, for every non-ergodic linear system there exists a critical threshold such that a learner using fewer parameters than said threshold cannot achieve bounded error for large sequence lengths. Put differently, in our model we find that tasks exhibiting substantial long-range correlation require a certain critical number of parameters -- a phenomenon akin to emergence. We also investigate the role of the learner's parametrization and consider a simple version of a linear dynamical system with hidden state -- an imperfectly observed random walk in $\mathbb{R}$. For this situation, we show that there exists no learner using a linear filter which can succesfully learn the random walk unless the filter length exceeds a certain threshold depending on the effective memory length and horizon of the problem.</description>

      <title>A Cyberattack Detection-Isolation Scheme For CAV Under Changing Driving Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under a changing driving environment, a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon relies strongly on the acquisition of accurate traffic information from neighboring vehicles as well as reliable commands from a centralized supervisory controller through the communication network. Even though such modalities are imperative to ensure the safe and efficient driving performance of CAVs, they led to multiple security challenges. Thus, a cyberattack on this network can corrupt vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, which can lead to unsafe or undesired driving scenarios. Hence, in this paper, we propose a cyberattack detection-isolation algorithm comprised of a unified V2V and V2I cyberattack detection scheme along with a V2I isolation scheme for CAVs under changing driving conditions. The proposed algorithm is constructed using a bank of residual generators with Lyapunov function-based performance guarantees, such as disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of our proposed algorithm through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations using real-world highway and urban driving data. The results show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the cybersecurity of CAVs by detecting cyberattacks on CAV platoons and isolating infrastructure-level traffic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Versatile Quadrupedal Gait Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries of dynamic legged systems. We propose a symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries, streamlining gait design, accelerating learning, and enhancing robot agility. By focusing on preserved symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for predefined trajectories or footfall sequences, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented on the Petoi Bittle robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.</description>

      <title>Expectation Maximization Aided Modified Weighted Sequential Energy Detector for Distributed Cooperative Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy detector (ED) is a popular choice for distributed cooperative spectrum sensing because it does not need to be cognizant of the primary user (PU) signal characteristics. However, the conventional ED-based sensing usually requires large number of observed samples per energy statistic, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), for improved detection capability. This is due to the fact that it uses the energy only from the present sensing interval for the PU detection. Previous studies have shown that even with fewer observed samples per energy statistics, improved detection capabilities can be achieved by aggregating both present and past ED samples in a test statistic. Thus, a weighted sequential energy detector (WSED) has been proposed, but it is based on aggregating all the collected ED samples over an observation window. For a highly dynamic PU over the consecutive sensing intervals, that involves also combining the outdated samples in the test statistic that do not correspond to the present state of the PU. In this paper, we propose a modified WSED (mWSED) that uses the primary user states information over the window to aggregate only the highly correlated ED samples in its test statistic. In practice, since the PU states are a priori unknown, we also develop a joint expectation-maximization and Viterbi (EM-Viterbi) algorithm based scheme to iteratively estimate the states by using the ED samples collected over the window. The estimated states are then used in mWSED to compute its test statistics, and the algorithm is referred to here as the EM-mWSED algorithm. Simulation results show that EM-mWSED outperforms other schemes and its performance improves by increasing the average number of neighbors per SU in the network, and by increasing the SNR or the number of samples per energy statistic.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes fixed competition that is manifested through a constant weight that each agent gives to its initial opinion in addition to its contribution through a consensus dynamic. This letter investigates the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We show that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We evaluate this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. If competition is not uniform across clients, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate and validate our analytical insights numerically.</description>

      <title>Optimal and $H_\infty$ Control of Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks is a powerful class of models for the representation a wide variety of population models including biochemistry. The control of such networks has been recently considered due to their important implications for the control of biological systems. Their optimal control, however, has been relatively few studied until now. The continuous-time finite-horizon optimal control problem is formulated first and explicitly solved in the case of unimolecular reaction networks. The problems of the optimal sampled-data control, the continuous $H_\infty$ control, and the sampled-data $H_\infty$ control of such networks are addressed next. The results in the unimolecular case take the form of nonstandard Riccati differential equations or differential Lyapunov equations coupled with difference Riccati equations, which can all be solved numerically by backward-in-time integration.</description>

Abstract: Ocean dynamics play a crucial role in global climate, ecosystems, and human activities, necessitating accurate and efficient methods to characterize ocean currents and waves. This paper presents the development of a novel bio-inspired hydrofoil system for detecting and characterizing ocean currents and waves based on a dolphin's flipper foil design. The prototype's performance was assessed through controlled experiments, demonstrating the system's ability to quickly and accurately orientate itself in the direction of flow. Wave mechanics and a geometric proof were applied to estimate wave parameters such as wave height and current from the hydrofoil's positioning. The proposed hydrofoil system shows potential for use in various marine applications, including oceanographic research, environmental monitoring, and navigation. The bio-inspired hydrofoil system offers a promising approach to ocean current and wave characterization, with the potential to significantly impact our understanding and monitoring of ocean dynamics without greatly impacting vehicle performance or increasing power utilization in operation.</description>

Abstract: Interpolatory necessary optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of unstructured linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are well-known. Based on previous work on $\mathcal{L}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of stationary parametric problems, in this paper we develop and investigate optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of structured LTI systems, in particular, for second-order, port-Hamiltonian, and time-delay systems. Under certain diagonalizability assumptions, we show that across all these different structured settings, bitangential Hermite interpolation is the common form for optimality, thus proving a unifying optimality framework for structured reduced-order modeling.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Secure Software Development: the Role of Voluntary Audit and Liability Waiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misaligned incentives in secure software development have long been the focus of research in the economics of security. Product liability, a powerful legal framework in other industries, has been largely ineffective for software products until recent times. However, the rapid regulatory responses to recent global cyber attacks by both the United States and the European Union, together with the (relative) success of the General Data Protection Regulation in defining both duty and standard of care for software vendors, may enable regulators to use liability to re-align incentives for the benefit of the digital society. Specifically, the recent United States National Cybersecurity Strategy suggests shifting responsibility for cyber incidents back to software vendors. In doing so, the strategy also puts forward the concept of the liability waiver: if a software company voluntarily undergoes and passes an IT security audit, its future product liability is (fully or partially) waived.
  In this paper, we analyze this audit scenario from the perspective of the software vendor and the auditor, respectively. From the vendor's view, this is formulated as a sequential decision problem: a vendor with a product or process needs to pass a mandatory audit to release the product onto the market; it is allowed to go through the audit repeatedly, and thus the vendor needs to determine what level of effort to put into the product following each failed test. We show that the optimal strategy for an opt-in vendor is to never quit and to exert cumulative investments in either a ``one-and-done'' or ``incremental'' manner. From the auditor's view, we examine what type of audit might be the most effective in incentivizing voluntary participation and, at the same time, a more desirable effort from the vendor. We also showed how dynamic audits can be exploited to increase the vendor's incentivizable investment.</description>

      <title>Exact Imposition of Safety Boundary Conditions in Neural Reachable Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a widely adopted verification tool to provide safety and performance guarantees for autonomous systems. However, it involves solving a partial differential equation (PDE) to compute a safety value function, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with the state dimension, making its direct application to large-scale systems intractable. To overcome these challenges, DeepReach, a recently proposed learning-based approach, approximates high-dimensional reachable tubes using neural networks (NNs). While shown to be effective, the accuracy of the learned solution decreases with system complexity. One of the reasons for this degradation is a soft imposition of safety constraints during the learning process, which corresponds to the boundary conditions of the PDE, resulting in inaccurate value functions. In this work, we propose ExactBC, a variant of DeepReach that imposes safety constraints exactly during the learning process by restructuring the overall value function as a weighted sum of the boundary condition and the NN output. Moreover, the proposed variant no longer needs a boundary loss term during the training process, thus eliminating the need to balance different loss terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in significantly improving the accuracy of the learned value function for four challenging reachability tasks: a rimless wheel system with state resets, collision avoidance in a cluttered environment, autonomous rocket landing, and multi-aircraft collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shield Synthesis via State-Space Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing safety strategies for control systems, also known as shields. Since the state space is infinite, shields are typically computed over a finite-state abstraction, with the most common abstraction being a rectangular grid. However, for many systems, such a grid does not align well with the safety property or the system dynamics. That is why a coarse grid is rarely sufficient, but a fine grid is typically computationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we show that appropriate state-space transformations can still allow to use a coarse grid at almost no computational overhead. We demonstrate in three case studies that our transformation-based synthesis outperforms a standard synthesis by several orders of magnitude. In the first two case studies, we use domain knowledge to select a suitable transformation. In the third case study, we instead report on results in engineering a transformation without domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Data-driven distributionally robust MPC for systems with multiplicative noise: A semi-infinite semi-definite programming approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) algorithm for a specific class of controlled dynamical systems where the disturbance multiplies the state and control variables. These classes of systems arise in mathematical finance, where the paradigm of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) fits perfectly, and this serves as the primary motivation for this work. We recast the optimal control problem (OCP) as a semi-definite program with an infinite number of constraints, making the ensuing optimization problem a \emph{semi-infinite semi-definite program} (SI-SDP). To numerically solve the SI-SDP, we advance an approach for solving convex semi-infinite programs (SIPs) to SI-SDPs and, subsequently, solve the DRMPC problem. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>
