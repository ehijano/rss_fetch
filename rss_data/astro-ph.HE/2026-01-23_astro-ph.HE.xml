      <title>Dynamic shocks powered by a wide, relativistic, super-Eddington outflow launched by an accreting neutron star in the mid-20th century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting systems can launch powerful outflows which interact with the surrounding medium. We combine new radio observations of the accreting neutron star X-ray binary (XRB) Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) with archival radio observations going back 24 years. The $\sim3$ pc scale wide-angle radio and X-ray emitting caps found around Cir X-1 are identified as synchrotron emitting shocks with significant proper motion and morphological evolution on decade timescales. Proper motion measurements of the shocks reveal they are mildly relativistic and decelerating, with apparent velocity of $0.14c\pm0.03c$ at a propagation distance of 2 pc. We demonstrate that these shocks are likely powered by a hidden relativistic ($\gtrsim0.3c$) wide-angle conical outflow launched in $1972\pm3$, in stark contrast to known structures around other XRBs formed by collimated jets over 1000s of years. The minimum time-averaged power of the outflow required to produce the observed synchrotron emission is $\sim0.1L_\text{Edd}$, while the time-averaged power required for the kinetic energy of the shocks is $\sim40 \left(\frac{n}{10^{-2} \text{cm}^{-3}}\right)L_\text{Edd}$, where $n$ is the average ambient medium number density. This reveals the outflow powering the shocks is likely significantly super-Eddington. We measure significant linear polarisation up to $52\pm6\%$ in the shocks demonstrating the presence of an ordered magnetic field of strength $\sim200~\mu\text{G}$. We show that the shocks are potential PeVatrons, capable of accelerating electrons to $\sim0.7~\text{PeV}$ and protons to $\sim20~\text{PeV}$, and we estimate the injection and energetic efficiencies of electron acceleration in the shocks. Finally, we predict that next generation gamma-ray facilities may be able to detect hadronic signatures from the shocks.</description>

      <title>Spin-down changes in PSR B0540-69 induced by a drift of the magnetic axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the solid crust + magnetic field lines of pulsars is a much debated issue, and remains unsettled after 50 years. Some pieces of evidence have emerged to complete and confirm theoretical calculations and expectations. We discuss in the present work an interpretation of the behavior of the ''Crab Twin'' pulsar PSR B0540-69 in terms of the evolution of the magnetic field/quakes, connecting the behavior of the braking index with the underlying platelet drift and sudden discontinuous rearrangement (fast-slip) and long-term ones (slow-slip events), suggested by analogy with existing theoretical picture observed in the Earth's crust. The relationship of this scenario with permanent torque-changing glitches seen in the Crab and other young pulsars, and a set of similar events in the same object and others is addressed. We conclude that this physical approach is in principle consistent with all these sudden events, and point out future work to clarify the whole picture.</description>

      <title>The long quest for vacuum birefringence in magnetars: 1E 1547.0-5408 and the elusive smoking gun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are now known to be among the most strongly polarized celestial sources in X-rays. Here we report on the $500\,\mathrm{ks}$ observation of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025. The IXPE spectrum is well reproduced by a single thermal component with blackbody temperature $kT_\mathrm{BB}\sim 0.67\,\mathrm{keV}$ and emission radius $R_\mathrm{BB}\sim 1.2\,\mathrm{km}$. The source exhibits a high linear polarization degree in the $2$--$6\,\mathrm{keV}$ band ($\mathrm{PD}=47.7\pm2.9\%$) with polarization angle $\mathrm{PA}=75^\circ.8 \pm 1.^\circ8$, measured West of celestial North. While $\mathrm{PA}$ does not appear to vary with energy, there is some evidence (at the $1\sigma$ confidence level) of a minimum in $\mathrm{PD}$ between $3$ and $4\,\mathrm{keV}$, compatible with what is expected by partial mode conversion at the vacuum resonance in a magnetized atmosphere. Phase-resolved spectral and polarimetric analyses reveal that X-ray thermal radiation likely originates from a single, fairly small hot spot with a non-uniform temperature distribution. Fitting the phase-dependent $\mathrm{PA}$ measured by IXPE with a rotating vector model (RVM) constrains the source geometry and indicates that both the dipole axis and line-of-sight are misaligned with respect to the spin axis. Under these conditions, the high polarization of the source cannot be regarded as compelling evidence for the presence of vacuum birefringence in the star magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the fact that the RVM successfully reproduces the modulation of the X-ray polarization angle and the behavior of $\mathrm{PD}$ with the energy hint once more to the presence of QED effects in magnetars.</description>

      <title>Source identification for the Swift-BAT 150-month hard X-ray catalog using soft X-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive catalog of 251 potential counterparts for 250 unassociated hard X-ray sources detected in the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 150-month hard X-ray survey. Over 150 months of observation, BAT has detected 2339 sources in the 15-150 keV energy range. Among these, 344 do not have a previously identified low-energy counterpart. Our study focuses on the analysis of soft X-ray observations at energies below 10 keV, spatially overlapping with these new Swift-BAT hard X-ray sources. Such observations were taken with Chandra, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, and XMM-Newton. Within the sample of 251 potential counterparts, 94 (37 percent) are identified as active galactic nuclei and 58 (23 percent) as galaxies. The remaining 99 sources (40 percent) include pulsars, cataclysmic variables, and unclassified soft X-ray counterparts in the 0.5-10 keV band. Redshift information is available for 139 out of the 251 sources, and its distribution is in close agreement with the redshift distribution of previous BAT catalogs. We also present the results of a small optical spectroscopy campaign of 9 out of 58 galaxies. The majority of these are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies at redshifts slightly larger than the median of the BAT AGN sample.</description>

      <title>The initial spin matters: the impact of rapid rotation on magnetic-field amplification at merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A couple of milliseconds after the merger of a binary system of neutron stars can play a fundamental role in amplifying the comparatively low initial magnetic fields into magnetar strengths. The basic mechanism responsible for this amplification is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and we here report the first systematic study of the impact of rapid rotation on the KHI-amplification process exploiting general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations at very high-resolutions of $35\,{\rm m}$. Concentrating on four different spinning configurations, we find that aligned, anti-aligned, and mixed (aligned/anti-aligned) spin configurations lead to markedly different growth rates of the electromagnetic (EM) energy, field topologies, and vortex properties when compared to the irrotational case. These differences arise from intrinsic variations in the system dynamics, such as tidal deformation, collision strength, and contact surface area, with the anti-aligned configuration producing the largest vorticity and growth in EM energy. Importantly, while different spin configurations lead to significantly different initial growth rates of the poloidal/toroidal components, all systems converge to a specific topological partition. Our simulations are confined to a short window in time, but the different EM energies produced as a result of spin will imprint the EM emission at merger and provide information on the spinning state at merger.</description>

      <title>Development of an early warning method incorporating pre-supernova neutrino light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars ($M&gt;8\mathrm{M_\odot}$) emit neutrinos known as pre-supernova (pre-SN) neutrinos through thermal and nuclear interactions for cooling the stellar core during the final stage of stellar evolution. Real-time monitoring of their pre-SN neutrino interaction rate offers a crucial opportunity to issue an early warning to a core-collapse supernova. Some neutrino detectors, including KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande already operate pre-SN alarm systems based on a statistically significant excess of the observed event rate over the expected background. To improve alarm sensitivity, we propose an alarm method which incorporates the time evolution of the observed pre-SN neutrino event rate. The method uses a log likelihood ratio test that references multiple theoretical stellar-evolution models and treats the core collapse time as a nuisance parameter to be profiled over. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using simulated data for the KamLAND, Super-Kamiokande with dissolved Gadolinium (SK-Gd) and their combined analysis. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the warning time compared to the conventional rate-only method, while maintaining the same false alarm rate.</description>

      <title>GRB~250704B/EP250704a a Short Gamma-Ray Burst Powered by a Magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB~250704B/EP250704a, identified as a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), exhibited prolonged X-ray emission following the prompt phase and, in optical and infrared (IR) bands, an unusual one-day plateau succeeded by a rapid decline. This sGRB was observed by multiple satellites and ground-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum. This study presents temporal and spectral analyses from radio to gamma-ray frequencies, spanning several observation periods beginning after the trigger and continuing for nearly 2 days. The results of the temporal and spectral analyses of the prompt episode, the extended X-ray component, and the afterglow phase are consistent with a millisecond magnetar undergoing accretion. The long-lasting X-ray emission is attributed to the internal energy dissipation of the magnetar spin-down power, governed by the magnetization parameter; the extended optical/IR plateau to synchrotron afterglow emission with energy injection; and the steep decay to changes in microphysical parameters during the post-jet break phase. The X-ray observations are consistent with the superposition of spin-down luminosity and synchrotron afterglow scenario. These findings suggest that the compact-object remnant is most likely a long-lived magnetar.</description>

      <title>SVOM discovery of a strong X-ray outburst of the blazar 1ES~1959+650 and multi-wavelength follow-up with the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On December 6, 2024, 1ES 1959+650, one of the X-ray brightest blazars known, underwent a high-amplitude X-ray outburst detected by SVOM, the first such discovery with this mission. The source was subsequently monitored with SVOM and Swift from December 2024 to March 2025. We report the detection and multi-wavelength follow-up of this event, and describe the temporal and spectral evolution observed during the campaign. Data from SVOM/MXT, SVOM/ECLAIRs, and Swift/XRT were analyzed with log-parabola models to track flux and spectral variability. The source was detected in a bright state over the 0.3-50 keV range. During the three months of monitoring, the X-ray flux varied significantly, showing episodes of spectral hardening at high flux levels. The spectral curvature evolved more irregularly and did not show a clear trend with flux. A shift of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) synchrotron peak to higher energies is seen when the flux increases. This constitutes the first blazar outburst discovered in X-rays by SVOM. The coordinated follow-up with Swift provided continuous coverage of the flare and highlights the strong complementarity of the two missions for time-domain studies of blazars. The flare shows no clear signatures of either Fermi I or Fermi II acceleration, suggesting a mixed Fermi I/II scenario.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Spectral Morphological Division of Fast Radio Bursts with CHIME/FRB Catalog 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>Magnetar fraction in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($&lt;$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($&lt;$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the recent high-accretion state of the recurrent nova T CrB: HST, Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) approaches its next predicted thermonuclear eruption, it is currently exhibiting a "super-active state" (SAS) characterized by enhanced multiwavelength emission similar to the behavior recorded prior to the 1946 outburst. We present a multiwavelength analysis of the SAS and the subsequent "faint state" using observations from HST, Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton. Our results indicate that the SAS was driven by an increase in the mass accretion rate, which caused the accretion disk's boundary layer to become optically thick. A weighted least squares regression analysis quantifies the evolution of the accretion components, displaying a highly significant (4.5$\sigma$) increase in the luminosity of the optically thin cooling flow (L$_{cf}$) and a marginal (2.58$\sigma$) decrease in the optically thick boundary layer luminosity (L$_{bb}$) as the system transitioned into the faint state. We find that this dimming is consistent with an intrinsic change in the accretion flow rather than dust obscuration, supported by the lack of infrared excess and the stability of the 2175 \AA\ feature. Additionally, a time-series analysis using autoregressive modeling to account for correlated red noise revealed no significant periodicities, thereby disputing the previously reported $\sim$6000 s signal. These findings suggest that the pre-outburst evolution of T CrB is characterized by significant changes in the accretion disk structure and boundary layer, providing a self-consistent physical framework for the system's behavior as it approaches eruption.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origin of (469219) Kamo`oalewa of Tianwen-2 Mission from the Main-Belt: $\nu_6$ Secular Resonance, Flora Family or 3:1 Resonance with Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: China's Tianwen-2 mission, launched on 29 May 2025, targets the near-Earth object (469219) Kamo`oalewa, an Earth quasi-satellite trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with our planet. Determining the origin of Kamo`oalewa is central to understanding the formation pathways and dynamical evolution of Earth's quasi-satellite population. Here we show a strong possibility of main-belt origin for Kamo`oalewa using long-term dynamical simulations. We examine three candidate source regions: the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\nu_6$), the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter (3:1J MMR), and the Flora family. A total of 42,825 test particles were integrated over 100 Myr. We find that asteroids from all three regions can be transported onto Kamo`oalewa-like orbits, albeit with markedly different efficiencies. Particles originating near the $\nu_6$ show the highest transfer probability (3.31%), followed by the Flora family (2.54%) and the 3:1J MMR (0.39%). We further identify representative dynamical pathways linking these source regions to Earth quasi-satellite orbits. The Tianwen-2 spacecraft is expected to rendezvous with Kamo`oalewa in 2026, performing close-proximity operations and returning samples. The mission will provide decisive observational constraints on the asteroid's composition and physical properties, offering a critical test of its proposed origin.</description>

      <title>Single-wave solutions of the neutrino fast flavor system. Part I. Mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dense neutrino plasma can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by neutrino--neutrino refraction. Recently, a new class of exact nonlinear inhomogeneous solutions was discovered: single-wave (SW) solutions of the fast flavor system. The key property is that the flavor occupation numbers remain homogeneous, whereas the field of flavor coherence varies spatially with a single wave vector. The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Optical Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in AGN Light Curves: Fourier versus Bayesian Periodicity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations predict that supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) will exhibit periodic brightness variations that may exceed the stochastic variability intrinsic to active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this paper, we simulate SMBHBs with damped random walk (DRW) AGN variability and an added sinusoidal signal from the orbital motion, and test three methods -- the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram (GLSP), the nested Bayesian sampler (NBS), and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ) -- to determine which is best at recovering the periodicity. Our simulated light curves follow the properties of the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to best inform current and future SMBHB searches. We map a broad range of parameter space and identify which DRW-only light curves best mimic periodicity and pass each method's model selection. The NBS performs best at detecting periodicity and filtering out DRW-only light curves. Combined candidate selection with both the NBS and GLSP significantly reduces false positive rates with marginal impact to true positive rates. With this joint model selection pipeline, we find the lowest false positive rates in ZTF-like simulations and the highest detection rates in LSST-like simulations. Using a modified computation of the False Alarm Probability (FAP) with GLSP, we efficiently triage LSST AGN light curves (~10^7 light curves in ~10-30 hours) and achieve true- and false- positive rates of ~40% and ~0.5%, respectively.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of 5-year Simultaneous X-ray and Radio Light Curves of the Dwarf Seyfert Galaxy UGC 6728</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present serendipitous simultaneous radio and X-ray light curves of the dwarf Seyfert galaxy UGC 6728 spanning 5 years. The X-ray light curve exhibits a flaring period, followed by a gradual rise and decline. Throughout these events, the X-ray hardness ratio and spectrum do not change significantly. The radio flux is constant, as far as can be determined from its sparse sampling, until the end of the X-ray flare, then decreases by a factor of two by the midpoint of the gradual X-ray rise before returning to baseline at the end of the X-ray decline. We interpret this behavior in light of a similar event recently reported in NGC 2992, in which there is a temporary obscuration of the radio source by a blob of plasma ejected by a magnetic reconnection in the accretion disk. The energetics of the X-ray flare are consistent with those expected from magnetic disk activity. As in NGC 2992, the X-ray spectrum does not evolve during the obscuration event. We also discuss the possibility that the observed phenomena are due to normal AGN coronal flaring and variability, which is plausible but unlikely given the lack of spectral variation.</description>

      <title>Compact Stars Sourced by Dark Matter Halos and Their Frozen States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -\rho$ condition between radial pressure and density. We demonstrate that while RBHs are a unique special case, a broader class of relations yields horizonless compact stars. Under specific parameter limits, these objects approach a ``frozen state," mimicking black hole features without an event horizon. These compact star solutions could satisfy weak energy conditions and provide a robust mechanism for dark matter-sourced black hole mimickers.</description>

      <title>Supernova interactions with aspherical circumstellar material I: calculations of light curves, AB magnitudes, spectra, and polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an upgraded detailed numerical calculations of supernova (SN) interactions with significantly aspherical circumstellar matter (CSM), primarily formed as a disc or bipolar lobes. The circumstellar disc can arise as a result of, for example, mass transfer in a binary, while bipolar lobes can be the result of a violent pre-explosive ejection of matter, similar to the iconic cases of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs). We numerically simulate the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) behaviour of interaction processes using a 2D cylindrical version of the RHD code CASTRO. We then calculate light curves, spectral patterns, and polarisation profiles, all up to a relatively long time of two years after an SN shock breakout and from different directions, using the multidimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MC-RT) codes SEDONA and SIROCCO. We calculated a total of five models for the two aforementioned configurations of the surrounding CSM, for stratified density levels, comparing the simulated hydrodynamic behaviour and differences in their observable properties. RHD models exhibit similar behaviour to previous adiabatic models, but with a significantly slower expansion velocity. The calculated light curves show a relatively smooth evolution in SN-disc interaction, and declines and brightening in SN-lobes interaction. Comparing models with real events with a presumed similar physical process provides guidance for selecting a more accurate CSM configuration when simulating real situations.</description>

      <title>Interaction between the ejecta, the accretion disk, and the secondary star in the recurrent nova system U Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most efforts in the modeling of recurrent novae have centered on the initial phases of the explosion and ejection, overlooking the subsequent interaction of the ejecta, first with the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf and ultimately with the secondary star. To address this gap, a series of 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations was conducted. These simulations explored the dynamic interactions between the nova ejecta, accretion disk, and stellar companion within the framework of the recurrent nova system U Sco. Notably, the simulations incorporate rotation around the system's center of mass. The primary goal of these simulations was to qualitatively examine the impact of various model parameters, including ejecta mass, velocity, and density, as well as the mass and geometry of the accretion disk. Simulations reveal complete disruption and sweeping of the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf star for models with flared disks and Mejecta/Mdisk larger than 1. In contrast, V-shaped disks with a (constant) high initial density and Mejecta/Mdisk &lt; 1 partially survive the impact with the nova ejecta. A very minor chemical contamination of the secondary star is anticipated in the U Sco case based on the limited impact of nova ejecta particles on the subgiant in all simulations. Minor mass ejection from the subgiant's outer layers is observed during the late-stage collision with ejecta and disk material, with some particles ejected from the binary system and some accreted by the white dwarf.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear astrophysics aims at unraveling the cosmic origins of chemical elements and the physical processes powering stars. It constitutes a truly multidisciplinary field, that integrates tools, advancements, and accomplishments from theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry, and theoretical and experimental atomic and nuclear physics. For instance, the advent of high-energy astrophysics, facilitated by space-borne observatories, has ushered in a new era, offering a unique, panchromatic view of the universe (i.e., allowing multifrequency observations of stellar events); supercomputers are also playing a pivotal role, furnishing astrophysicists with computational capabilities essential for studying the intricate evolution of stars within a multidimensional framework; cosmochemists, through examination of primitive meteorites, are uncovering tiny fragments of stardust, shedding light on the physical processes operating in stars and on the mechanisms that govern condensation of stellar ejecta into solids; simultaneously, nuclear physicists managed to measure nuclear reactions at (or close to) stellar energies, using both stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. This paper provides a multidisciplinary view on nucleosynthesis accompanying stellar explosions, with a specific focus on thermonuclear supernovae, classical novae, and type I X-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Induced Polarization Rotation in Active Galactic Nuclei Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parity-violating birefringence induced by an asymmetric neutrino background in plasmas associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We derive a directionality factor arising from the relative bulk motion between the neutrino medium and plasma, and show that it can produce an anomalous frequency dependence of the polarization-rotation angle, distinct from the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling of Faraday rotation. This anomalous scaling can occur either at the resonance plasma frequency condition $\omega \simeq \omega_p$, or when $E_\nu^{0}\simeq m_\nu \omega/\omega_p$ lies within the range of the neutrino energy spectrum. We estimate the effect for three scenarios: jets propagating through the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), jets with an internal flux of high-energy neutrinos, and accretion-disk plasma permeated by the C$\nu$B. Of the three scenarios, the latter gives the largest rotation angle $\phi_{\rm d} \sim 10^{-35}\,\mathrm{rad}$, at X-ray frequencies. Although the predicted rotation angles are below current polarimetric sensitivity, the identified spectral signatures provide a theoretical framework for probing neutrino asymmetries and AGN plasma properties independent of magnetic field models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact astrophysical systems such as neutron stars and black holes provide powerful laboratories for testing feebly coupled dark photons (DPs). We investigate light DPs kinetically mixed with the visible photon that need not be the dark matter, focusing on resonant photon-DP oscillations in magnetized, modeled plasma environments. We show that realistic non-monotonic plasma density profiles generically enhance resonant conversion relative to monotonic models, leading to substantially stronger constraints on the photon-DP kinetic mixing parameter ($\epsilon$). Using spectral data from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87*, extending to the LOFAR band, we derive a bound $\epsilon \simeq 7\times10^{-6}$ at the DP mass $m_{A'} \simeq 5\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation distance $3r_{\rm ph}$, where $r_{\rm ph}$ denotes the photon sphere radius. From the Crab pulsar-wind Nebula, we obtain an even stronger constraint, $\epsilon \simeq 8\times10^{-7}$ at $m_{A'} \simeq 4\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation baselines of order $10^{3}\,\mathrm{km}$, surpassing existing astrophysical limits in realistic plasma backgrounds. While laboratory and cosmological bounds remain slightly stronger at comparable masses, observation of compact objects with larger surface magnetic fields and measurements of photon spectra at lower frequencies would enhance the limits on the photon-DP coupling by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Formation and X-ray emission from hot bubbles in planetary nebulae - III. The impact of [Wolf-Rayet]-type winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and synthetic X-ray emission of hot bubbles within planetary nebulae (PNe) driven by the powerful winds of H-deficient, [Wolf-Rayet]([WR])-type stars. Our models, based on {\sc mesa} stellar evolution tracks for 1--3 M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, adopt a recent mass-loss rate prescription for [WR] stars and incorporate the enhanced radiative cooling of their C-rich material, comparing the results against standard H-rich PN models. The enhanced mass-loss in the [WR] models leads to an accelerated post-AGB evolution and a subsequent delay in hot bubble formation compared to their H-rich counterparts, as suggested by a previous work. By computing synthetic X-ray spectra that account for the mixed H-rich and H-deficient gas phases, we find that models incorporating [WR] winds exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities ($L_\mathrm{X}$) than their H-rich counterparts, but the emissivity-weighted plasma temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas converge to values of $T_\mathrm{X} = [1-3] \times 10^{6}$~K, regardless of whether the system follows a [WR]-type or an H-rich post-AGB evolutionary path. Our results reinforce previous suggestions that mixing is a key mechanism in generating the observed soft X-ray emission even for PN hosting [WR] central stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for GeV emission of the superluminous supernova SN 2017egm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a new class of transients with luminosities $\sim10 -100$ times larger than the usual core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Their origin is still unclear and one widely discussed scenario involves a millisecond magnetar central engine. The GeV-TeV emission of SLSNe has been predicted in the literature but has not been convincingly detected yet. Here we report the results of the search for $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of SN 2017egm, one of the closest SLSNe detected so far, using 15 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT Pass 8 data. There is a transient $\gamma$-ray source appearing about 2 months after this event and lasting a few months. Monte Carlo simulations show that the $\gamma$-ray signal has a global significance of {\it at least} 4$\sigma$. Both the peak time and the luminosity of the GeV emission are consistent with the magnetar model prediction, suggesting that such a GeV transient is the high-energy counterpart of SN 2017egm and the central engine of this SLSNe is a young magnetar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present near-infrared follow-up observations of the International Gravitational Wave Network (IGWN) event S250206dm with the Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER). WINTER is a near-infrared time-domain survey designed for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational-wave sources localized to $\leq$300 deg$^{2}$. The instrument's wide field of view (1.2 deg$^2$), dedicated 1-m robotic telescope, and near-infrared coverage (0.9-1.7 microns) are optimized for searching for kilonovae, which are expected to exhibit a relatively long-lived near-infrared component. S250206dm is the only neutron star merger in the fourth observing run (to date) localized to $\leq$300 deg$^{2}$ with a False Alarm Rate below one per year. It has a $55\%$ probability of being a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger and a $37\%$ probability of being a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, with a $50\%$ credible region spanning 38 deg$^2$, an estimated distance of 373 Mpc, and an overall false alarm rate of approximately one in 25 years. WINTER covered $43\%$ of the probability area at least once and $35\%$ at least three times. Through automated and human candidate vetting, all transient candidates found in WINTER coverage were rejected as kilonova candidates. Unsurprisingly, given the large estimated distance of 373 Mpc, the WINTER upper limits do not constrain kilonova models. This study highlights the promise of systematic infrared searches and the need for future wider and deeper infrared surveys.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the Origin of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers with Gravitational-wave Spin Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim9\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models (Bayes factor $\ln\mathcal{B}&gt;3$) after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim63\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions can relieve major compact star observation tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii in the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of self-bound hybrid stars with large density discontinuities, and thus are radially stable in either the slow or rapid phase transition context. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning correction for the calorimeter saturation of cosmic-ray ions with the Dark Matter Particle Explorer: towards the PeV scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark MAtter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) instrument is a space-borne cosmic-ray detector, capable of measuring ion fluxes up to $\sim$500 TeV/n. This energy scale is made accessible through its calorimeter, which is the deepest currently operating in orbit. Saturation of the calorimeter readout channels starts occurring above $\sim$100 TeV of incident energy, and can significantly affect the primary energy reconstruction. Different techniques -- analytical and machine-learning based -- were developed to tackle this issue, focusing on the recovery of single-bar deposits, up to several hundreds of TeV. In this work, a new machine-learning technique is presented, which benefits from a unique model to correct the total deposited energy in DAMPE calorimeter. The described method is able to generalise its corrections for different ions and extend the maximum detectable incident energy to the PeV scale. This work is a continuation of the results presented in [1].</description>

      <title>AT2019cmw: A highly luminous, cooling featureless TDE candidate from the disruption of a high mass star in an early-type galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic fields in shaping $\gamma$-ray emission from the Fermi bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their discovery fifteen years ago, the nature and origin of the Fermi bubbles remain unclear. We here investigate the effect a magnetic field can have on a subsonic breeze outflow emanating from the Galactic centre region. The presence of this magnetic field allows anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays within the outflow, shaping the resultant cosmic ray distribution obtained out at large distances within the Galactic halo. We show that our magnetohydrodynamic Galactic breeze model, in combination with an opening angle for the injection of cosmic rays, leads to $\gamma$-ray emission from the Fermi bubble region with relatively sharp edges.</description>

      <title>Rapid jet production and suppression during fast state transitions in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348$-$630</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) launch powerful relativistic jets during bright outburst phases. The properties of these outflows change dramatically between different spectral/accretion states. Compact jets are observed during the hard state and are quenched during the soft state, while discrete ejecta are mainly launched during the hard-to-soft state transition. Currently, we do not understand what triggers the formation/destruction of compact jets or the launch of discrete ejecta. In this context, finding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray emission, such as its fast variability, would imply major progress in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in BH XRBs. Here we show that a brief, strong radio re-brightening during a predominantly soft state of the BH XRB MAXI J1348$-$630 was contemporaneous with a significant increase in the X-ray rms variability observed with NICER in 2019. During this phase, the variability displayed significant changes and, at the same time, MAXI J1348$-$630 launched two relativistic discrete ejecta that we detected with the MeerKAT and ATCA radio-interferometers. We propose that short-lived compact jets were reactivated during this excursion to the hard-intermediate state and were switched off before the ejecta launch, a behavior that has been very rarely observed in these systems. Interestingly, with the caveat of gaps in our radio and X-ray coverage, we suggest a tentative correspondence between the launch of ejecta and the drop in X-ray rms variability in this source, while other typical X-ray signatures associated with discrete ejections are not detected. We discuss how these results provide us with insights into the complex dynamic coupling between the jets and hot corona in BH XRBs.</description>

      <title>Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic centre with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gigaelectronvolt $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading explanation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars remains viable. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by interstellar scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge in the future.
  We constructed synthetic populations of detached millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Still, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$), though part of this contrast reflects our modelling assumptions. LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Thus, identifying millisecond-pulsar binaries among the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, as their gravitational-wave signals alone are indistinguishable. However, coordinated follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array of LISA-selected targets could directly test the millisecond-pulsar explanation of the $\gamma$-ray excess.</description>

      <title>AGN spectral variability across activity states and searches for axion-like particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields.
  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity.
  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Light Travel Time Effects in Kilonova Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo -- commonly attributed to strontium -- possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light -- and therefore the light travel time to an observer -- contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Orbital Modulation in Spider Pulsars: Three Discoveries and a Universal Modulated Fraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as spiders) allow us to probe pulsar winds in their innermost regions, between the light cylinder (radius $\sim10^{7}$ cm) and the companion star (at $\sim10^{11}$ cm). Their flux is known to vary along the orbit, from radio to X-rays. During the past decade, gamma-ray orbital modulation (GOM) has been discovered in a handful of spiders, but its origin remains largely unknown. We present the results of a systematic search for GOM among 43 systems, selecting pulsed 0.1-1 GeV photons and using spin and orbital ephemeris from Fermi's Third Pulsar Catalog. We discover GOM from three spiders - PSR J1124-3653, PSR J1946-5403 and PSR J2215+5135 - and confirm four previous detections. In all seven cases so far, the GOM peaks near the pulsar's superior conjunction. The X-ray orbital light curves are usually in antiphase, peaking when the pulsar is at inferior conjunction, but we find one case where both gamma-rays and X-rays peak around superior conjunction: PSR J1946-5403. We measure the modulated fractions of the GOM and find consistent values for all seven spiders, with an average $22.0\pm2.6\%$. Including eclipsing systems seen edge-on, we find no clear dependence of the modulated fraction on the orbital inclination (within $\simeq$45-90$^\circ$). Our results challenge previous models proposed to explain GOM in spiders, based on inverse Compton and synchrotron emission close to the companion, since these predict a clear dependence on orbital inclination (stronger modulation at high inclinations). We nearly double the number of GOM detections in spiders, showing that it is more common than previously thought.</description>

Abstract: Interstellar magnetic field is essential in various astrophysical phenomena and processes. Pulsar halos are a recently discovered class of TeV gamma-ray sources formed by escaping electrons/positrons from pulsars. The morphology of the halo is regulated by the diffusion of those escaping particles, and hence carries information of the interstellar magnetic field. We suggest that the morphology of TeV pulsar halos can be used as a novel probe of the properties of interstellar magnetic field around the pulsar, such as the Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number and the mean direction. We establish a theoretical relation between these quantities and the observational features of the halo's morphology based on the anisotropic diffusion model, and show how X-ray observations of the pulsar halos can further improve the diagnosis of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</description>

      <title>The Supernova Remnant G284.3$-$1.8 and Its Relation to the Gamma-ray Binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G284.3$-$1.8 is a supernova remnant with a radio shell and thermal X-ray emission. Located near its center is the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, although the physical association between the two systems is not clear yet. Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\mathrm{H} = 6\textrm{--}7 \times 10^{21}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\textrm{--}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the "shell merger" processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Mg}/M_\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Si}/M_\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star. The characteristics of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, on the other hand, are better explained with a model in which its compact object is neutron star. The present results, therefore, would suggest a possible scenario where G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 are both remnants of a common supernova explosion although further observational tests are necessary.</description>

      <title>Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM. In particular, gamma-ray lines could provide a way to measure the DM mass. The excellent energy resolution of the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) will allow us to probe underexplored regions of the DM parameter space while being sensitive to distinctive spectral features of potential DM signals. In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). We estimate the sensitivities of COSI and AMEGO-X to sub-GeV DM in this context, considering a B-L and a purely axial $Z'$ as benchmark examples. We find regions of the parameter space where COSI will provide leading constraints, beyond the strong CMB limits. On the other hand, AMEGO-X would probe most of the viable parameter space leading to continuum gamma rays. The implementation of our generic vector-scalar portal model in the Hazma toolkit is available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing and resampling: a guide to utilising posterior samples from gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories have opened new scientific research in astrophysics, fundamental physics, and cosmology. The collaborations that build and operate these observatories release the interferometric strain data as well as a catalogue of observed signals with accompanying Bayesian posterior distributions. These posteriors, in the form of equally-weighted samples, form a dataset that is used by a multitude of further analyses seeking to constrain the population of merging black holes, identify lensed pairs of signals, and much more. However, many of these analyses rely, often implicitly, on the ability to reconstruct the likelihood and prior from the inputs to the analysis and apply resampling (a statistical technique to generate new samples varying the underlying analysis assumptions). In this work, we first provide a guide on how to reconstruct and modify the posterior density accurately from the inputs for analyses performed with the Bilby inference library. We then demonstrate and compare resampling techniques to produce new posterior sample sets and discuss Pareto-smoothing to improve the efficiency. Finally, we provide examples of how to use resampling to study observed gravitational-wave signals. We hope this guide provides a useful resource for those wishing to use open data products from the LVK for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Multipole moments do not uniquely characterize spacetimes beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments. Given the usefulness of moments in the categorization of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Pulsar Distance Inference from Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are limited in localizing nanohertz continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) by uncertainties in pulsar distances. We introduce a method to infer pulsar distances in two dimensions, using phase information from the pulsar terms of multiple CGW sources. Our approach can enhance distance precision and, in some cases, achieve order-of-magnitude improvements relative to existing one-dimensional distance-inference methods. Using simulations of an SKA-era PTA with realistic parallax-based distance priors, we demonstrate that pulsars at $\sim 1$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision with only a few CGW sources. Such improvements in pulsar-distance precision have important implications for CGW host-galaxy identification and multimessenger observational prospects.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Lorentz-Dirac Dynamics and Post-Newtonian Interaction of Radiating Point Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Resonant Photon-Axion Mixing Driven by Dark Matter Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave propagation in periodically time-dependent media can exhibit driven mode conversion that is absent in static or adiabatic descriptions. We show that photon propagation through a coherent axion dark matter background provides a natural realization of such driven dynamics. In the presence of a magnetic field, the oscillating axion field acts as a coherent temporal drive, inducing resonant photon-axion conversion when the mismatch between their dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $\Delta_\gamma - \Delta_a \approx n m_a$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This driven resonance enables efficient mixing far from the conventional level-crossing regime and disappears entirely upon time averaging, explaining why it is missed in standard treatments. The process constitutes a unitary mode-conversion phenomenon that preserves the axion dark matter number density and is distinct from parametric instabilities or axion decay. A systematic description is naturally provided by Floquet theory. We develop a general framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds and show that the resulting resonant mixing leads to characteristic polarization signatures, with potential implications for astrophysical observations such as blazar polarization.</description>
