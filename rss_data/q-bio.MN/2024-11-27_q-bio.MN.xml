      <title>Synthetic frequency-controlled gene circuits unlock expanded cellular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural biological systems process environmental information through both amplitude and frequency-modulated signals, yet engineered biological circuits have largely relied on amplitude-based regulation alone. Despite the prevalence of frequency-encoded signals in natural systems, fundamental challenges in designing and implementing frequency-responsive gene circuits have limited their development in synthetic biology. Here we present a Time-Resolved Gene Circuit (TRGC) architecture that enables frequency-to-amplitude signal conversion in engineered biological systems. Through systematic analysis, we establish a theoretical framework that guides the design of synthetic circuits capable of distinct frequency-dependent responses, implementing both high-pass and low-pass filtering behaviors. To enable rigorous characterization of these dynamic circuits, we developed a high-throughput automated platform that ensures stable and reproducible measurements of frequency-dependent r esponses across diverse conditions. Using this platform, we demonstrate that these frequency-modulated circuits can access cellular states unreachable through conventional amplitude modulation, significantly expanding the controllable gene expression space in multi-gene systems. Our results show that frequency modulation expands the range of achievable expression patterns when controlling multiple genes through a single input, demonstrating a new paradigm for engineering cellular behaviors. This work establishes frequency modulation as a powerful strategy for expanding the capabilities of engineered biological systems and enhancing cellular response to dynamic signals.</description>

      <title>Graph Frequency Features of Cancer Gene Co-Expression Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex gene interactions play a significant role in cancer progression, driving cellular behaviors that contribute to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Gene co-expression networks model the functional connectivity between genes under various biological conditions. Understanding the system-level evolution of these networks in cancer is critical for elucidating disease mechanisms and informing the development of targeted therapies. While previous studies have primarily focused on structural differences between cancer and normal cell co-expression networks, this study applies graph frequency analysis to cancer transcriptomic signals defined on gene co-expression networks, highlighting the graph spectral characteristics of cancer systems. Using a range of graph frequency filters, we showed that cancer cells display distinctive patterns in the graph frequency content of their gene transcriptomic signals, effectively distinguishing between cancer types and stages. The transformation of the original gene feature space into the graph spectral space captured more intricate cancer properties, as validated by significantly higher F-statistic scores for graph frequency-filtered gene features compared to those in the original space.</description>
