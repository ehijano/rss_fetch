      <title>Pair Space in Classical Mechanics II. N-Body Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previous work introduced pair space, which is spanned by the center of mass of a system and the relative positions (pair positions) of its constituent bodies. Here, I show that in the $N$-body Newtonian problem, a configuration that does not remain on a fixed line in space is a central configuration if and only if it conserves all pair angular momenta. For collinear systems, I obtain a set of equations for the ratios of the relative distances of the bodies, from which I derive some bounds on the minimal length of the line. For the non-collinear case I derive some geometrical relations, independent of the masses of the bodies. These are necessary conditions for a non-collinear configuration to be central. They generalize, to arbitrary $N$, a consequence of the Dziobek relation, which holds for $N=4$.</description>

      <title>Pair Space in Classical Mechanics I. The Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce an extended configuration space for classical mechanical systems, called pair-space, which is spanned by the relative positions of all the pairs of bodies. To overcome the non-independence of this basis, one adds to the Lagrangian a term containing auxiliary variables. As a proof of concept, I apply this representation to the three-body problem with a generalized potential that depends on the distance $r$ between the bodies as $r^{-n}$. I obtain the equilateral and collinear solutions (corresponding to the Lagrange and Euler solutions if $n=1$) in a particularly simple way. In the collinear solution, this representation leads to several new bounds on the relative distances of the bodies.</description>

      <title>RG analysis of spontaneous stochasticity on a fractal lattice: linearization and bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamical models on a self-similar space-time lattice as toy models for multiscale motion in hydrodynamic turbulence. Here an ill-posed ideal system is regularized at small scales and the vanishing regularization (inviscid) limit is considered. By relating the inviscid limit to the dynamics of the RG operator acting on the flow maps, we explain the existence and universality (regularization independence) of the limiting solutions as a consequence of the fixed-point RG attractor. Considering the local linearized dynamics, we show that the approach to the inviscid limit is governed by the universal RG eigenmode. We also demonstrate that the RG attractor undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation with parameter variation, thereby changing the nature of the inviscid limit. In the case of chaotic RG dynamics, we introduce the stochastic RG operator acting on Markov kernels. Then the RG attractor becomes stochastic, which explains the existence and universality of spontaneously stochastic solutions in the limit of vanishing noise. We study a linearized structure (RG eigenmode) of the stochastic RG attractor and its period-doubling bifurcation. Viewed as prototypes of Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity, our models explain its mechanism, universality and potential diversity.</description>

      <title>Extended Cartan homotopy formula for higher Chern-Simons-Antoniadis-Savvidy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider extended Cartan homotopy formula (ECHF) for higher gauge theory. Firstly, we construct an oriented simplex based on 2-connections and present differential and integral forms of the higher ECHF. Then, we study the higher Chern-Simons-Antoniadis-Savvidy (ChSAS) theory and prove that the higher ECHF can reproduce the higher Chern-Weil theorem and give higher triangle equation. We finally conclude from the higher ECHF that a higher transgression form can be written as the difference of two higher ChSAS forms minus an exact form.</description>

      <title>Coisotropic embeddings of precosymplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a complete characterisation of coisotropic embeddings of precosymplectic manifolds into cosymplectic manifolds. This result extends a theorem of Gotay about coisotropic embeddings of presymplectic manifolds. We also extend to the cosymplectic case some results of A. Weinstein which generalise the Darboux theorem. While symplectic geometry is the natural framework for developing Hamiltonian mechanics, cosymplectic geometry is the corresponding framework for time-dependent Hamiltonian mechanics. The motivation behind proving this theorem is to generalise known results for symplectic geometry to cosymplectic geometry, so that they can be used to study time-dependent systems, for instance for the regularization problem of singular Lagrangian systems.</description>

      <title>A quantum anchor for higher Koszul brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the chain map between the de Rham and Poisson complexes on a Poisson manifold also maps the Koszul bracket of differential forms into the Schouten bracket of multivector fields.
  In the generalized case of a $P_\infty$-structure, where a Poisson bivector $P$ is replaced by an arbitrary even multivector obeying $[[P,P]]=0$, an analog of the chain map and an $L_\infty$-morphism from the higher Koszul brackets into the Schouten bracket are also known; however, they differ significantly in nature.
  In the present paper, we address the problem of quantizing this picture. In particular, we show that the $L_\infty$-morphism is quantized into a single linear operator, which is a formal Fourier integral operator.
  This paper employs Voronov's thick morphism technique and quantum Mackenzie-Xu transformations in the framework of $L_\infty$-algebroids.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter equation, Leibniz algebras, racks and related algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the relations between various constructions of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation from Leibniz algebras, racks, 3-Leibniz algebras, 3-racks, linear racks, trilinear racks, and give new constructions of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. First we show that a 3-Leibniz algebra naturally gives rise to a 3-rack on the underlying vector space, which generalizes Kinyon's construction of racks from Leibniz algebras. Then we show that a trilinear rack naturally gives rise to a linear rack. Combined with Lebed's construction of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation from linear racks, our results give an intrinsic explanation of Abramov and Zappala's construction of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation from trilinear racks. Next we show that a 3-Leibniz algebra gives rise to a trilinear rack, which generalizes Abramov and Zappala's construction from 3-Lie algebras. Finally, we construct solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation using central extensions of 3-Leibniz algebras and Leibniz algebras. In particular, given a 3-Leibniz algebra, there are two different approaches to construct solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, namely either consider the central extension of the Leibniz algebra on the fundamental objects, or consider the Leibniz algebra on the fundamental objects of the central extension of the 3-Leibniz algebra. We also show that there is a homomorphism between the corresponding solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantizations of transposed Poisson algebras by Novikov deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of the Novikov deformation of a commutative associative algebra and the corresponding classical limit are introduced. We show such a classical limit belongs to a subclass of transposed Poisson algebras, and hence the Novikov deformation is defined to be the quantization of the corresponding transposed Poisson algebra. As a direct consequence, we revisit the relationship between transposed Poisson algebras and Novikov-Poisson algebras due to the fact that there is a natural Novikov deformation of the commutative associative algebra in a Novikov-Poisson algebra. Hence all transposed Poisson algebras of Novikov-Poisson type, including unital transposed Poisson algebras, can be quantized. Finally, we classify the quantizations of $2$-dimensional complex transposed Poisson algebras in which the Lie brackets are non-abelian up to equivalence.</description>

      <title>Multi-product Zeno effect with higher order convergence rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To implement the dynamics of a projected Hamiltonian or Lindbladian, the quantum Zeno effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that approximates the effective dynamic by intersecting the Hamiltonian or Lindblad evolution by any quantum operation that converges to the desired projected subspace. Unlike the related Trotter product formula, the best-known convergence rate of the quantum Zeno effect is limited to the order $1/n$. In this work, we improve the convergence rate using a multi-product formula to achieve any power of $1/n^{K+1}$, employing a modified Chernoff Lemma, a modified Dunford-Segal approximation, and the holomorphic functional calculus. We then briefly illustrate this scheme using the bosonic cat code, as well as a broad class of examples governed by the `Bang-Bang' method used to decouple systems from their environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode statistical properties of the initial conditions of our universe. Mathematically, they can often be written as Mellin integrals of a certain rational function associated to graphs, namely the flat space wavefunction. The singularities of these cosmological integrals are parameterized by binary hyperplane arrangements. Using different algebraic tools, we shed light on the differential and difference equations satisfied by these integrals. Moreover, we study a multivariate version of partial fractioning of the flat space wavefunction, and propose a graph-based algorithm to compute this decomposition.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this note is to study integrable properties of a generating function of the HOMFLY-PT invariants of the Hopf link colored with different representations. We demonstrate that such a generating function is a $\tau$-function of the KP hierarchy. Furthermore, this Hopf generating function in the case of composite representations, which is a generating function of the 4-point functions in topological string (corresponding to the resolved conifold with branes on the four external legs), is a $\tau$-function of the universal character(UC) hierarchy put on the topological locus. We also briefly discuss a simple matrix model associated with the UC hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider hard-potential cutoff multi-species Boltzmann operators modeling microscopic binary elastic collisions and bimolecular reversible chemical reactions inside a gaseous mixture. We prove that the spectral gap estimate derived for the linearized elastic collision operator can be exploited to deduce an explicit negative upper bound for the Dirichlet form of the linearized chemical Boltzmann operator. Such estimate may be used to quantify explicitly the rate of convergence of close-to-equilibrium solutions to the reactive Boltzmann equation toward the global chemical equilibrium of the mixture.</description>

      <title>Mountain-Pass Solutions in 2D Turbulence with Generalized Sobolev Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends the study of mean field equations arising in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence by introducing generalized weighted Sobolev operators. Employing variational methods, particularly the mountain pass theorem and a refined blow-up analysis, we establish the existence of nontrivial solutions under broader boundary conditions than those considered in previous studies. In contrast to the unweighted approach developed by Ricciardi (2006), the incorporation of variable weights \(\rho(x)\) enables a more accurate representation of complex geometric domains. This generalization addresses cases where the geometry of the manifold or external factors induce local fluctuations, thereby enhancing the applicability of mean field models to real-world turbulence phenomena. The weighted Sobolev framework also strengthens control over the nonlinearity in the problem, reducing the risk of blow-up and ensuring the convergence of solutions in the \(H^1(M)\) space. The analysis reveals new conditions for the existence of solutions, including situations where classical methods may fail due to a lack of compactness. The significant advancement lies in the flexibility of the model; the inclusion of weights allows for a more precise description of physical systems in varied settings, representing a key advantage over the original unweighted problem. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of geometric and physical constraints in turbulent behavior and pave new pathways for future research on nonlinear partial differential equations in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Action of free fermions on Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clifford algebra of the endomorphisms of the exterior algebra of a countably dimensional vector space induces natural bosonic shadows, i.e. families of linear maps between the cohomologies of complex grassmannians. The main result of this paper is to provide a determinantal formula expressing generating functions of such endomorphisms unifying several classical special cases. For example the action over a point recovers the Jacobi-Trudy formula in the theory of symmetric functions or the Giambelli's one in classical Schubert calculus, whereas the action of degree preserving endomorphisms take into account the finite type version of the Date-Jimbo-Kashiwara-Miwa bosonic vertex operator representation of the Lie algebra $gl(\infty)$. The fermionic actions on (finite type) bosonic spaces is described in terms of the classical theory of symmetric functions. The main guiding principle is the fact that the exterior algebra is a (non irreducible) representation of the ring of symmetric functions, which is the way we use to spell the ``finite type'' Boson-Fermion correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model of the evolution of a (solid) magnetoelastic material. More specifically, the model we consider describes the evolution of a compressible magnetoelastic material with a non-convex energy and coupled to a gradient flow equation for the magnetization in the quasi-static setting. The viscous dissipation considered in this model induces an extended material derivative in the magnetic force balance. We prove existence of weak solutions based on De Giorgi's minimizing movements scheme, which allows us to deal with the non-convex energy as well as the non-convex state space for the deformation. In the application of this method we rely on the fact that the magnetic force balance in the model can be expressed in terms of the same energy and dissipation potentials as the equation of motion, allowing us to model the functional for the discrete minimization problem based on these potentials.</description>

      <title>Learning the Rolling Penny Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider learning the dynamics of a typical nonholonomic system -- the rolling penny. A nonholonomic system is a system subject to nonholonomic constraints. Unlike holonomic constraints, a nonholonomic constraint does not define a submanifold on the configuration space. Therefore, the inverse problem of finding the constraints has to involve the tangent space. This paper discuss how to learn the dynamics, as well as the constraints for such a system given the data set of discrete trajectories on the tangent bundle $TQ$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries II: Noether Realization in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the gravitational phase space. We introduce a symmetry algebroid $\mathcal{T}$ which allows us to include radiation in an algebraic framework. We show that $\mathcal{T}$ admits a non-linear realization on the asymptotic phase space generated by a Noether charge defined non-perturbatively for all spins. Besides, this Noether charge is conserved in the absence of radiation. Moreover, at non radiative cuts, the algebroid can be restricted to the wedge symmetry algebra studied in ArXiv:2409.12178. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic Einstein's equations. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is also represented canonically.</description>

      <title>Cascade equation for the discontinuities in the Stefan problem with surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stefan problem with surface tension is well known to exhibit discontinuities in the associated moving aggregate (i.e., in the domain occupied by the solid), whose structure has only been understood under translational or radial symmetry so far. In this paper, we derive an auxiliary partial differential equation of second-order hyperbolic type, referred to as the cascade equation, that captures said discontinuities in the absence of any symmetry assumptions. Specializing to the one-phase setting, we introduce a novel (global) notion of weak solution to the cascade equation, which is defined as a limit of mean-field game equilibria. For the spatial dimension two, we show the existence of such a weak solution and prove a natural perimeter estimate on the associated moving aggregate.</description>

      <title>Global Topological Dirac Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental dynamical state of interacting oscillators, observed in natural biological rhythms and in the brain. Global synchronization which occurs when non-linear or chaotic oscillators placed on the nodes of a network display the same dynamics as received great attention in network theory. Here we propose and investigate Global Topological Dirac Synchronization on higher-order networks such as cell and simplicial complexes. This is a state where oscillators associated to simplices and cells of arbitrary dimension, coupled by the Topological Dirac operator, operate at unison. By combining algebraic topology with non-linear dynamics and machine learning, we derive the topological conditions under which this state exists and the dynamical conditions under which it is stable. We provide evidence of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes (networks) and 2-dimensional simplicial and cell complexes where Global Topological Dirac Synchronization can be observed. Our results point out that Global Topological Dirac Synchronization is a possible dynamical state of simplicial and cell complexes that occur only in some specific network topologies and geometries, the latter ones being determined by the weights of the higher-order networks</description>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how to explicitly construct a bidiagonal factorization of the banded recurrence matrix that appears in mixed multiple orthogonality on the step-line in terms of the coeffcients of the mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials. The construction is based on the \(LU\) factorization of the moment matrix and Christoffel transformations applied to the matrix of measures and the associated mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple definition of a Born geometry in the framework of K\"unneth geometry. While superficially different, this new definition is equivalent to the known definitions in terms of para-quaternionic or generalized geometries. We discuss integrability of Born structures and their associated connections. In particular we find that for integrable Born geometries the Born connection is obtained by a simple averaging under a conjugation from the K\"unneth connection. We also give examples of integrable Born geometries on nilmanifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods. The method is easily extended to solving similar nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic geometry at infinity of quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an approach developed by Melrose to study the geometry at infinity of the Nakajima metric on the reduced Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, we show that the Nakajima metric on a quiver variety is quasi-asymptotically conical (QAC) whenever its defining parameters satisfy an appropriate genericity assumption. As such, it is of bounded geometry and of maximal volume growth. Being QAC is one of two main ingredients allowing us to use the work of Kottke and the second author to compute its reduced $L^2$-cohomology and prove the Vafa-Witten conjecture. The other is a spectral gap for the Hodge-deRham operator associated with an exact $3$-Sasakian wedge metric that we obtain using the Weitzenb\"ock formula of Semmelmann and Weingart on quaternionic-K\"ahler manifolds. This yields in particular a generalization and a different proof of the vanishing theorem in cohomology originally obtained by Galicki and Salamon for closed $3$-Sasakian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to the third threshold, i.e., for parameters $\beta^2 &lt; 6\pi$. The key novelty in our approach is the introduction of the so-called resonant equation, whose solution is entirely deterministic and completely captures the size of the solution to the dynamical sine-Gordon model. The probabilistic fluctuations in the dynamical sine-Gordon model are then controlled using uniform estimates for modified stochastic objects.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian 1-form structure of Calogero-Moser type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the variational principle for the Lagrangian 1-form structure for long-range
  models of Calogero-Moser (CM) type. The multiform variational principle involves variations
  with respect to both the field variables as well as the independent variables
  corresponding to deformations of the time-curves in a multi-time space. The ensuing
  generalised Euler-Lagrange (gEL) equations comprise a system of multi-time
  EL equations, as well as constraints from so-called `alien derivatives' and `corner
  equations' arising from how variations on different coordinate curves match up.
  The closure relation, i.e. closedness of the Lagrange 1-form on solutions of the EL
  system, guarantees the stationarity of the action functional under deformation of the
  time-curves, and hence the multidimensional consistency of the corresponding gEL
  system. Using this as an integrability criterion on the Lagrangian level, we apply the
  system to some ans\"atze on the kinetic form of the Lagrangian components, associated
  with models of CM type without specifying the potentials. We show that from this
  integrability criterion the general elliptic form of the three systems,
  Calogero-Moser, Ruijsenaars-Schneider, and Goldfish systems, can be derived.
  We extend the analysis to an associated Hamiltonian formalism, via Noether's theorem
  and by applying Legendre transformations. Thus, the multiform variational principle
  leads to a system of generalised Hamilton equations describing Hamiltonian commuting flows for the mentioned elliptic models.</description>

      <title>Global existence and mean-field limit for a stochastic interacting particle system of signed Coulomb charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of stochastic differential equations with singular drift which describes the dynamics of signed particles in two dimensions interacting by the Coulomb potential. In contrast to the well-studied cases of identical particles that either all repel each other or all attract each other, this system contains both `positive' and `negative' particles. Equal signs repel and opposite signs attract each other; apart from the sign, the potential is the same.
  We derive results on well-posedness of the system, on the type of collisions that can occur, and on the mean-field limit as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our results demonstrate that the signed system shares features of both the fully repulsive and the fully attractive cases. Our proof method is inspired by the work of Fournier and Jourdain (The Annals of Applied Probability, 27, pp. 2807-2861, 2017) on the fully attractive case; we construct an approximate system of equations, establish uniform estimates, and use tightness to pass to limits.</description>

      <title>Signed R\'enyi Entropy and Quantum Second Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We modify the R\'enyi (1961) axioms for entropy to apply to negative (``signed") measures as arise, for example, in phase-space representations of quantum mechanics. We obtain two new measures of (lack of) information about a system -- which we propose as signed analogs to classical Shannon entropy and classical R\'enyi entropy, respectively. We show that signed R\'enyi entropy witnesses non-classicality of a system. Specifically, a measure has at least one negative component if and only if signed R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropy is negative for some $\alpha &gt; 1$. The corresponding non-classicality test does not work with signed Shannon entropy. We next show that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy, when $k$ is a positive integer, is Schur-concave. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy is not Schur-concave.) We then establish an abstract quantum H-theorem for signed measures. We prove that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy is non-decreasing under classical (``decohering") evolution of a signed measure, where the latter could be a Wigner function or other phase-space representation of a quantum system. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy may be non-monotonic.) We also provide a characterization of the Second Law for signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy in terms of what we call eventual classicalization of evolution of a system. We conclude with an argument that signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy of the Wigner function is constant under Moyal bracket evolution.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of gauged $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions to all orders in fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that generalised geometry provides a particularly elegant rewriting of the action and symmetries of 10-dimensional supergravity theories, up to the lowest nontrivial order in fermions. By exhibiting the full symmetry calculations in the second-order formalism, we show in the $\mathcal N=1$ case that this analysis can be upgraded to all orders in fermions and we obtain a strikingly simple form of the action as well as of the supersymmetry transformations, featuring overall only five higher-fermionic terms. Surprisingly, even after expressing the action in terms of classical (non-generalised geometric) variables one obtains a simplification of the usual formulae. This in particular confirms that generalised geometry provides the natural set of variables for studying (the massless level of) string theory. We also show how this new reformulation implies the compatibility of the Poisson-Lie T-duality with the equations of motion of the full supergravity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We justify Prandtl equations and higher order Prandtl expansion from the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equations. Our fluid data is of the form $\text{shear flow}$, plus $\sqrt{\kappa}$ order term in analytic spaces in $(x_1, x_2)\in\mathbb T^2$ and Sobolev in $x_3\in\mathbb{R}_+$. This work is the first to rigorously justify the Prandtl equations from the hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann equations. The novelty lies in obtaining estimates for the linearized Boltzmann equation with a diffusive boundary condition around a Prandtl layer shear flow in analytic spaces. The key techniques involve delicate commutator estimates and the use of local conservation law.</description>

      <title>Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The level projection method cannot be applied straightforwardly to extract matrix geometries to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels (Landau levels). We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived straightforwardly even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify the basic properties of the matrix geometries through the analysis of concrete models. The matrix geometries of an expanding two-sphere and ellipsoids are investigated using the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behavior quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. The difference between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid is investigated numerically.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the codimension-one nonlinear asymptotic stability of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family of black holes in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-neutral scalar field model, up to and including the event horizon. More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one "submanifold" $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family, such that any data in $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for "generic" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the "stability" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated "Aretakis instability" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.</description>

      <title>Cups and Gates I: Cohomology invariants and logical quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take initial steps towards a general framework for constructing logical gates in general quantum CSS codes. Viewing CSS codes as cochain complexes, we observe that cohomology invariants naturally give rise to diagonal logical gates. We show that such invariants exist if the quantum code has a structure that relaxes certain properties of a differential graded algebra. We show how to equip quantum codes with such a structure by defining cup products on CSS codes. The logical gates obtained from this approach can be implemented by a constant-depth unitary circuit. In particular, we construct a $\Lambda$-fold cup product that can produce a logical operator in the $\Lambda$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy on $\Lambda$ copies of the same quantum code, which we call the copy-cup gate. For any desired $\Lambda$, we can construct several families of quantum codes that support gates in the $\Lambda$-th level with various asymptotic code parameters.</description>

      <title>Exponentially-tailed regularity and time asymptotic for the homogeneous Boltzmann equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.06596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present in this document the Lebesgue and Sobolev propagation of exponential tails for solutions of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation for hard and Maxwell interactions. In addition, we show the $L^{p}$-integrability creation of such tails in the case of hard interactions. The document also presents a result on exponentially-fast convergence to thermodynamical equilibrium and propagation of singularities and regularization of such solutions. All these results are valid under the mere Grad's cut-off condition for the angular scattering kernel. Highlights of this contribution include: (1) full range of $L^{p}$-norms with $p\in[1,\infty]$, (2) analysis for the critical case of Maxwell interactions, (3) propagation of fractional Sobolev exponential tails using pointwise conmutators, and (4) time asymptotic and propagation of regularity and singularities under general physical data. In many ways, this work is an improvement and an extension of several classical works in the area; we use known techniques and introduce new and flexible ideas that achieve the proofs in an elementary manner.</description>

      <title>On the Wasserstein distance and the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem for Gibbs measures of lattice systems of interacting particles at thermal equilibrium. In a nutshell, Dobrushin's uniqueness theorem provides a practical way to derive sufficient conditions on the inverse temperature and/or model parameters assuring uniqueness of Gibbs measures by reducing the uniqueness problem to a suitable estimate of the Wasserstein distance between pairs of 1-point Gibbs measures with different boundary conditions. After proving a general result of completeness for the Wasserstein distance, we reformulate the Dobrushin uniqueness theorem in a convenient form for lattice systems of interacting particles described by Hamiltonians that are not necessarily translation-invariant with possibly infinite-range pair-potentials and with general complete metric spaces as single-spin spaces. Our reformulation includes existence, and covers both classical and the Euclidean version of quantum lattice systems. Further, a generalization to the Dobrushin-Shlosman theorem for translation-invariant lattice systems is given. Subsequently, we give a series of applications of these uniqueness criteria to some high-temperature classical lattice systems including the Heisenberg, Potts and Ising models. An application to classical lattice systems for which the local Gibbs measures are convex perturbations of Gaussian measures is also given.</description>

      <title>Recursions and ODEs for the correlators in integrable systems and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integrable system is often formulated as a flat connection, satisfying a Lax equation. It is given in terms of compatible systems having a common solution called the ``wave function" $\Psi$ living in a Lie group $G$, which satisfies some differential equations with rational coefficients. From this wave function, it is usual to define a sequence of ``correlators" $W_n$, that play an important role in many applications in mathematical physics. Here, we show how to systematically obtain ordinary differential equations (ODE) and recursion relations with polynomial coefficients for the correlators.
  An application is random matrix theory, where the wave functions are the expectation value of the characteristic polynomial, they form a family of orthogonal polynomials, and are known to satisfy an integrable system. The correlators are then the correlation functions of resolvents or of eigenvalue densities. We give the ODE and recursion on the matrix size that they satisfy. In addition, we discuss generic Fuchsian systems, namely, Schlesinger systems.</description>

      <title>A single layer representation of the scattered field for multiple scattering problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering of scalar waves by a set of scatterers is considered. It is proven that the scattered field can be represented as an integral supported by any smooth surface enclosing the scatterers. This is a generalization of the series expansion over spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions for spherical geometries. More precisely, given a set of scatterers, the field scattered by any subset can be expressed as an integral over any smooth surface enclosing the given subset alone. It is then possible to solve the multiple scattering problem by using this integral representation instead of an expansion over spherical harmonics. This result is used to develop an extension of the Fast Multipole Method in order to deal with subsets that are not enclosed within non-intersecting balls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fermionic entanglement entropy for the free Dirac field in a bounded spatial region of Minkowski spacetime. In order to make the system ultraviolet finite, a regularization is introduced. An area law is proven in the limiting cases where the volume tends to infinity and/or the regularization length tends to zero. The technical core of the paper is to generalize a theorem of Harold Widom to pseudo-differential operators whose principal symbols develop a specific discontinuity at a single point.</description>

Abstract: Building on the recent work in~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 235204 (2024)], we propose a Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture. We demonstrate the existence of a well-defined similarity transformation that renders this Hamiltonian self-adjoint for the nontrivial Riemann zeros. Specifically, we show that the eigenfunctions of the transformed operator are orthogonal and square-integrable, and crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. This represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a multi-band BCS free energy functional and prove that for a multi-band superconductor the effect of inter-band coupling can only increase the critical temperature, irrespective of its attractive or repulsive nature and its strength. Further, for weak coupling and weaker inter-band coupling, we prove that the dependence of the increase in critical temperature on the inter-band coupling is (1) linear, if there are two or more equally strongly superconducting bands, or (2) quadratic, if there is only one dominating band.</description>

      <title>WKB Methods for Finite Difference Schrodinger Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop WKB techniques for the finite difference Schrodinger equation, following the construction of the WKB approach for the standard differential Schrodinger equation. In particular, we will develop an all-order WKB algorithm to get arbitrary hbar-corrections and construct a general quantum momentum, underlining the various properties of its coefficients and the quantities that will be used when constructing the quantization condition. In doing so, we discover the existence of additional periodic factors that need to be considered in order to obtain the most general solution to the problem at hand. We will then proceed to study the simplest non trivial example, the linear potential case and the Bessel functions, that provide a solution to the linear problem.
  After studying the resurgence properties of the Bessel functions from an analytical and numerical point of view, we will then proceed to use those results in order to build general connection formulae, allowing us to connect the local solutions defined on two sides of a turning point into a smooth solution on the whole real line. With those connection formulae, we will analyse a selection of problems, constructing the discrete spectrum of various finite difference Schrodinger problems and comparing our results with existing literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new family of IR dualities in three space-time dimensions with eight supercharges. In contrast to 3d mirror symmetry, these dualities map Coulomb branches to Coulomb branches and Higgs branches to Higgs branches in the deep IR. For a large class of quiver gauge theories with an emergent Coulomb branch global symmetry, one can construct a sequence of such dualities by step-wise implementing a set of quiver mutations. The duality sequence gives a set of quiver gauge theories which flow to the same IR fixed point - a phenomenon we refer to as IR N-ality. We show that this set of N-al quivers always contains a theory for which the rank of the IR Coulomb branch symmetry is manifest in the UV. For a special subclass of theories, the emergent symmetry algebra itself can be read off from the quiver description of the aforementioned theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the Rumin differentials of the 5-dimensional graded nilpotent Lie group that appears as osculating group of generic rank two distributions in dimension five. In irreducible unitary representations of this group, the Rumin differentials provide intriguing generalizations of the classical quantum harmonic oscillator. For the Schrodinger representations, we compute the spectrum and the zeta regularized determinant of each Rumin differential. In the generic representations, we evaluate their alternating product, i.e., the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preparation of thermal states of matter is a crucial task in quantum simulation. In this work, we prove that a recently introduced, efficiently implementable dissipative evolution thermalizes to the Gibbs state in time scaling polynomially with system size at high enough temperatures for any Hamiltonian that satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound, such as local Hamiltonians on a lattice. Furthermore, we show the efficient adiabatic preparation of the associated purifications or "thermofield double" states. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results rigorously establishing the efficient preparation of high-temperature Gibbs states and their purifications. In the low-temperature regime, we show that implementing this family of dissipative evolutions for inverse temperatures polynomial in the system's size is computationally equivalent to standard quantum computations. On a technical level, for high temperatures, our proof makes use of the mapping of the generator of the evolution into a Hamiltonian, and then connecting its convergence to that of the infinite temperature limit. For low temperature, we instead perform a perturbation at zero temperature and resort to circuit-to-Hamiltonian mappings akin to the proof of universality of quantum adiabatic computing. Taken together, our results show that a family of quasi-local dissipative evolutions efficiently prepares a large class of quantum many-body states of interest, and has the potential to mirror the success of classical Monte Carlo methods for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric constraints on Ekman boundary layer solutions in non-flat regions with well-prepared data</title>

Abstract: The construction of Ekman boundary layer solutions near the non-flat boundaries presents a complex challenge, with limited research on this issue. In Masmoudi's pioneering work [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432--483], the Ekman boundary layer solution was investigated on the domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times [\varepsilon f(x,y), 1]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small constant and $f(x,y)$ denotes a periodic smooth function. This study investigates the influence of the geometric structure of the boundary $B(x,y)$ within the boundary layer. Specifically, for well-prepared initial data in the domain $\mathbb{R}^2\times[B(x,y), B(x,y)+2]$, if the boundary surface $B(x,y)$ is smooth and satisfies certain geometric constraints concerning its Gaussian and mean curvatures, then we derive an approximate boundary layer solution. Additionally, according to the curvature and incompressible conditions, the limit system we constructed is a 2D primitive system with damping and rotational effects. From the model's background, it reflects the characteristics arising from rotational effects. Finally, we validate the convergence of this approximate solution. No smallness condition on the amplitude of boundary $B(x, y)$ is required.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown deriving the pseudometrics from unitary transformations is necessary to recover a value of zero if two systems are topologically conjugate. Therefore the pseudometrics for quantifying deviation from conjugacy are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Finally, geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugac Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible solutions given just two Pareto points based. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problems and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified `man-made' or bio-inspired approaches. The benefits of considering operator based and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism were demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>A new framework for particle-wave interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In plasma physics, collisionless charged particles are transported following the dynamics of a meanfield Vlasov equation with a self-consistent electric field generated by the charge density. Due to the long range interaction between particles, the generating electric field oscillates and disperses like a Klein-Gordon dispersive wave, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves. The oscillatory electric field then in turn drives particles. Despite its great physical importance, the question of whether such a nonlinear particle-wave interaction would remain regular globally and be damped in the large time has been an outstanding open problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework to resolve this exact nonlinear interaction. Specifically, we employ the framework to establish the large time behavior and scattering of solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Klein-Gordon system in the small initial data regime. The novelty of this work is to provide a detailed physical space description of particles moving in an oscillatory field and to resolve oscillations for the electric field generated by the collective interacting particles. This appears to be the first such a result analyzing oscillations in the physical phase space $\mathbb{R}^3_x\times \mathbb{R}_v^3$.</description>
