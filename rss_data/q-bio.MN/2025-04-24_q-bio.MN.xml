      <title>Additive Invariants of Open Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify all additive invariants of open Petri nets: these are $\mathbb{N}$-valued invariants which are additive with respect to sequential and parallel composition of open Petri nets. In particular, we prove two classification theorems: one for open Petri nets and one for monically open Petri nets (i.e. open Petri nets whose interfaces are specified by monic maps). Our results can be summarized as follows. The additive invariants of open Petri nets are completely determined by their values on a particular class of single-transition Petri nets. However, for monically open Petri nets, the additive invariants are determined by their values on transitionless Petri nets and all single-transition Petri nets. Our results confirm a conjecture of John Baez (stated during the AMS' 2022 Mathematical Research Communities workshop).</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>
