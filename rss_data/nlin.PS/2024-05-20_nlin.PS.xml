      <title>Rogue waves excitation on zero-background in the (2+1)-dimensional KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letters, we propose a novel self-mapping transformation of the (2+1) dimensional KdV equation, and construct rather general classes of solutions with decaying property with three arbitrary functions of time. The highlight of this method is that it allows us to generate various of basic rogue waves excited on zero-background, including the exponentially decaying line-soliton and dromion as well as the algebraically decaying lump in the -plane turn out to be special cases of these solutions. Our findings unravels new interesting relations between rogue wave and line-soliton, dromion and lump.</description>

      <title>Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Reduced Order Modeling of Plasma Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Reduced order models are becoming increasingly important for rendering complex and multiscale spatio-temporal dynamics computationally tractable. The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.</description>

      <title>Lifetime Characterization of Extreme Wave Localizations in Crossing Seas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rogue waves (RWs) can form on the ocean surface due to quasi-four wave resonant interaction or superposition principle. Both mechanisms have been acutely studied. The first of the two is known as the nonlinear focusing mechanism and leads to an increased probability of rogue waves when wave conditions are favourable, i.e., when unidirectionality and high narrowband energy of the wave field are satisfied. This work delves into the dynamics of extreme wave focusing in crossing seas, revealing a distinct type of nonlinear RWs, characterized by a decisive longevity compared to those generated by the dispersive focusing mechanism. In fact, through fully nonlinear hydrodynamic numerical simulations, we show that the interactions between two crossing unidirectional wave beams can trigger fully localized and robust development of RWs. These coherent structures, characterized by a typical spectral broadening then spreading in the form of dual bimodality and recurrent wave group focusing, not only defy the weakening expectation of quasi-four wave resonant interaction in directionally spread wave fields, but also differ from classical focusing mechanisms already mentioned. This has been determined following a rigorous lifespan-based statistical analysis of extreme wave events in our fully nonlinear simulations. Utilizing the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger framework, we also show that such intrinsic focusing dynamics can also be captured by weakly nonlinear wave evolution equations. This opens new research avenues for further explorations of these complex and intriguing wave phenomena in hydrodynamics as well as other nonlinear and dispersive multi-wave systems.</description>

      <title>Engineered Ordinary Differential Equations as Classification Algorithm (EODECA): thorough characterization and testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EODECA (Engineered Ordinary Differential Equations as Classification Algorithm) is a novel approach at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems theory, presenting a unique framework for classification tasks [1]. This method stands out with its dynamical system structure, utilizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to efficiently handle complex classification challenges. The paper delves into EODECA's dynamical properties, emphasizing its resilience against random perturbations and robust performance across various classification scenarios. Notably, EODECA's design incorporates the ability to embed stable attractors in the phase space, enhancing reliability and allowing for reversible dynamics. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive analysis by expanding on the work [1], and employing a Euler discretization scheme. In particular, we evaluate EODECA's performance across five distinct classification problems, examining its adaptability and efficiency. Significantly, we demonstrate EODECA's effectiveness on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving impressive accuracies of $98.06\%$ and $88.21\%$, respectively. These results are comparable to those of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), underscoring EODECA's potential in complex data processing tasks. We further explore the model's learning journey, assessing its evolution in both pre and post training environments and highlighting its ability to navigate towards stable attractors. The study also investigates the invertibility of EODECA, shedding light on its decision-making processes and internal workings. This paper presents a significant step towards a more transparent and robust machine learning paradigm, bridging the gap between machine learning algorithms and dynamical systems methodologies.</description>
