      <title>Comment on `The Classical Limit of Teleparallel Gravity'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically discuss the claims of a recent article regarding the Newtonian limit of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) in pure-tetrad formulation (arXiv:2406.17594). In particular, we refute this article's purported main result that if a regular Newtonian limit exists, the torsion of the limiting derivative operator (i.e., connection) necessarily vanishes.</description>

      <title>An exact solution describing a scalar counterpart to the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime is an exact solution of the Einstein electrovacuum equations describing a black hole immersed in a magnetic field which is asymptotically aligned with the z-axis. It plays an important role in our understanding of the interplay between geometry and matter, and is often used as a proxy for astrophysical environments. Here, we construct the scalar counterpart to the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime: a non-asymptotically flat black hole geometry with an everywhere regular scalar field whose gradient is asymptotically aligned with the z-axis.</description>

      <title>Do causal sets have symmetries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal sets are locally finite, partially ordered sets (posets), which are considered as discrete models of spacetimes. On the one hand, causal sets corresponding to a spacetime manifold are commonly generated with a random process called sprinkling. This process keeps only a discrete set of points of the manifold and their causal relations (loosing the spacetime symmetries in each sprinkle). On the other hand, the main conjecture of causal set theory is that given an ensemble of causal sets there is a corresponding spacetime manifold and the continuum symmetries of it are like all manifold properties "reconstructable" from the partial orders of all the causal sets in the ensemble. But most generic finite posets have very few layers ("instances of time") in contrast to sprinkles with many layers in a sufficiently large spacetime region.
  In a recent project, I investigated the automorphism groups of (finite) posets in order to identify and classify their symmetries systematically. The comparison of local symmetries of generic posets (including Kleitmann-Rothschild orders) with sprinkled causal sets may help us to find those posets that can serve as discrete spacetime models in causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Parameter control for eccentric, precessing binary black hole simulations with SpEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes provide the most accurate description of the binary dynamics and the emitted gravitational wave signal. However, practical considerations such as imperfect initial data and initial parameters mean that achieving target parameters, such as the orbital eccentricity or the black hole spin directions, at the beginning of the usable part of the simulation is challenging. In this paper, we devise a method to produce simulations with specific target parameters, namely the Keplerian orbital parameters - eccentricity, semi-major axis, mean anomaly - and the black hole spin vectors using SpEC. The method is an extension of the current process for achieving vanishing eccentricity and it is based on a parameter control loop that iteratively numerically evolves the system, fits the orbit with analytical post-Newtonian equations, and calculates updated input parameters. Through SpEC numerical simulations, we demonstrate $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ and $O(\rm degree)$ convergence for the orbital eccentricity and the spin directions respectively in $\leq7$ iterations. These tests extend to binaries with mass ratios $q \leq 3$, eccentricities $e \leq 0.65$, and spin magnitudes $|\chi | \leq 0.75$. Our method for controlling the orbital and spin parameters of numerical simulations can be used to produce targeted simulations in sparsely covered regions of the parameter space or study the dynamics of relativistic binaries.</description>

      <title>Complexity factor for a static self-gravitating sphere in Rastall-Rainbow gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalized Herrera's definition of complexity factor for static spherically symmetric fluid distributions to Rastall-Rainbow theory of gravity. For this purpose, an energy-dependent equation of motion is employed in accordance with the principle of gravity's rainbow. It is found that the complexity factor appears in the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann curvature tensor, and measures the deviation of the value of the active gravitational mass from the simplest system under the combined corrections of Rastall and rainbow. In the low-energy limit, all the results we have obtained reduce to the counterparts of general relativity when the non-conserved parameter is taken to be one. We also demonstrate how to build an anisotropic or isotropic star model using complexity approach. In particular, the vanishing complexity factor condition in Rastall-Rainbow gravity is exactly the same as that derived in general relativity. This fact may imply a deeper geometric foundation for the complexity factor.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes. Using the Poincar\'{e} section, fast Lyapunov exponent indicator, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction, we present the effects of the swirling parameter and the spin parameter on the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles, and confirm the presence of chaos in the motion of particles in this background spacetime. We find that the swirling parameter can change the range of the spin parameter where the chaos occurs, and vice versa. Moreover, we observe clearly that, regardless of the spin parameter, there exist some self-similar fractal fine structures in the basins boundaries of attractors for the spacetime of a black hole immersed in swirling universes. The combination the swirling parameter and the spin parameter provides richer physics in the motion of particles.</description>

      <title>Short-Hair Black Holes and the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singularity problem has always been a focus of physicists' research. In order to solve this problem, Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture, but verifying this conjecture in different situations still faces many challenges. In the context of short-hair black hole research, this paper explores whether the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (SCCC) is obeyed by the universe when it is disturbed by a scalar field. In this paper, we explore whether the short-hair black hole satisfies the SCCC under scalar field perturbations. Using the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the WKB approximation method within the framework of general relativity, we systematically analyze the behavior of short-hair black holes under different parameter conditions. The focus is on whether violations of the SCCC occur when the black hole approaches extremal conditions. The results show that when the charge Q of the short-hair black hole approaches its extremal value, the SCCC is violated. However, as the order k of the black hole's metric equation and the angular momentum quantum number l increase, the phenomenon of SCCC violation is delayed. These findings indicate that the proximity of the black hole's charge Q to extremality, as well as the values of the angular momentum quantum number l and the order k, play crucial roles in exploring black hole physics and verifying the SCCC. This research not only reveals the behavior of short-hair black holes under extreme conditions but also provides a new perspective for further investigation of the SCCC.</description>

      <title>Inter--disks inversion surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a counter--rotating torus orbiting a central Kerr black hole (\textbf{BH}) with dimensionless spin $a$, and its accretion flow into the \textbf{BH}, in an agglomerate of an outer counter--rotating torus and an inner co--rotating torus. This work focus is the analysis of the inter--disks inversion surfaces. Inversion surfaces are spacetime surfaces, defined by the condition $u^{\phi}=0$ on the flow torodial velocity, located out of the \textbf{BH} ergoregion, and totally embedding the \textbf{BH}. They emerge as a necessary condition, related to the spacetime frame--dragging, for the counter--rotating flows into the central Kerr \textbf{BH}. In our analysis we study the inversion surfaces of the Kerr spacetimes for the counter--rotating flow from the outer torus, impacting on the inner co--rotating disk. Being totally or partially embedded in (internal to) the inversion surfaces, the inner co--rotating torus (or jet) could be totally or in part ``shielded", respectively, from the impact with flow with $a u^{\phi}&lt;0$. We prove that, in general, in the spacetimes with $a&lt;0.551$ the co--rotating toroids are always external to the accretion flows inversion surfaces. For $0.551&lt;a&lt;0.886$, co--rotating toroids could be partially internal (with the disk inner region, including the inner edge) in the flow inversion surface. For \textbf{BHs} with $a&gt;0.886$, a co--rotating torus could be entirely embedded in the inversion surface and, for larger spins, it is internal to the inversion surfaces. Tori orbiting in the \textbf{BH} outer ergoregion are a particular case. Further constraints on the \textbf{BHs} spins are discussed in the article.</description>

      <title>Lowering the strong coupling mode of modified teleparallel gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the strong coupling problem in modified teleparallel gravity theories using the effective field theory (EFT) approach, demonstrating that it is possible to shift the emergence of new degrees of freedom (DoFs) to lower orders in perturbation theory. We first focus on the case of $f(T)$ gravity, and we show that in its conformally equivalent form the scalar perturbations are non-dynamical up to the cubic action. We then propose a simple modification of the theory, which lowers the appearance of new DoFs to cubic order, compared to the quartic order in standard $f(T)$ gravity. Our work opens a new avenue to address the issue of strong coupling in modified teleparallel gravity, and suggests a new classification scheme of these theories based on the perturbative order at which new DoFs appear.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical effects on the mass function of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ begin the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Ellipsoidal Primordial Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Quadratic Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The induced conservative tidal response of self-gravitating objects in general relativity is parametrized in terms of a set of coefficients, which are commonly referred to as Love numbers. For asymptotically-flat black holes in four spacetime dimensions, the Love numbers are notoriously zero in the static regime. In this work, we show that this result continues to hold upon inclusion of nonlinearities in the theory for Schwarzschild black holes. We first solve the quadratic Einstein equations in the static limit to all orders in the multipolar expansion, including both even and odd perturbations. We show that the second-order solutions take simple analytic expressions, generically expressible in the form of finite polynomials. We then define the quadratic Love numbers at the level of the point-particle effective field theory. By performing the matching with the full solution in general relativity, we show that quadratic Love number coefficients are zero to all orders in the derivative expansion, like the linear ones.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black holes in the full subextremal range $|a|&lt;M$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global existence, boundedness and decay for small data solutions $\psi$ to a general class of quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black hole backgrounds in the full sub-extremal range $|a|&lt;M$. The method extends our previous [DHRT22], which considered such equations on a wide class of background spacetimes, including Kerr, but restricted in that case to the very slowly rotating regime $|a|\ll M$ (which may be treated simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild $a=0$). To handle the general $|a|&lt;M$ case, our present proof is based on two ingredients: (i) the linear inhomogeneous estimates on Kerr backgrounds proven in [DRSR16], further refined however in order to gain a derivative in elliptic frequency regimes, and (ii) the existence of appropriate physical space currents satisfying degenerate coercivity properties, but which now must be tailored to a finite number of wave packets defined by suitable frequency projection. The above ingredients can be thought of as adaptations of the two basic ingredients of [DHRT22], exploiting however the peculiarities of the Kerr geometry. The novel frequency decomposition in (ii), inspired by the boundedness arguments of [DR11, DRSR16], is defined using only azimuthal and stationary frequencies, and serves both to separate the superradiant and non-superradiant parts of the solution and to localise trapping to small regions of spacetime. The strengthened (i), on the other hand, allows us to relax the required coercivity properties of our wave-packet dependent currents, so as in particular to accept top order errors provided that they are localised to the elliptic frequency regime. These error terms are analysed with the help of the full Carter separation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes within the framework of non-commutative geometry. By solving the Einstein's equations, we derive the corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentzian distribution and analyze the thermodynamics. Our results confirm that the inclusion of the black hole's mass in the energy-momentum tensor violates the traditional first law of black hole thermodynamics. The study of criticality reveals that the black hole undergoes a small black hole-large black hole phase transition similar to that of the Van der Waals system, with a critical point and a critical ratio slightly smaller than that of the van der Waals fluid. As the non-commutative parameter increases, the phase transition process shortens, leading to a critical point, and ultimately to the disappearance of the phase transition. The violation of the traditional first law of thermodynamics results in a discontinuity of the Gibbs free energy during the smaller black hole-large black hole phase transition, indicating the occurrence of zeroth-order phase transition. We also examine the Joule-Thomson process, calculating the inversion points and determining the minimum inversion mass and the minimum inversion temperature.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as probes of the late-time universe: a new insight on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events, a subset of which have been localized to their host galaxies. Their high dispersion measures offer valuable insights into the ionized plasma along their line of sight, enabling them to serve as probes of cosmological parameters. One of the major challenges in contemporary cosmology is the Hubble tension -- an unresolved discrepancy between two independent methods of determining the Universe's expansion rate, yielding differing values for the Hubble constant. In this study, we analyze a sample of 64 extragalactic, localized FRBs observed by various telescopes, employing Bayesian analysis with distinct likelihood functions. Our findings suggest that FRBs serve as tracers of the Hubble constant in the late-time Universe. Notably, our results exhibit smaller error bars compared to previous studies, and the derived Hubble constant with 1$\sigma$ error bars no longer overlap with those obtained from early-Universe measurements. These results underscore the continuing tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Foundational Issues in Dynamical Casimir Effect and Analogue Features in Cosmological Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving mirrors as analogue sources of Hawking radiation from black holes have been explored extensively, less so with cosmological particle creation (CPC), even though the analogy between dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) and CPC based on the mechanism of parametric amplification of quantum field fluctuations has also been known for a long time. This `perspective' essay intends to convey some of the rigor and thoroughness of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, which serves as the theoretical foundation of CPC, to DCE, which enjoys a variety of active experimental explorations. We have selected out seven issues of relevance to address, starting from the naively simple ones, e.g., why should one be bothered with `curved' spacetime when performing a laboratory experiment in ostensibly flat space, to foundational theoretical ones, such as the frequent appearance of nonlocal dissipation in the system dynamics induced by colored noises in its field environment, the existence of quantum Lenz law and fluctuation-dissipation relations in the backreaction effects of DCE emission on the moving atom/mirror or the source, and the construction of a microphysics model to account for the dynamical responses of a mirror or medium. The strengthening of theoretical ground for DCE is useful not only for improving conceptual clarity but needed for the development of proof of concept type of future experimental designs for DCE. Results from DCE experiments in turn will enrich our understanding of quantum field effects in the early universe because they are, in the spirit of analogue gravity, our best hopes for the verification of these fundamental processes.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Gravitational Vector Modes and their Magnetogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we provide an overview of the physics of colliding black holes and neutron stars and of the impact of neutrinos on these systems. Observations of colliding neutron stars play an important role in nuclear astrophysics today. They allow us to study the properties of cold nuclear matter and the origin of many heavy elements (gold, platinum, uranium). We show that neutrinos significantly impact the observable signals powered by these events as well as the outcome of nucleosynthesis in the matter that they eject into the surrounding intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Quantum of action in entangled relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate that the novel general theory of relativity, named `Entangled Relativity', is more economical than General Relativity in terms of universal dimensionful constants when both theories are considered through a path integral formulation. The sole parameter of Entangled Relativity is a quantum of energy squared. However, in order to recover standard Quantum Field Theory when gravity is neglected in the path integral, we show that this quantum of energy corresponds to the reduced Planck energy. But this result also implies that Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and Newton's constant $G$ are not fixed constants in this framework but vary proportionally to a gravitational scalar degree of freedom, akin to typical scalar-tensor and $f(R)$ theories. In particular, it is derived that $\hbar$ is proportional to $G$ in this framework. This establishes an explicit connection between the quantum and gravitational realms. Given the absence of a free parameter in the theory, we argue that this unique prediction can likely be probed observationally in the future. Furthermore, due to the deficit of dimensionful parameters in Entangled Relativity compared to standard physics, fundamental length or time scales cannot be defined within this framework. We argue that this aspect is expected to become significant in the non-perturbative quantum gravity regime of the theory.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes with applications to Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove global existence and decay for small-data solutions to a class of quasilinear wave equations on a wide variety of asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds, allowing in particular for the presence of horizons, ergoregions and trapped null geodesics, and including as a special case the Schwarzschild and very slowly rotating $\vert a \vert \ll M$ Kerr family of black holes in general relativity. There are two distinguishing aspects of our approach. The first aspect is its dyadically localised nature: The nontrivial part of the analysis is reduced entirely to time-translation invariant $r^p$-weighted estimates, in the spirit of [DR09], to be applied on dyadic time-slabs which for large $r$ are outgoing. Global existence and decay then both immediately follow by elementary iteration on consecutive such time-slabs, without further global bootstrap. The second, and more fundamental, aspect is our direct use of a "blackbox" linear inhomogeneous energy estimate on exactly stationary metrics, together with a novel but elementary physical space top order identity that need not capture the structure of trapping and is robust to perturbation. In the specific example of Kerr black holes, the required linear inhomogeneous estimate can then be quoted directly from the literature [DRSR16], while the additional top order physical space identity can be shown easily in many cases (we include in the Appendix a proof for the Kerr case $\vert a \vert \ll M$, which can in fact be understood in this context simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild). In particular, the approach circumvents the need either for producing a purely physical space identity capturing trapping or for a careful analysis of the commutation properties of frequency projections with the wave operator of time-dependent metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled quintessence cosmological model in which a dark-energy scalar field with an exponential potential interacts directly with a dark-matter fluid through a dissipative term inspired by warm inflation. The evolution equations of this model give rise to a three-dimensional dynamical system for which a thorough qualitative analysis is performed for all values of the relevant parameters. We find that the model is able to replicate the observed sequence of late-time cosmological eras, namely, a long enough matter-dominated era followed by a present era of accelerated expansion. In situations where there is a significant transfer of energy from dark energy to dark matter, temporary scaling-type solutions may arise, but, asymptotically, all solutions are dominated by dark energy.</description>

      <title>A unified-description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity of the metric-affine geometry with the M\"{o}bius representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical fundamentals for a unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity 2-forms in the way extending the so-called M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group, which is the method to convert the semi-direct product into the ordinary matrix product, to revive the fertility of gauge theories of gravity. First of all, we illustrate the basic concepts for constructing the metric-affine geometry. Then the curvature and torsion 2-forms are described in a unified manner by using the Cartan connection of the M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group. In this unified-description, the curvature and torsion are derived by Cartan's structure equation with respect to a common connection 1-form. After that, extending the M\"{o}bius representation, the dilation and shear 2-forms, or equivalently, the non-metricity 2-form, are introduced in the same unified manner. Based on the unified-description established in this paper, introducing a new group parametrization and applying the In\"{o}n\"{u}-Wigner group contraction to the full theory, the relationships among symmetries, geometric quantities, and geometries are investigated with respect to the three gauge groups: the metric-affine group and its extension, and an extension of the (anti)-de Sitter group in which the non-metricity exists. Finally, possible applications to theories of gravity are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of avoiding cosmological singularity with a bounce solution in the early Universe. The main finding is that simple and well-known semiclassical correction, which describes the mixing of radiation and gravity in the effective action, may provide an analytic solution with a bounce. The solution requires a positive beta function for the total radiation term and the contraction of the Universe at the initial instant. The numerical estimate shows that the bounce may occur in an acceptable range of energies, but only under strong assumptions about the particle physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves that, in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime manifold, one can consider coordinate transformations expressed by fractional linear maps which give rise to isometries and make it possible to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The projective boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes are studied with our projective method. Since the kinds of infinity here defined depend only on the symmetry of interest in a spacetime manifold, they have a broad range of applications, which motivate the innovative analysis of Schwarzschild, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Mapping eccentricity evolutions between numerical relativity and effective-one-body gravitational waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital eccentricity in compact binaries is considered to be a key tracer of their astrophysical origin, and can be inferred from gravitational-wave observations due to its imprint on the emitted signal. For a robust measurement, accurate waveform models are needed. However, ambiguities in the definition of eccentricity can obfuscate the physical meaning and result in seemingly discrepant measurements. In this work we present a suite of 28 new numerical relativity simulations of eccentric, aligned-spin binary black holes with mass ratios between 1 and 6 and initial post-Newtonian eccentricities between 0.05 and 0.3. We then develop a robust pipeline for measuring the eccentricity evolution as a function of frequency from gravitational-wave observables that is applicable even to signals that span at least $\gtrsim 7$ orbits. We assess the reliability of our procedure and quantify its robustness under different assumptions on the data. Using the eccentricity measured at the first apastron, we initialise effective-one-body waveforms and quantify how the precision in the eccentricity measurement, and therefore the choice of the initial conditions, impacts the agreement with the numerical data. We find that even small deviations in the initial eccentricity can lead to non-negligible differences in the phase and amplitude of the waveforms. However, we demonstrate that we can reliably map the eccentricities between the simulation data and analytic models, which is crucial for robustly building eccentric hybrid waveforms, and to improve the accuracy of eccentric waveform models in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Time-Machines Construct in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{A},A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$ and $f(\mathcal{R})$ Modified Gravity Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, our objective is to explore a time-machine space-time formulated in general relativity, as introduced by Li (Phys. Rev. D {\bf 59}, 084016 (1999)), within the context of modified gravity theories. We consider Ricci-inverse gravity of all Classes of models, {\it i.e.}, (i) Class-{\bf I}: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A})=(\mathcal{R}+{\kappa\,\mathcal{R}^2}+\beta\,\mathcal{A})$, (ii) Class-{\bf II}: $f(\mathcal{R}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+{\kappa\,\mathcal{R}^2}+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$ model, and (iii) Class-{\bf III}: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}{\kappa\,\mathcal{R}^2}+\beta\,\mathcal{A}+\delta\,\mathcal{A}^2+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$ model, where $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor, the reciprocal of the Ricci tensor, $R_{\mu\nu}$, $\mathcal{A}=g_{\mu\nu}\,A^{\mu\nu}$ is its scalar, and $\beta, {\kappa}, \gamma, \delta$ are the coupling constants. Moreover, we consider $f(\mathcal{R})$ modified gravity theory and investigate the same time-machine space-time. In fact, we show that Li time-machine space-time serve as valid solutions both in Ricci-inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$ modified gravity theories. Thus, both theory allows the formation of closed time-like curves analogue to general relativity, thereby representing a possible time-machine model in these gravity theories theoretically.</description>

      <title>Landauer's principle and black hole area quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently in the saturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spacetime constructed from a contact manifold with a degenerate metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional spacetime using a three-dimensional contact manifold equipped with a degenerate metric. The degenerate metric is set to be compatible with the contact structure. The compatibility condition is defined in this paper. Our construction yields a Ricci tensor of a particularly simple form, which leads to a solution of the Einstein equation with a null dust and cosmic strings. The solution includes two arbitrary functions: the energy density of the null dust and the number density of the cosmic strings. When there exist the cosmic strings, the spacetime is of Petrov type D. Otherwise, the spacetime is conformally flat. For some simple matter densities, we examine the Einstein equation in detail.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two types of static black hole models that retain general covariance have been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG). We have studied the light rings and shadows of these black holes using the topological method and the backward ray-tracing method, respectively. We demonstrate that these light rings in both types of static black holes are standard and unstable according to the classification of light rings. Subsequently, we checked the position of the light rings using the photon trajectory equation. We found that although the quantum parameters do not affect the light rings of these two types of black holes, they do reduce the size of the first type of static black hole in EQG, making it smaller. However, for the second type of static black hole in EQG, we cannot distinguish it from a Schwarzschild black hole based on the shadow alone. Fortunately, the quantum parameters shrink the lensing rings of both types of black holes in EQG, causing the black hole shadow to occupy a larger proportion within the ring. This can serve as a basis for distinguishing whether the black hole is in EQG or general relativity (GR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a wormhole construction in the framework of the $f(R,T)$ extended gravity theory, with $R$ being the Ricci curvature scalar and $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, in the case in which the energy-momentum tensor is conserved. From the conservation equation we find that the $f(R,T)$ function is linear in $T$. By developing the field equations, we find a traversable wormhole that for a range of the model parameter values, has no need to be filled by exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Temperatures of AdS$_2$ black holes and holography revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04427v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a dilaton gravity model, we revisit the calculation of the temperature of an evaporating black hole that is initially formed by a shock wave, taking into account the quantum backreaction. Based on the holographic principle, along with the assumption of a boundary equation of motion, we show that the black hole energy is maintained for a while during the early stage of evaporation. Gradually, it decreases as time goes on and eventually vanishes. Thus, the Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes. It is also shown that the maximum temperature of the evaporating black hole never exceeds the Hawking temperature of the eternal AdS$_{2}$ black hole. We discuss physical implications of the initial zero temperature of the evaporating black hole.</description>

Abstract: We consider gas of massless fermions at certain temperature T and acceleration a. We find a second order phase transition at temperature T approaching the Unruh temperature TU. The implications for hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions (HIC) and for black-hole physics are discussed. In particular, this novel phase transition may be associated with thermalization in HIC, indicating its analogy with falling into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Everpresent $\Lambda$ (II): Cosmological Tests of Current Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Everpresent $\Lambda$, a stochastic dark energy model motivated by causal set theory and unimodular gravity, and confronts it with two key observational data sets, Supernova Ia (SN Ia) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. A key feature of this model is that $\Lambda$ fluctuates over time and on average the magnitude of its fluctuations is of the order of the dominant energy density (be it radiation or matter) for the given epoch. In particular, we focus on a phenomenological implementation of Everpresent $\Lambda$ known as Model 1. The random fluctuations in Everpresent $\Lambda$ realizations are generated using seed numbers, and we find that for a small fraction of seeds Model 1 is capable of producing realizations that fit SN Ia data better than $\Lambda$CDM. We further investigate what features distinguish these realizations from the more general behaviour, and find that the "good'' realizations have relatively small fluctuations at low redshifts ($z&lt;1.5$), which do not closely track the matter density. We find that Model 1 struggles to improve on $\Lambda$CDM at describing the CMB data. However, by suppressing the values of $\Lambda$ near the last scattering surface, as suggested in arXiv:1703.06265, we find a large improvement in the best fit of the model, though still with a $\chi^2$ value much larger than that of $\Lambda$CDM. We also study the allowed variation of the dark energy density by the CMB constraints in a more model-independent manner, and find that some variation (especially prior to recombination) is possible and in fact can lead to improvement over $\Lambda$CDM and reduce the Hubble tension, in line with some early dark energy proposals. However, for the kinds of variations considered, the favoured fluctuations are smaller in magnitude than is typical in current Everpresent $\Lambda$ models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic bound on slow-roll parameter in stringy quintessence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the late time behavior of the scalar part of the volume modulus and the dilaton in stringy quintessence model, focusing on their contributions to the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ which directly measures the deviation of the spacetime geometry from de Sitter space. When only one of the moduli is allowed to move, $\epsilon$ converges to the stable fixed point at late time. The fixed point value is larger than $1$, thus the slow-roll cannot be realized. Moreover, if the decay rate of the quintessence potential is larger than some critical value, the positivity of the potential imposes that the stable fixed point value is just given by $3$, independent of the details of the moduli dynamics. Otherwise, the fixed point value coincides with the potential slow-roll parameter. When both the volume modulus and the dilaton roll down the potential simultaneously, we can find the relation between the contributions of two moduli to $\epsilon$ satisfied at the fixed point. In this case, the fixed point value is not in general the simple sum of fixed point values in the single field case and cannot be larger than $3$.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Classification and Parameter Inference of Rotational Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test deep-learning (DL) techniques for the analysis of rotational core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) gravitational-wave (GW) signals by performing classification and parameter inference of the maximum (peak) frequency and the GW strain amplitude ($\Delta h$) multiplied by the luminosity distance ($D$) attained at core bounce, respectively, $(f_{peak})$ and $(D \cdot \Delta h)$. Our datasets are built from a catalog of numerically generated CCSN waveforms assembled by Richers et al. 2017. Those waveforms are injected into noise from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory and Advanced Virgo detectors corresponding to the O2 and O3a observing runs. For a network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above 5, our classification network using time series detects Galactic CCSN GW signals buried in detector noise with a false positive rate of 0.10% and a 98% accuracy, being able to detect all signals with SNR&gt;10. The inference of $f_{peak}$ is more accurate than for $D \cdot \Delta h $, particularly for our datasets with the shortest time window (0.25 s) and for a minimum SNR=15. From the calibration plots of predicted versus true values of the two parameters, the standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the slope deviation with respect to the ideal value are computed. We find $\sigma_{D \cdot \Delta h} = 52.6$ cm and $\sigma_{f_{peak}} = 18.3$ Hz, with respective slope deviations of 11.6% and 8.3%. Our best model is also tested on waveforms from a recent CCSN catalog built by Mitra et al. 2023, different from the one used for the training. For these new waveforms, the true values of the two parameters are mostly within the $1\sigma$ band around the network's predicted values. Our results show that DL techniques hold promise to infer physical parameters of Galactic rotational CCSN events.</description>

      <title>Accretion tori around rotating neutron stars II: Oscillations and precessions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The four characteristic oscillation frequencies of accretion flows are, in addition to the Keplerian orbital frequency, often discussed in the context of the time variability of the black hole and neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). These are namely the frequencies of the axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations, and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric oscillations corresponding to the periastron (radial) and Lense-Thirring (vertical) precessions. In this context, we investigate the effect of the quadrupole moment of a slowly rotating NS and provide complete formulae for calculating these oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their convenient approximations. Simple formulae corresponding to the geodesic limit of a slender torus (and test particle motion) and the limit of a marginally overflowing torus (torus exhibiting a critical cusp) are presented, and furthermore, more general approximate formulae are included to allow calculations for arbitrarily thick tori. We provide the Wolfram Mathematica code used for our calculations together with C++ and PYTHON codes for calculations of the frequencies. Our formulae can be used for various calculations describing the astrophysical signatures of the NSs' superdense matter equation of state. For instance, we demonstrate that, even for a given fixed number of free parameters, a model accounting for fluid flow precession better matches the frequencies of twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations observed in NS LMXBs than a model using geodesic precession.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>
