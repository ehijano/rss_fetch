      <title>Measurement and Modeling on Terahertz Channel Propagation Through Vegetation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz band offers promising opportunities for high-capacity wireless communications but faces significant challenges from vegetation-induced channel impairments. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of THz channel propagation through vegetation, introducing a hybrid modeling approach that combines deterministic vegetation dependent exponential decay modeling with statistical characterization of temporal variations. Through extensive laboratory measurements using Epipremnum aureum, we find that vegetation introduces angular-dependent power losses, with channel statistics following heavy tailed Stable distributions rather than conventional Rician or Weibull models. Our outdoor measurements with dense and sparse lilac scenarios reveal pronounced seasonal variations in attenuation and height-dependent effects, while validating the VED model's ability to maintain excellent agreement with measured data and parameter stability across different heights. Critical bit error rate analysis uncovers distinct SNR thresholds beyond which performance exhibits oscillatory behavior due to heavy-tailed fading, with significant implications for modulation scheme selection and power control strategies in practical THz communication systems.</description>

      <title>Sand Inclusion Composite Structures for Enhanced Ballistic Impact Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising threat of ballistic impacts, it is critical to devise a solution that is both efficient and economical. Recently, Polymer Matrix Sand Composites (PMSCs) have emerged as a viable cost-effective option. This ongoing research focuses on providing stronger protection against diverse ballistic impacts. The study examines the enhancement of ballistic resistance in PMSCs through the graded incorporation of sand. Variable properties are achieved along the thickness by altering the sand particle size and weight fraction in the polymer matrix. The gradation creates a stepwise structure, starting with a dense base impact zone containing abrasive sand particles with a typical size range. This layer is brittle and hard, effectively eroding incoming projectiles. Subsequent layers are less dense, offering tensile strength that reflects stress waves and reduces impact energy while supporting the frontal brittle zone. The minimally dense or neat matrix regions prevent backlash and provide a cushioning effect. The addition of sand particles increases the composite's surface area, enhancing adhesion between inclusions and the matrix. This improved adhesion ensures efficient load transfer, increasing overall hardness. PMSCs were fabricated to analyze the effects of two matrix compositions, and refining manufacturing methods. These composites were subjected to tensile testing, Izod impact testing, Shore-D hardness testing, and other evaluations to assess their mechanical properties. The findings show that varying the sand content significantly impacts mechanical properties up to an optimal weight fraction for a given size range of inclusions. Experimental and simulation studies were employed to extract properties and evaluate material behavior under ballistic threats. The research underscores the potential of PMSCs as affordable and sustainable composites for advanced ballistic protection.</description>

      <title>Local Detection of Enhanced Hot Electron Scattering in InSb/CdTe Heterostructure Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The InSb/CdTe heterojunction structure, characterized by low effective mass and high electron mobility, exhibits interfacial energy band bending, leading to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling effect and nonreciprocal transport, which makes its suitable for spintronic devices with broad applications in logic and storage fields. However, the complex heterojunction interfaces of InSb/CdTe, composed of group III-V and group II-VI semiconductors, are prone to interdiffusion. Therefore, characterization and study of the interfacial properties of InSb/CdTe heterojunctions are crucial for the growth improvement of the InSb/CdTe material system as well as its application in the field of spintronics. In this study, a novel scanning probe microscope, called a scanning noise microscope, was applied to visualize hot electron scattering in InSb/CdTe nano-devices. The results demonstrated that the near-field signal originates from the Coulomb scattering of charged ions on electrons at the interface of the embedded layer heterojunction. This real-space, nondestructive characterization of the heterojunction interface properties offers a new tool for enhancing the performance of heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Edge modes in modulated metamaterials based on the three-gap theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new paradigm for generating complex structured materials based on the three-gap theorem that unifies and generalises several key concepts in the study of localised edge states. Our model has both the discretised coupling strengths of the SSH model and a modulation parameter that can be used to characterise the spectral flow of edge modes and produce images reminiscent of the Hofstadter butterfly. By defining a localisation factor associated to each eigenmode, we are able to establish conditions for the existence of localised edge states in finite systems. This allows us to compare their eigenfrequencies with the spectra of the corresponding infinitely periodic problem and characterise the rich pattern of localised edge modes appearing and disappearing (in the sense of becoming delocalised) as the parameters of our three-gap algorithm are varied.</description>

      <title>Development of an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller using Neural Networks for Trajectory Tracking of a Cylindrical Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cylindrical manipulators are extensively used in industrial automation, especially in emerging technologies like 3D printing, which represents a significant future trend. However, controlling the trajectory of nonlinear models with system uncertainties remains a critical challenge, often leading to reduced accuracy and reliability. To address this, the study develops an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC) integrated with Neural Networks (NNs) to improve trajectory tracking for cylindrical manipulators. The ASMC leverages the robustness of sliding mode control and the adaptability of neural networks to handle uncertainties and dynamic variations effectively. Simulation results validate that the proposed ASMC-NN achieves high trajectory tracking accuracy, fast response time, and enhanced reliability, making it a promising solution for applications in 3D printing and beyond.</description>

      <title>Optimize the parameters of the PID Controller using Genetic Algorithm for Robot Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with optimized parameters for a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to optimize the controller parameters, addressing the challenges in determining PID controller parameters for highly nonlinear systems like robotic arms compared to traditional methods. The GA-optimized PID controller significantly improves control accuracy and performance over traditional control methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the robotic arm system operates with high precision and stability. Additionally, the shortened trajectory tracking response time enhances the feasibility of applying this control algorithm in realworld scenarios. This research not only confirms the suitability of PID-GA for robotic arms and similar systems but also opens new avenues for applying this algorithm to real physical systems.</description>

      <title>Photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) system based on silicon photonic device. Our DLA system employs guided electromagnetic waves as a primary energy source, modulated to inject into the electron-light interaction region to accelerate or modulate electron beams and recycled the energy for the next round-trip. Long-distance acceleration takes place as electrons interact with the pre-modulated light field. Our loop recycles post-interaction light field, enabling photons reuse across successive cycles. To optimize the interaction process, we developed an adaptive algorithm to refine waveguide structures, and identified an "optimal waveguide accelerator" with superior performance on our dataset. We find that the optimized DLA loop only requires low-power light injection to sufficiently sustain high acceleration gradients for continuous electron beams. Under optimal electron beam intensity, the system achieves exceptionally high photon utilization, ensuring that nearly all injected light power transferred to electrons. Using spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal waveguide also operates as an electron energy filter, selecting and manipulating phase-matched electrons over a broad energy range, even for quantum electron wavefunction shaping. Our photon-recycling DLA setup is not only suitable for low-energy beam accelerators, but also offers versatility as a beam filter or a narrow energy selection combined with other optical elements, the total setup can be further applied to explore free electron quantum optics engaging with the advancing field of photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Vibration Motors to Develop Miniature Untethered Robotic Fishes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniature underwater robots play a crucial role in the exploration and development of marine resources, particularly in confined spaces and high-pressure deep-sea environments. This study presents the design, optimization, and performance of a miniature robotic fish, powered by the oscillation of bio-inspired fins. These fins feature a rigid-flexible hybrid structure and use an eccentric rotating mass (ERM) vibration motor as the excitation source to generate high-frequency unidirectional oscillations that induce acoustic streaming for propulsion. The drive mechanism, powered by miniature ERM vibration motors, eliminates the need for complex mechanical drive systems, enabling complete isolation of the entire drive system from the external environment and facilitating the miniaturization of the robotic fish. A compact, untethered robotic fish, measuring 85*60*45 mm^3, is equipped with three bio-inspired fins located at the pectoral and caudal positions. Experimental results demonstrate that the robotic fish achieves a maximum forward swimming speed of 1.36 body lengths (BL) per second powered by all fins and minimum turning radius of 0.6 BL when powered by a single fin. These results underscore the significance of employing the ERM vibration motor in advancing the development of highly maneuverable, miniature untethered underwater robots for various marine exploration tasks.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger edge modes for water waves in linear and nonlinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper experimentally investigates topologically protected edge modes in a water wave channel through a direct geometric mapping to the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. By designing a periodic channel with alternating widths, we replicate the key features of the SSH model, leading to the emergence of robust zero-energy sloshing edge modes localized at the boundaries. Experimental data show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, supported by two-dimensional numerical simulations. In the nonlinear regime, two distinct bifurcations are observed, indicating the appearance of secondary resonances. This study highlights the relevance of the SSH model for water wave systems and provides an accessible method to explore topological edge states in classical wave systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scalable excitation platform for nanophotonic emitters using individually addressable micro-LED-on-CMOS arrays is demonstrated for the first time. Heterogeneous integration by transfer-printing of semiconductor nanowires was used for the deterministic assembly of the infrared emitters embedded in polymer optical waveguides with high yield and positional accuracy. Direct optical pumping of these emitters is demonstrated using micro-LED pixels as source, with optical modulation (on-off keying) measured up to 150 MHz. A micro-LED-on-CMOS array of pump sources were employed to demonstrate individual control of multiple waveguide coupled nanowire emitters in parallel, paving the way for future large scale photonic integrated circuit applications.</description>

      <title>Holographic Metasurfaces Enabling Wave Computing for 6G: Status Overview, Challenges, and Future Research Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in wave computing using metasurfaces are poised to transform wireless communications by enabling high-speed, energy-efficient, and highly parallelized signal processing. These capabilities are essential to meet the ultra-high data rates of up to 1 terabit per second and minimal latency as low as 1 millisecond required by next-generation wireless networks. Diverging from traditional digital processing, wave computing adopts continuous analog signals to foster innovative functions such as over-the-air computation, integrated sensing and communications, computational electromagnetic imaging, and physical-layer security. This article explores the potential of reconfigurable multi-functional metasurfaces in wave computing, emphasizing their pivotal role in facilitating seamless communications and addressing the escalating computational demands for sixth generation (6G) networks. As artificial intelligence has become one of the most prominent and rapidly advancing fields of research over the last decade, we also introduce a wave-domain-based machine learning approach aimed at achieving power-efficient, fast training and computation. Future research directions are discussed, underscoring how metasurface-based systems can merge computation with communication to innovate components of 6G networks, thus creating smarter, faster, and more adaptable wireless infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Measurement of surface tension coefficients of liquids based on equal thickness interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface tension coefficient is a key parameter in fluid mechanics. The conventional method to measure it is to determine the critical surface tension that causes the rupture of a liquid film. However, this method has a large error because the surface tension coefficient is very sensitive to environmental factors. In this paper, we propose a new method based on equal thickness interference to study the mathematical model of the stationary liquid surface shape and measure it by the interference technique. This method enables the accurate measurement of the liquid surface tension coefficient. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has the advantages of high accuracy, low cost, and simple instrumentation. The maximum measurement error is less than 3.1\%. Moreover, this method can be applied to measure the liquid-liquid interfacial tension, which has a good application prospect.</description>

      <title>Dilated space-and-wavelength selective crosspoint optical switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated switches that are both space and wavelength selective are a highly promising technology for data-intensive applications as they benefit from multi-dimensional manipulation of optical signals. However, scaling these switches normally poses stringent challenges such as increased fabrication complexity and control difficulties, due to the growing number of switching elements. In this work, we propose a new type of dilated crosspoint topology, which efficiently handles both space and wavelength selective switching, while reducing the required switching element count by an order of magnitude compared to reported designs. To the best of our knowledge, our design requires the fewest switching elements for an equivalent routing paths number and it fully cancels the first-order in-band crosstalk. We demonstrate such an ultra-compact space-and-wavelength-selective switch (SWSS) at a scale of $4\times 4\times 4\lambda$ on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Experimental results reveal that the switch achieves an insertion loss ranging from 2.3 dB to 8.6 dB and crosstalk levels in between -35.3 dB and -59.7 dB. The add-drop microring-resonators (MRRs) are equipped with micro-heaters, exhibiting a rise and fall time of 46 $\mu$s and 0.33 $\mu$s, respectively. These performance characteristics highlight the switch's ultra-low element count and crosstalk with low insertion loss, making it a promising candidate for advanced data center applications.</description>

      <title>Electron transverse transport enhancement by composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.</description>
