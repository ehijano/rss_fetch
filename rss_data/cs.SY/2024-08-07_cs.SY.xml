      <title>Electricity Market-Clearing With Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events jeopardize power network operations, causing beyond-design failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. With the increasing deployment of renewable generation, electric power systems become increasingly dependent on weather changes. Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address this research and practice gap, we propose efficiently managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through the integration of large deviation theory into chance constraints (LDT-CC). We integrate extreme event statistics into market-clearing, via including LDT-CC to model and price reserve to cope with extreme events, and use weighted chance constraints (WCC) to reduce solution conservatism. We prove that the proposed market design is capable of producing a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed pricing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Control of SIR Epidemics: Sacrificing Optimality for Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of parameter estimation and state measurement errors on a control framework for optimally mitigating the spread of epidemics. We capture the epidemic spreading process using a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) epidemic model and consider isolation as the control strategy. We use a control strategy to remove (isolate) a portion of the infected population. Our goal is to maintain the daily infected population below a certain level, while minimizing the resource captured by the isolation rate. Distinct from existing works on leveraging control strategies in epidemic spreading, we propose a parameter estimation strategy and further characterize the parameter estimation error bound. In order to deal with uncertainties, we propose a robust control strategy by overestimating the seriousness of the epidemic and study the feasibility of the system. Compared to the optimal control strategy, we establish that the proposed strategy under parameter estimation and measurement errors will sacrifice optimality to flatten the curve.</description>

      <title>Active Compensation of Position Dependent Flexible Dynamics in High-Precision Mechatronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing demands in the semiconductor industry necessitate increasingly stringent requirements on throughput and positioning accuracy of lithographic equipment. Meeting these demands involves employing highly aggressive motion profiles, which introduce position-dependent flexible dynamics, thus compromising achievable position tracking performance. This paper introduces a control approach enabling active compensation of position-dependent flexible dynamics by extending the conventional rigid-body control structure to include active control of flexible dynamics. To facilitate real-time implementation of the control algorithm, appropriate position-dependent weighting functions are introduced, ensuring computationally efficient execution of the proposed approach. The efficacy of the proposed control design approach is demonstrated through experiments conducted on a state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wafer stage.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communication for the Metaverse Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of the metaverse and its role in enabling real-time simulation and analysis of real-world counterparts, an increasing number of personalized metaverse scenarios are being created to influence entertainment experiences and social behaviors. However, compared to traditional image and video entertainment applications, the exact transmission of the vast amount of metaverse-associated information significantly challenges the capacity of existing bit-oriented communication networks. Moreover, the current metaverse also witnesses a growing goal shift for transmitting the meaning behind custom-designed content, such as user-designed buildings and avatars, rather than exact copies of physical objects. To meet this growing goal shift and bandwidth challenge, this paper proposes a goal-oriented semantic communication framework for metaverse application (GSCM) to explore and define semantic information through the goal levels. Specifically, we first analyze the traditional image communication framework in metaverse construction and then detail our proposed semantic information along with the end-to-end wireless communication. We then describe the designed modules of the GSCM framework, including goal-oriented semantic information extraction, base knowledge definition, and neural radiance field (NeRF) based metaverse construction. Finally, numerous experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that, compared to image communication, our proposed GSCM framework decreases transmission latency by up to 92.6% and enhances the virtual object operation accuracy and metaverse construction clearance by up to 45.6% and 44.7%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Real-time Event Recognition of Long-distance Distributed Vibration Sensing with Knowledge Distillation and Hardware Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optical fiber vibration sensing (DVS) technology based on phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry is widely used for safety monitoring and intrusion event surveillance in wide-ranging fields. Existing methods rely on deep learning models for event recognition but struggle with real-time processing of large data volumes in long-distance applications. To address these challenges, we use a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). The application of knowledge distillation with ResNet as the teacher model improves the generalization ability of the four-layer CNN, increasing the accuracy from 83.41% to 95.39% on data from untrained environments. The model is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) using a novel design that replaces multiplication with binary shift operations and quantizes model weights accordingly, allowing for high parallelism and low latency. An inference time of 0.083 ms is achieved for a spatial-temporal sample with a 12.5 m fiber length and 0.256 s time frame. This implies the system can process signals over a fiber length of approximately 38.55 km in real time, which is more than twice the capability of a GPU of Nvidia GTX 4090. The proposed method greatly improves the efficiency of vibration pattern recognition, thus promoting the application of DVS as smart sensing system in various areas.

      <title>Self-tuning moving horizon estimation of nonlinear systems via physics-informed machine learning Koopman modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a physics-informed learning-based Koopman modeling approach and present a Koopman-based self-tuning moving horizon estimation design for a class of nonlinear systems. Specifically, we train Koopman operators and two neural networks - the state lifting network and the noise characterization network - using both data and available physical information. The two neural networks account for the nonlinear lifting functions for Koopman modeling and describing system noise distributions, respectively. Accordingly, a stochastic linear Koopman model is established in the lifted space to forecast the dynamic behavior of the nonlinear system. Based on the Koopman model, a self-tuning linear moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme is developed. The weighting matrices of the MHE design are updated using the pre-trained noise characterization network at each sampling instant. The proposed estimation scheme is computationally efficient because only convex optimization is involved during online implementation, and updating the weighting matrices of the MHE scheme does not require re-training the neural networks. We verify the effectiveness and evaluate the performance of the proposed method via the application to a simulated chemical process.</description>

      <title>Improved Tangential Interpolation-based Multi-input Multi-output Modal Analysis of a Full Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Structural Dynamics, modal analysis is the foundation of System Identification and vibration-based inspection. However, despite their widespread use, current state-of-the-art methods for extracting modal parameters from multi-input multi-output (MIMO) frequency domain data are still affected by many technical limitations. Mainly, they can be computationally cumbersome and/or negatively affected by close-in-frequency modes. The Loewner Framework (LF) was recently proposed to alleviate these problems with the limitation of working with single-input data only. This work proposes a computationally improved version of the Lowner Framework, or iLF, to extract modal parameters more efficiently. Also, the proposed implementation is extended in order to handle multi-input multi-output data in the frequency domain. This new implementation is compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the frequency domain implementations of the Least Square Complex Exponential method and the Numerical Algorithm for Subspace State Space System Identification on numerical and experimental datasets. More specifically, a finite element model of a 3D Euler-Bernoulli beam is used for the baseline comparison and the noise robustness verification of the proposed MIMO iLF algorithm. Then, an experimental dataset from MIMO ground vibration tests of a trainer jet aircraft with over 91 accelerometer channels is chosen for the algorithm validation on a real-life application. Excellent results are achieved in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational performance by the proposed improved MIMO method, both on the numerical and the experimental datasets. The MIMO iLF MATLAB implementation is shared in the work supplementary material.</description>

      <title>GAIA -- A Large Language Model for Advanced Power Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power dispatch is essential for providing stable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly electricity to society. However, traditional methods falter as power systems grow in scale and complexity, struggling with multitasking, swift problem-solving, and human-machine collaboration. This paper introduces GAIA, the pioneering Large Language Model (LLM) tailored for power dispatch tasks. We have developed a novel dataset construction technique that harnesses a range of data sources to fine-tune GAIA for optimal performance in this domain. This approach streamlines LLM training, allowing for the seamless integration of multidimensional data in power system management. Additionally, we have crafted specialized prompt strategies to boost GAIA's input-output efficiency in dispatch scenarios. When evaluated on the ElecBench benchmark, GAIA surpasses the baseline model LLaMA2 on multiple metrics. In practical applications, GAIA has demonstrated its ability to enhance decision-making processes, improve operational efficiency, and facilitate better human-machine interactions in power dispatch operations. This paper expands the application of LLMs to power dispatch and validates their practical utility, paving the way for future innovations in this field.</description>

      <title>Distributed Feedback-Feedforward Algorithms for Time-Varying Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address distributed Time-Varying Resource Allocation (TVRA) problem, where the local cost functions, global equality constraint, and Local Feasibility Constraints (LFCs) vary with time. To track the optimal trajectories, algorithms that mimic the structure of feedback-feedforward control systems are proposed. We begin with their conceptual design in the absence of LFCs, developing a feedback-feedforward algorithm that is fixed-time convergent. For cases with LFCs, existing approaches predominantly rely on constructing a time-dependent barrier function, which may impede the design of fixed-time convergent algorithms. Therefore, by exploring the connection between projection and penalty functions, switched feedforward laws are tailored to handle LFCs, with projection used in conjunction. Based on this, we develop a projection-based feedback-feedforward algorithm, which converges to the exact optimal trajectories, possibly along with a number of switching instants, while exhibiting fixed-time convergence between consecutive switching instants. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose novel method for certifying if a given set of vertex linear systems constitute a linear difference inclusion for a nonlinear system. The method relies on formulating the verification of the inclusion as an optimization problem in a novel manner. The result is a Yes/No certificate. We illustrate how the method can be useful in obtaining less conservative linear enclosures for nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A Modal Analysis of Electromagnetic Fields Coupling into an Open-Ended Waveguide Mounted on a Finite Flange: Evaluation of a Rectangular Waveguide with a Square Flange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a modal analysis based on the reciprocity theorem to calculate the coupled/penetrated fields into an open-ended waveguide mounted on a finite flange. Although there is no limitation on the geometry and type of the external source, an infinitesimal dipole is chosen to produce a plane wave incident to the waveguide aperture. The proposed method relates the amplitude of each penetrated mode into the waveguide to the far-field radiation components of that mode from the waveguide aperture. The accuracy of the final result depends on the accuracy of the calculated radiated fields. The radiated field components are calculated considering the reflected fields due to the aperture and the diffracted fields due to the flange edges. For the first time, the impact of a finite flange on the penetrated fields into a waveguide is discussed comprehensively. The geometry of a rectangular waveguide mounted on a thick square flange is selected to be evaluated. The effects of changing the main parameters of the geometry on the penetrated fields are discussed rigorously in various examples. Our results are compared with 3D full-wave simulations, and an excellent agreement was found between the results while our analytical approach showing a 60 times faster performance. In addition, we compared our results with the measurement reported in a previous study.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised, Self-driving Multi-Step Growth of InAs/GaAs Quantum Dots Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks by closed-loop, autonomous experimentation which enables accelerated optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in automated process with minimal human intervention. In this work, we develop SemiEpi, a self-driving automation platform capable of executing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth with multi-steps, continuous in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard hardware, homemade software, curve fitting, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi operates autonomously, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes to achieve optimal outcomes. The platform actively learns from previous experimental results, identifying favorable conditions and proposing new experiments to achieve the desired results. We standardize and optimize growth for InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of ML-guided multi-step growth. A temperature calibration was implemented to get the initial growth condition, and fine control of the process was executed using ML. Leveraging RHEED movies acquired during the growth, SemiEpi successfully identified and optimized a novel route for multi-step heterostructure growth. This work demonstrates the capabilities of closed-loop, ML-guided systems in addressing challenges in multi-step growth for any device. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Our strategy facilitates the development of a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Geothermal Energy, Carbon Capture and Storage, and Hydrogen Storage hold considerable promise for meeting the energy sector's large-scale requirements and reducing CO$_2$ emissions. However, the injection of fluids into the Earth's crust, essential for these activities, can induce or trigger earthquakes. In this paper, we highlight a new approach based on Reinforcement Learning for the control of human-induced seismicity in the highly complex environment of an underground reservoir. This complex system poses significant challenges in the control design due to parameter uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. We show that the reinforcement learning algorithm can interact efficiently with a robust controller, by choosing the controller parameters in real-time, reducing human-induced seismicity and allowing the consideration of further production objectives, \textit{e.g.}, minimal control power. Simulations are presented for a simplified underground reservoir under various energy demand scenarios, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed control-reinforcement learning approach.</description>

      <title>RL-ADN: A High-Performance Deep Reinforcement Learning Environment for Optimal Energy Storage Systems Dispatch in Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents a promising avenue for optimizing Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) dispatch in distribution networks. This paper introduces RL-ADN, an innovative open-source library specifically designed for solving the optimal ESSs dispatch in active distribution networks. RL-ADN offers unparalleled flexibility in modeling distribution networks, and ESSs, accommodating a wide range of research goals. A standout feature of RL-ADN is its data augmentation module, based on Gaussian Mixture Model and Copula (GMC) functions, which elevates the performance ceiling of DRL agents. Additionally, RL-ADN incorporates the Laurent power flow solver, significantly reducing the computational burden of power flow calculations during training without sacrificing accuracy. The effectiveness of RL-ADN is demonstrated using in different sizes of distribution networks, showing marked performance improvements in the adaptability of DRL algorithms for ESS dispatch tasks. This enhancement is particularly beneficial from the increased diversity of training scenarios. Furthermore, RL-ADN achieves a tenfold increase in computational efficiency during training, making it highly suitable for large-scale network applications. The library sets a new benchmark in DRL-based ESSs dispatch in distribution networks and it is poised to advance DRL applications in distribution network operations significantly. RL-ADN is available at: https://github.com/ShengrenHou/RL-ADN.</description>

      <title>Online Model-based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series: Taxonomy, Survey, Research Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in engineering processes, like development, manufacturing and other operations involving dynamic systems. These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</description>

      <title>Multilinear Extensions in Submodular Optimization for Optimal Sensor Scheduling in Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal sensing nodes selection in dynamic systems is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been thoroughly studied in the recent literature. This problem can be formulated within the context of set optimization. For high-dimensional nonlinear systems, the problem is extremely difficult to solve. It scales poorly too. Current literature poses combinatorial submodular set optimization problems via maximizing observability performance metrics subject to matroid constraints. Such an approach is typically solved using greedy algorithms that require lower computational effort yet often yield sub-optimal solutions. In this letter, we address the sensing node selection problem for nonlinear dynamical networks using a variational form of the system dynamics, that basically perturb the system physics. As a result, we show that the observability performance metrics under such system representation are indeed submodular. The optimal problem is then solved using the multilinear continuous extension. This extension offers a computationally scalable and approximate continuous relaxation with a performance guarantee. The effectiveness of the extended submodular program is studied and compared to greedy algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed set optimization formulation for sensing node selection on nonlinear natural gas combustion networks.</description>

      <title>Entropy Rate Maximization of Markov Decision Processes under Linear Temporal Logic Tasks</title>

Abstract: We investigate the problem of synthesizing optimal control policies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with both qualitative and quantitative objectives. Specifically, our goal is to achieve a given linear temporal logic (LTL) task with probability one, while maximizing the \emph{entropy rate} of the system. The notion of entropy rate characterizes the long-run average (un)predictability of a stochastic process. Such an optimal policy is of our interest, in particular, from the security point of view, as it not only ensures the completion of tasks, but also maximizes the unpredictability of the system. However, existing works only focus on maximizing the total entropy which may diverge to infinity for infinite horizon. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL constraints. Specifically, we first present an algorithm for synthesizing entropy rate maximizing policies for communicating MDPs. Then based on a new state classification method, we show the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL task can be effectively solved in polynomial-time. We illustrate the proposed algorithm based on two case studies of robot task planning scenario.</description>

      <title>Even Order Explicit Symplectic Geometric Algorithms for Solving Quaternions in Guidance Navigation and Control via Diagonal Pad\'{e} Approximation and Cayley Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quaternion kinematical differential equation (QKDE) plays a key role in navigation, control and guidance systems. Although explicit symplectic geometric algorithms (ESGA) for this problem are available, there is a lack of a unified way for constructing high order symplectic difference schemes with configurable order parameter and the fractional interval sampling problem should be treated carefully. We present even order explicit symplectic geometric algorithms to solve the QKDE with diagonal Pad\'{e} approximation via a four-step strategy. Firstly, the Pad\'{e}-Cayley lemma is proved and used to simplify the symplectic Pad\'{e} approximation for the linear Hamiltonian system with infinitesimal symplectic structure. Secondly, both parallel and alternative iterative methods are proposed to construct the symplectic difference schemes with even order accuracy. Thirdly, the symplecity, orthogonality and invertibility of the single-step transition matrices are proved rigorously. Finally, the explicit symplectic geometric algorithms are designed for both the linear time-invariant and linear time-varying QKDE. The maximum absolute error for solving the QKDE is $\mathcal{O}((t_f-t_0)\tau^{2\ell})$ where $\tau$ is the time step, $\ell$ is the order parameter and $[t_0,t_f]$ is the time span. The linear time complexity and constant space complexity of computation as well as the simple algorithmic structure show that our algorithms are appropriate for real-time applications in aeronautics, astronautics, robotics and so on. The performance of the proposed algorithms are verified and validated by mathematical analysis and numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Point-Based Value Iteration for POMDPs with Neural Perception Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing trend to integrate neural networks and conventional software components in safety-critical settings calls for methodologies for their formal modelling, verification and correct-by-construction policy synthesis. We introduce neuro-symbolic partially observable Markov decision processes (NS-POMDPs), a variant of continuous-state POMDPs with discrete observations and actions, in which the agent perceives a continuous-state environment using a neural {\revise perception mechanism} and makes decisions symbolically. The perception mechanism classifies inputs such as images and sensor values into symbolic percepts, which are used in decision making.
  We study the problem of optimising discounted cumulative rewards for NS-POMDPs. Working directly with the continuous state space, we exploit the underlying structure of the model and the neural perception mechanism to propose a novel piecewise linear and convex representation (P-PWLC) in terms of polyhedra covering the state space and value vectors, and extend Bellman backups to this representation. We prove the convexity and continuity of value functions and present two value iteration algorithms that ensure finite representability. The first is a classical (exact) value iteration algorithm extending the $\alpha$-functions of Porta {\em et al} (2006) to the P-PWLC representation for continuous-state spaces. The second is a point-based (approximate) method called NS-HSVI, which uses the P-PWLC representation and belief-value induced functions to approximate value functions from below and above for two types of beliefs, particle-based and region-based. Using a prototype implementation, we show the practical applicability of our approach on two case studies that employ (trained) ReLU neural networks as perception functions, by synthesising (approximately) optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Barrier States Theory for Safety-Critical Multi-Objective Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective safety-critical control entails a diligent design to avoid possibly conflicting scenarios and ensure safety. This paper addresses multi-objective safety-critical control through a novel approach utilizing barrier states (BaS) to integrate safety into control design. It introduces the concept of safety embedded systems, where the safety condition is integrated with barrier functions to characterize a dynamical subsystem that is incorporated into the original model for control design. This approach reformulates the control problem to focus on designing a control law for an unconstrained system, ensuring that the barrier state remains bounded while achieving other performance objectives.
  The paper demonstrates that designing a stabilizing controller for the safety embedded system guarantees the safe stabilization of the original safety-critical system, effectively mitigating conflicts between performance and safety constraints. This approach enables the use of various legacy control methods from the literature to develop safe control laws. Moreover, it explores how this method can be applied to enforce input constraints and extend traditional control techniques to incorporate safety considerations. Additionally, the paper introduces input-to-state safety (ISSf) through barrier states for analyzing robust safety under bounded input disturbances and develops the notion of input-to-state safe stability (IS$^3$) for analyzing and designing robustly safe stabilizing feedback controls. The proposed techniques and concepts are used in various examples including the design of proportional-integral-derivative-barrier (PIDB) control for adaptive cruise control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of learning to charge Electric Vehicles (EVs) with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Traditional scheduling algorithms typically fail to balance near-optimal average performance with worst-case guarantees, particularly with OOD data. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is often too conservative and data-independent, whereas Reinforcement Learning (RL) tends to be overly aggressive and fully trusts the data, hindering their ability to consistently achieve the best-of-both-worlds. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel OOD-aware scheduling algorithm, denoted OOD-Charging. This algorithm employs a dynamic "awareness radius", which updates in real-time based on the Temporal Difference (TD)-error that reflects the severity of OOD. The OOD-Charging algorithm allows for a more effective balance between consistency and robustness in EV charging schedules, thereby significantly enhancing adaptability and efficiency in real-world charging environments. Our results demonstrate that this approach improves the scheduling reward reliably under real OOD scenarios with remarkable shifts of EV charging behaviors caused by COVID-19 in the Caltech ACN-Data.</description>

      <title>Semi-on-Demand Hybrid Transit Route Design with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the route design of a semi-on-demand hybrid route directional service in the public transit network, offering on-demand flexible route service in low-density areas and fixed route service in higher-density areas with Shared Autonomous Mobility Service (SAMS). The study develops analytically tractable cost expressions that capture access, waiting, and riding costs for users, and distance-based operating and time-based vehicle costs for operators. Two formulations are presented for strategic and tactical decisions in flexible route portion, fleet size, headway, and vehicle size optimization, enabling the determination of route types between fixed, hybrid, and flexible routes based on demand, cost, and operational parameters. The practical applications and benefits of semi-on-demand feeders are demonstrated with numerical examples and a large-scale case study in the Chicago metropolitan area. Findings reveal scenarios in which flexible route portions serving passengers located further away reduce total costs, particularly user costs. Lower operating costs in lower-demand areas favor more flexible routes, whereas higher demand densities favor more traditional line-based operations. On two studied lines, a current cost forecast favors smaller vehicles with flexible routes, but operating constraints and higher operating costs would favor bigger vehicles with hybrid routes. The study provides an analytical tool to design SAMS as directional services and transit feeders, and tractable continuous approximation formulations for future research in transit network design.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents novel solutions of the data-based synchronization problem for continuous-time multiagent systems. We consider the cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. First, we obtain a data-based representation of the synchronization error dynamics for homogeneous systems and show how to extend existing data-based stabilization results to stabilize such error dynamics. The proposed method relies on the solution of a set of linear matrix inequalities that are shown to be feasible. Then, we solve the synchronization problem for heterogeneous systems by means of dynamic controllers. Different from existing results, we do not require model knowledge for the followers and the leader. The theoretical results are finally validated using a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Mobile Edge Generation (MEG) by Constrained Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Aided Sequential Optimization for Unsignalized Intersection Management of Robot Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal unsignalized intersection management, wherein we seek to obtain safe and optimal trajectories, for a set of robots that arrive randomly and continually. This problem involves repeatedly solving a mixed integer program (with robot acceleration trajectories as decision variables) with different parameters, for which the computation time using a naive optimization algorithm scales exponentially with the number of robots and lanes. Hence, such an approach is not suitable for real-time implementation. In this paper, we propose a solution framework that combines learning and sequential optimization. In particular, we propose an algorithm for learning a shared policy that given the traffic state information, determines the crossing order of the robots. Then, we optimize the trajectories of the robots sequentially according to that crossing order. This approach inherently guarantees safety at all times. We validate the performance of this approach using extensive simulations and compare our approach against $5$ different heuristics from the literature in $9$ different simulation settings. Our approach, on average, significantly outperforms the heuristics from the literature in various metrics like objective function, weighted average of crossing times and computation time. For example, in some scenarios, we have observed that our approach offers up to $150\%$ improvement in objective value over the first come first serve heuristic. Even on untrained scenarios, our approach shows a consistent improvement (in objective value) of more than $30\%$ over all heuristics under consideration. We also show through simulations that the computation time for our approach scales linearly with the number of robots (assuming all other factors are constant). Learnt policies are implemented on physical robots with slightly modified framework to address real-world challenges.</description>

Abstract: In the early stages of product development, evaluating design concepts is crucial due to its impact on quality and cost. However, this process is often hindered by vague and uncertain design information. We use the Domain Specification Language (DSL) to improve design analysis and evaluation of systems incorporating simulation and physical parts. '
  Goal: Our method evaluates the integrity between the simulated and physical embodiment of the system. The assessment is done in various scopes, e.g. per pair of Digital Twins (DT) and its physical counterpart- Physical Twin (PT), system-wide, or one of many system setups.
  Method: We propose a DSL based on Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The Simulation-Physical Systems Modeling Language (SPSysML) defines the taxonomy of CPS consisting of at least a physical or simulated part. Based on SPSysML, we define quantitative factors and a requirement-based system structuring method, which enhances requirement analysis and allows DT to perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world.
  Result: SPSysML is used to develop a robotic system for the INCARE project. In subsequent iterations of the system's design process, the simulation-physical integrity of the system is improved, and more system components is shared between its simulated and physical embodiments. The designed system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators. System setups are based on Robot Operating System (ROS) and ROS2. Therefore, we argue that SPSysML is neither specific for a control system framework nor a robot simulator. SPSysML was used by a third-party developer and was assessed by him and other practitioners in a survey.
  Summary: SPSysML allows the design of systems featuring DTs and evaluation for improved integrity between simulation and physical parts. The requirement-based system structuring enhances the traceability of system requirements allocation.</description>

      <title>State Estimator Design: Addressing General Delay Structures with Dissipative Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative estimator (observer) design for continuous time-delay systems poses a significant challenge when an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays (DDs) are concerned. We propose an effective solution to this semi-open problem using the Krasovski\u{\i} functional (KF) framework in conjunction with a quadratic supply rate function, where both the plant and the estimator can accommodate an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays with an unlimited number of square-integrable kernels. A key contribution is the introduction of a control concept called Kronecker-Seuret Decomposition (KSD) for matrix-valued functions, which allows for the factorizations or approximations of any DD integral kernel without introducing conservatism. Moreover, using KSD facilitates the construction of complete-type KFs with integral kernels that can contain any number of weakly differentiable and linearly independent functions. Our proposed solution is formulated as sequential convex SDP problems and is set out in two theorems along with an off-line iterative algorithm, which eliminates the need for nonlinear numerical solvers. We show the effectiveness of our method using two challenging numerical experiments, including a system stabilized by a non-smooth controller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of energy-constrained planning for a cooperative system of an Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). In scenarios where the UGV serves as a mobile base to ferry the UAV and as a charging station to recharge the UAV, we formulate a novel energy-constrained routing problem. To tackle this problem, we design an energy-aware routing algorithm, aiming to minimize the overall mission duration under the energy limitations of both vehicles. The algorithm first solves a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to generate a guided tour. Then, it employs the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to refine the tour and generate paths for the two vehicles. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment. The results show that our algorithm consistently achieves near-optimal mission time and maintains fast running time across a wide range of problem instances.</description>

      <title>Dynamical State Feedback Control for Linear Input Delay Systems, Part I: Dissipative Stabilization via Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an SDP-based framework to address the stabilization of input delay systems while taking into account dissipative constraints. A key to our approach is the introduction of the concept of parameterized linear dynamical state feedbacks (LDSFs), which draws inspiration from recent advancements in the analyses of distributed delays. Importantly, the parameterized LDSFs generalize conventional predictor controllers, where the interpretation of state prediction is concealed and their degree of parameterization can be increased by adjusting the integral kernels. A sufficient condition for the existence of dissipative LDSFs is formulated as matrix inequalities by constructing a complete type Krasovski\u{\i} functional. To solve the bilinear matrix inequality in the synthesis condition, we employ an off-line inner convex approximation algorithm that can be initialized using the gains of predictor controllers obtained via explicit construction. Finally, the unknowns of our dissipative LTDS can be directly obtained by solving convex semidefinite programs. Numerical examples and simulations were experimented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology.</description>

Abstract: Collision-free motion is essential for mobile robots. Most approaches to collision-free and efficient navigation with wheeled robots require parameter tuning by experts to obtain good navigation behavior. This study investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning to train a mobile robot for autonomous navigation in a complex environment. The robot utilizes LiDAR sensor data and a deep neural network to generate control signals guiding it toward a specified target while avoiding obstacles. We employ two reinforcement learning algorithms in the Gazebo simulation environment: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and proximal policy optimization. The study introduces an enhanced neural network structure in the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to boost performance, accompanied by a well-designed reward function to improve algorithm efficacy. Experimental results conducted in both obstacle and obstacle-free environments underscore the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This research significantly contributes to the advancement of autonomous robotics in complex environments through the application of deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Mobile Edge Generation-Enabled Digital Twin: Architecture Design and Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02804</link>

Abstract: A novel paradigm of mobile edge generation (MEG)-enabled digital twin (DT) is proposed, which enables distributed on-device generation at mobile edge networks for real-time DT applications. First, an MEG-DT architecture is put forward to decentralize generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models onto edge servers (ESs) and user equipments (UEs), which has the advantages of low latency, privacy preservation, and individual-level customization. Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and research opportunities are identified.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131</link>

Abstract: Humans often learn new skills by imitating the experts and gradually developing their proficiency. In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</description>
