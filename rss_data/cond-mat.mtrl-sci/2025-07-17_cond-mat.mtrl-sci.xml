      <title>Kinetics of Vacancy-Assisted Reversible Phase Transition in Monolayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetics of phase transition between the 2H and 1T$^\prime$ phases in monolayer MoTe$_2$ using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential trained on SCAN-DFT data, combined with mean field kinetic theory to interpret the underlying mechanisms. The transition is found to involve both diffusive and diffusionless mechanisms. Nucleation of 1T$^\prime$ phase is initiated by the coalescence of neighboring Te monovacancies into divacancies, which are found to be mobile and can interact with other Te vacancies to form small triangular 1T$^\prime$ islands. Growth of these islands proceeds either by incorporating pre-existing vacancies at the phase boundaries or, in their absence, by absorbing divacancies that migrate from the surrounding lattice. Once a critical island size is reached, vacancy-free growth becomes possible although with a higher activation barrier. Upon removal of external stimuli, the system reverts to 2H phase, during which Te vacancies reorganize into three-fold spoke-like vacancy lines at the island center. This reverse process and the subsequent 1T$^\prime$$\leftrightarrow$2H reversible transitions are diffusionless, rapid, do not require additional vacancies and can be driven by mild external stimuli. Although our analysis focuses on strain-induced transitions, the kinetic mechanisms are expected to be generalizable to other types of stimuli.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Thermal Conductivity via Singlet-Dominated Scattering in TmFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the thermal conductivity of the rare-earth orthoferrites, $R$FeO$_3$, where $R$ = Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb and see an anomalous strong suppression for TmFeO$_3$. Using a Debye thermal transport model, we demonstrate that this suppression is due to resonant scattering between phonons and the Tm$^{3+}$ $4f$ singlet crystal field levels. The implications of these results are discussed in context of thermal conductivity studies in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Low-energy domain wall racetracks with multiferroic topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional racetrack memories move information by pushing magnetic domain walls or other spin textures with spin-polarized currents, but the accompanying Joule heating inflates their energy budget and can hamper scaling. Here we present a voltage-controlled, magnetoelectric racetrack in which transverse electric fields translate coupled ferroelectric-antiferromagnetic walls along BiFeO3 nanostrips at room temperature. Because no charge traverses the track, the switching dissipates orders of magnitude less energy than the most efficient spin-torque devices with more favourable scaling, making the scheme significantly more attractive at the nanoscale. We further uncover noncollinear topological magnetoelectric textures that emerge at domain walls in BiFeO3, where the nature of these topologies influences their stability upon translation. Among these are polar bi-merons and polar vertices magnetoelectrically coupled with magnetic cycloid disclinations and previously unobserved, topological magnetic cycloid twist topologies. We observe domain wall velocities of at least kilometres per second - matching or surpassing the fastest ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic racetracks and approaching the acoustic-phonon limit of BiFeO3 - while preserving these topologies over tens of micrometres. The resulting high velocity, low-energy racetrack delivers nanosecond access times without the thermal overhead of current-driven schemes, charting a path toward dense, ultralow-power racetrack devices which rely on spin texture translation.</description>

      <title>Extreme Thermal Insulation in Nano-Bubble Wrap Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving ultra-low thermal conductivity under ambient conditions is a fundamental challenge constrained by classical heat transport limits and material design trade-offs. Here, we introduce a new class of nano-bubble wrap architectures that achieve exceptionally low thermal conductivity by integrating nanoscale gas confinement with atomically thin, weakly coupled van der Waals solids. Using scalable patterning of 2D monolayers into periodic nano-bubbles and nano-wrinkles, we construct materials with structural analogies to macroscopic bubble wrap but engineered at length scales much shorter than the mean free path of air and the mean free path of phonons in the atomically thin monolayers. Time-domain thermoreflectance measurements reveal out-of-plane thermal conductivities nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of air and commercial aerogels, reaching critical values below 0.001 W $\cdot$ M$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This extreme thermal resistance arises from the combined suppression of gas-phase conduction, phonon transport, and interfacial coupling. Our findings establish nano-bubble wraps as a versatile platform for tuning heat flow in ultrathin materials and open new pathways for designing thermal metamaterials and energy-efficient technologies.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic magnetization dynamics in tensile-strained ultrathin yttrium iron garnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-reorientation Driven Temperature Dependent Intrinsic Anomalous Hall Conductivity in Fe$_3$Ge, a Ferromagnetic Topological Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in Fe$_3$Ge, which is a ferromagnetic topological metal. We observe a significant anisotropy in the anomalous Hall conductivity between in-plane and out-of-plane directions. We further identify that the total Hall conductivity is contributed extrinsically due to the skew-scattering mechanism and intrinsically due to nonzero Berry curvature in the momentum space. Most importantly, we demonstrate the temperature dependence of the intrinsic Hall contribution, a rare phenomenon to visualize experimentally, due to tuning the easy-magnetic axis from the out-of-plane to the in-plane with decreasing temperature. We also show that the extrinsic Hall conductivity decreases with temperature as $\sigma_{xy}^{ext}(T)=\frac{\sigma_{xy0}^{ext}}{(aT+1)^2}$ due to electron-phonon scattering.</description>

      <title>Structure determination of flat honeycomb Bi grown on Ag(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeycomb bismuthene structures on Ag(111) were investigated using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and density functional theory. LEED I(V) analysis revealed that 0.5 monolayer (ML) of Bi forms an ultraflat honeycomb lattice with negligible buckling at ~120 K, which transforms into other structures upon warming to room temperature. A similar flat bismuthene structure also forms in Mn/Bi/Ag(111), which remains stable even at room temperature. Mn deposition on $(p\times \sqrt{3})$-rect Bi/Ag(111) induces Bi surface segregation, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, resulting in a p$(2\times2)$ honeycomb bismuthene. The detailed structural investigation provides fundamental insights into the characterization of two-dimensional topological properties of bismuthene grown on Ag(111).</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Approach for Modeling of Ternary Based Strained-Layer Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary-based InAs/InAs1-xSbx Strained-Layer Superlattice (SLS)material with type-II band alignment belongs to the 6.1 A family with reasonably small lattice mismatch with GaSb substrate for epitaxial growth. InAs/InAs1-xSbx SLS have been proven to have more advantages such as longer carrier lifetime, better control on growth and manufacturability, and being considered as an alternative material system for infrared photodetectors. In this article a quantum mechanical based modelling on electronic band structure of InAs/InAs1-xSbx is presented. A modified sp3s* empirical tight binding method along with implementing a virtual crystal approximation with a bowing of the s-on-site tight-binding energy, were incorporated. In this approach, a theoretical explanation of atomic segregation in superlattices is suggested and used in calculations. The simulations show good agreement with experimentally measured band gap of InAs/InAs1-xSbx superlattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometrical bound relations for observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bound relations among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bound relations for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, by generalizing the parameter space, we demonstrate that bound relations hold for all linear responses. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, by extending the projection operator, we establish a bound relation between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bound relations necessarily reflects quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Chemical vapor deposition synthesis of (GeTe)n(Sb2Te3) gradient crystalline films as promising planar heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-change materials of the (GeTe)n (Sb2Te3) (GST) system are of high relevance in memory storage and energy conversion applications due to their fast-switching speed, high data retention, and tunable properties. Here, we report on a fast and efficient CVD-based method for the fabrication of crystalline GST films with variable Ge/Sb atomic content. In particular, the approach enables compositional control without changing the precursor, facilitating a gradient synthesis of Ge3Sb2Te6, Ge2Sb2Te5, and GeSb2Te4 phases in a single attempt. The analyses of their structural, optical, and electrical aspects highlight how compositional variation influences the film's properties. Our findings demonstrate a straightforward approach enabling the preparation of gradient crystalline GST films with tunable morphology and functionality. These gradient films can potentially provide in-plane multilevel and gradual switching thresholds for memory applications and altered refractive index and absorption for optical modulation and filtering applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Triple-q State in Antiferromagnetic Monolayer Interfaced with Bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer on Ag(111) by evaporating Mn atoms onto (pxroot3)-Bi/Ag(111) at room temperature. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), we have resolved the magnetic triple-q (3Q) state. In combination with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the 3Q3-like spin texture is the magnetic ground state for the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer/Ag(111). Interestingly, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of 3Q3 state triggered by the bismuthene on top of Mn monolayer/Ag(111) has been revealed, which is consistent with the switching of 3Q3up and 3Q3down domains observed by SP-STM measurements with external magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate room-temperature nucleation and manipulation of topological spin textures in the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2, through laser pulse excitation. By leveraging laser-induced heating and subsequent cooling, we access the skyrmion/bubble state at low fields and achieve toggle switching between two topological spin textures - skyrmion/bubble and labyrinth. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this switching behaviour arises from laser-induced heating and cooling. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW ferromagnets for room temperature laser-controlled non-volatile memory storage applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping diverse hysteresis dynamics in scaled MoS$_2$ FETs using the universal method derived from TCAD modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials have already reached the stage of trial FAB integration. However, reliability limitations caused by various defects present a serious obstacle for their smooth way forward, especially when scaling the device geometries. Still the ongoing research is mostly focused on pure technology aspects, while reliability is often recalled only when showing a randomly measured gate transfer curve to manifest that the hysteresis is "negligible".In fact the hysteresis dynamics contain unique fingerprints of various mechanisms which may coexist or cancel each other, being more complex in scaled FETs, for instance because of simultaneous interaction of defects with the channel and top gate in thin insulators. To fill this gap, here by doing TCAD modeling for nanoscale MoS$_2$/HfO$_2$ FETs we introduce the universal hysteresis mapping method which can correctly capture commonly measured diverse hysteresis dynamics such as conventional clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) hysteresis, as well as CW/CCW switching and time separation. Next we extend this method to bias-temperature instabilities (BTI) and show a clear correlation between complex hysteresis dynamics and abnormal BTI recovery. Finally, we validate our mapping method using available experimental data for MoS$_2$ FETs and demonstrate that it provides far more accurate results than a conventional constant current extraction of the hysteresis width, being also usable if a CCW hysteresis is caused by mobile ions.</description>

      <title>History-dependent and frequency-dependent dielectric nonlinearities induced by polar nanoregions in a thin film of 0.5 ( Ba 0.7 Ca 0.3 TiO 3 ) -- 0.5 ( BaZr 0.2 Ti 0.8 O 3 )</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, dielectric nonlinearities in 0.5(Ba0.7 Ca0.3 TiO3 ) -- 0.5(BaZr 0.2 Ti0.8 O3 ) thin film are studied using impedance spectroscopy and harmonic measurements, as a function of the AC measuring field, at different frequencies and upon cycling. The measurements reveal that the pinching of the hysteresis loop, characterized by a phase angle of the third harmonic close to --270 deg, is stronger for low frequencies. This confirms that the pinching is induced by the presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs), whose responses are also strongly dependent on frequency. When repeating the measurement, the PNR contribution changes since the phase angle of the third-harmonic response evolves from pinched to conventional relaxor. This shows that strong changes in the PNR configuration can be induced, even for low AC fields. First-order reversal curves (FORCs) confirm the presence of a pinched hysteresis loop. When repeating the FORC measurement a second time, the distribution drastically changes and corresponds to a soft ferroelectric. The asymmetry of the Preisach plane measured using FORCs is confirmed by a proposed measurement strategy: unipolar impedance measurements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nearly two decades, it has been known that electron irradiation of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in a transmission electron microscope leads to the formation of triangular pores. This has been attributed to the lower displacement threshold energy of boron, with or without the assistance of an inelastic scattering event, typically assuming that chemical etching caused by residual gases can be neglected. In this study, in contrast to previous high-vacuum experiments, we show that electron irradiation in ultra-high vacuum leads to circular pores, whereas even small amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere during the experiment change the pores into triangles. Ab initio calculations show that oxygen atoms preferentially attach to boron at the pore edge, supporting the hypothesis that they are preferentially etched during irradiation, resulting in nitrogen-terminated triangular defects. Our results explain the origin of triangular pores in hBN and demonstrate a deterministic way to create atomically-defined pores into 2D materials.</description>

      <title>From the up-converting multimodal luminescent thermometer to ratiometric visual power density meter based on Er3+,Yb3+ emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that thermally induced variations in the spectroscopic properties of Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ can be effectively harnessed for multimodal remote temperature sensing. As shown, Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ supports multiple ratiometric sensing modes based on the intensity ratios of (i) 2H11/2 -&gt; 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 -&gt; 4I15/2; (ii) 2H9/2 -&gt; 4I13/2 and 4S3/2 -&gt; 4I15/2; and (iii) green-to-red emission intensity ratio, achieving maximum relative sensitivities of 2.8% K-1, 3% K-1, and 1.8% K-1, respectively. The synergy between thermal changes observed in the green-to-red emission intensity ratio of Er3+ ions, combined with the efficient optical heating of Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ at elevated Yb3+ concentrations enables the development of a visual optical power density sensor, exhibiting relative sensitivities of SRx = 1.0% W-1 cm2 and SRy = 0.9% W-1 cm2 at 15 W cm-2 when quantified using CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a visual luminescent optical power density sensor. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ can be successfully applied for two-dimensional imaging of optical power density, thereby enabling spatial visualization of power distribution within an illuminated field.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of eutectic high entropy alloy AlCoCrFeNi2.1 under shock compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of metals that exhibit unique mechanical performance. Among HEAs, additively manufactured eutectic high entropy alloys (AM-EHEAs) have recently emerged as candidate materials for use in extreme conditions due to their simultaneous high strength and ductility. However, the deformation and structural evolution of AM-EHEAs under conditions of high pressure have not been well characterized, limiting their use in extreme applications. We present dynamic compression experiments and molecular dynamics simulations studying the structural evolution of AM-EHEA AlCoCrFeNi2.1 when compressed to pressures up to 400 GPa. Our in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements capture the appearance of fcc and bcc phases at different pressure conditions, with pure- and mixed-phase regions. Understanding the phase stability and structural evolution of the AM EHEA offers new insights to guide the development of high-performance complex materials for extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Preferential site ordering alters the magnetic structure of Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ ($x = 0$-2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important aspect of materials research is the ability to tune different physical properties through controlled alloying. The Ln$_3$M$_4$X$_{13}$ (Ln = Lanthanide, M = Transition Metal, X = Tetrel) filled skutterudite family is of interest due to the tunability of its constituent components and their effects on physical properties, such as superconductivity and complex magnetism. In this work, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ (x = 0 -- 2) was synthesized via excess Sn-flux and characterized using powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and heat capacity. Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and its Ge-solid-solution members crystallize in the Pm-3n space group, which has two unique Wyckoff positions for the tetrel (X) site. In the solid solution members, Ge shows preferential occupancy for one of the two Wyckoff sites, reaching $\sim$60$\%$ and 100$\%$ occupancy when x = 1 and 2, respectively. Magnetometry and heat capacity measurements of Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ indicated antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$ = 7.3 K. However, Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{12}$Ge and Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{11}$Ge$_2$ showed notably lower-temperature antiferromagnetic phase transitions with substantial peak-broadening at $T_N$ = 5.5 K and 4.1 K, respectively. These data suggest that alloying Ge into Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ causes magnetic frustration within the structure, likely attributable to a change in the density of states from additional Ge $p$ states at the Fermi level. This work demonstrates that preferentially alloying Ge in Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13-x}$Ge$_x$ allows for more precise tunability of its magnetic structure, elucidating design principles for different quantum phases in intermetallic materials.</description>

      <title>The carbon cost of materials discovery: Can machine learning really accelerate the discovery of new photovoltaics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery pipelines.</description>

      <title>Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH9</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Multi-Q Order in CoxTaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cobalt-intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Co$_x$TaS$_2$ hosts a rich landscape of magnetic phases that depend sensitively on $x$. While the stoichiometric compound with $x=1/3$ exhibits a single magnetic transition, samples with $x\leq 0.325$ display two transitions with an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerging in the lower temperature phase. Here, we resolve the spin structure in each phase by employing a suite of magneto-optical probes that include the discovery of anomalous magneto-birefringence -- a spontaneous time-reversal sensitive rotation of the principal optic axes. A symmetry-based analysis identifies the AHE-active phase as an anisotropic (2+1)\textbf{Q} state, in which magnetic modulation at one wavevector (\textbf{Q}) differs in symmetry from that at the remaining two. The (2+1)\textbf{Q} state naturally exhibits scalar spin chirality as a mechanism for the AHE and expands the classification of multi-Q magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Collinear Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions Implemented in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by N\'eel vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Strain-Engineered Thermoelectric Performance of 2D-Xene Nanoribbons</title>

Abstract: The quest for efficient and scalable thermoelectric materials has catalyzed intense interest in quasi 1D nanoribbons, where reduced dimensionality and structural tunability can decouple key transport parameters to enhance energy conversion. In this work, we present a unified comparative study of the thermopower in armchair nanoribbons derived from five archetypal 2D materials: graphene, silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene. Using a tight binding model parametrized by first principles inputs and solved within the Landauer Buttiker formalism, we compute strain and width dependent thermopower across nanoribbons classified by width families (3p, 3p+1, 3p+2) over a wide range of uniaxial tensile strain. Our results reveal that thermoelectric behavior is governed by a complex interplay of bandgap evolution, chemical potential asymmetry, and quantum confinement. While graphene and silicene exhibit pronounced family and width sensitive thermopower enhancement under moderate strain, heavier Xenes such as germanene and stanene show diminished responses. In particular, phosphorene nanoribbons emerge as exceptional, exhibiting remarkably high thermopower (62 kB/e), a consequence of their large, persistent bandgap and anisotropic electronic structure. Across all systems, the 3p+2 family transitions from near-metallic to semiconducting under strain, enabling dramatic activation of thermopower in previously inactive configurations. This systematic cross material analysis delineates the design principles for the optimization of TE in 1D nanoribbons, highlighting the strategic use of width control and strain engineering. Our findings identify phosphorene as an intrinsically superior thermoelectric material and position strained Xene nanoribbons as promising candidates for tunable, low-dimensional thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented flow strength in shock-compressed nano-polycrystalline diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond is the hardest natural material and thus offers unique insights into materials design. Extreme pressures and temperatures create conditions that allow even strong and brittle materials like diamond to deform plastically and exhibit flow strength, i.e., resistance to plastic flow. Despite significant research, the upper limit of flow strength in diamond materials under high energy conditions remains uncertain, and the mechanisms driving the deformation are a subject of intense debate. Here, we demonstrate that stacking-fault mediated strengthening enables nano-polycrystalline diamond (NPD) to achieve a peak flow strength of 107+-5 GPa. Achieved through shock loading to multi-megabar stresses, this unprecedented flow strength represents a five-fold increase compared to that of quasi-statically compressed NPD. Our femtosecond in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations probe this phenomenon mechanistically. Our work shows that by subjecting materials to the most extreme conditions, we can unlock unusual strength and mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Defect design in ferroelectrics -- new insights on agglomeration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we furthermore show that a pinched double-loop field hysteresis allows for large recoverable stored energy which can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase.</description>

Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly promising candidates for a myriad of potential applications in room-temperature electronics; however, as it stands, establishing a clear connection between their spin-state switching and transport properties has been far from trivial. In this Perspective, an effort to unravel the underlying charge transport mechanism in these SCO complexes, via a general theory, is made. The theory presented herein is aimed at providing a unifying picture that explains the widely different trends observed in the spin-crossover-dependent carrier transport properties in the SCO molecular thin film systems.</description>

      <title>Composition effect in the thermo-mechanical behavior of glasses, and its modelization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employed molecular dynamics simulations to explore comparatively the thermo-mechanical behavior of two glass materials-an oxide silica glass (SiO2) and a binary Cu-Zr-based metallic alloy (Cu50Zr50)-during shear and elongation deformation cycles. By calculating the energy balance and tracking the temperature evolution of both glasses under deformation cycles, we are able to propose, for each of them, a constitutive law which accurately reproduces the self-heating process due to plastic deformation. These relatively simple constitutive laws involve strain rate sensitivity and a non-linear temperature dependence of the thermal dilatancy coefficients, as well as strain gradient plasticity. To identify the right parameters, both glasses are equilibrated at very low temperature (10 K) and two independent deformation rates were applied to each sample for each type of deformation. Thermal attenuation is greatly amplified in silica compared to the metallic glass. Moreover, using precise atomic description of the instantaneous deformation, combined with exact coarse-graining procedure, we show, in silica, that self-heating is mainly supported by inhomogeneous strain gradient plasticity with nanometric characteristic lengthscales.</description>

Abstract: Dislocation-density-based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructural changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate-driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. We point out the existence of saturation dislocation densities and the role played by the initial dislocation density which significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. Since the initial micro-structure, modeled through the dislocation density, could be related to the size or the sample preparation process, implicit size-dependent effects can also be conjectured.
  To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Training Enhances Machine Learning Potentials for Long-Lasting Molecular Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are vital for exploring complex systems in computational physics and chemistry. While machine learning methods dramatically reduce computational costs relative to ab initio methods, their accuracy in long-lasting simulations remains limited. Here we propose dynamic training (DT), a method designed to enhance accuracy of a model over extended MD simulations. Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.</description>

      <title>A collapsed interface approach to resolve grain boundaries in finite element simulations of polycrystalline diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic diffusion affects the properties of various engineering materials, which predominantly occur in the polycrystalline state. A rigorous description of polycrystalline diffusion must therefore account for crystallographic defects, especially grain boundaries (GBs), whose structure and volume fraction - and hence the effective grain size - govern mass transport. Experiments and atomistic simulations consistently show that GBs can accelerate diffusion by up to several orders of magnitude and that fluxes along and across the interface are generally anisotropic. Conventional mesoscale models either neglect GBs or invoke idealized analytical corrections. Fully resolved finite-element meshes are accurate but computationally infeasible when nanometer-thin GB layers are involved. We introduce a collapsed-interface finite element that integrates the GB thickness analytically and embeds the result in a two-dimensional surface element. The formulation (i) treats in-plane and through-plane diffusivity independently, (ii) couples to the surrounding grain matrix without the need for mesh manipulations, and (iii) parametrizes both grain size and GB volume fraction via simple affine scalings, allowing systematic variation without remeshing. Effective diffusivity tensors are extracted by linear computational homogenization. The new finite element reproduces three-dimensional GB transport phenomena - channeled fluxes, concentration discontinuities - at a fraction of the computational cost of explicit models. Parametric studies spanning multiple orders of magnitude in GB diffusivity reveal four distinct diffusion regimes and quantify their impact on the overall response. The framework thus connects atomistic data and continuum predictions, providing an efficient tool for diffusion-driven design and optimization of polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Ab initio X-ray Near-Edge Spectroscopy of Sodium-Based Multi-Alkali Antimonides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-alkali antimonides (MAAs) are promising materials for vacuum electron sources. While sodium-based MAAs have demonstrated superior characteristics for ultrabright electron sources, their synthesis remains challenging, often resulting in mixed stoichiometries and polycrystalline domains. To address this complexity and guide the characterization of experimentally grown photocathodes, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of the X-ray near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of four ternary MAAs: cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, representing the experimentally known phase of each stoichiometry, as well as hexagonal Na$_2$KSb and cubic NaK$_2$Sb, two computationally predicted polymorphs. Employing state-of-the-art ab initio methods based on all-electron density-functional theory and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we compute and analyze the XANES at the sodium and potassium K-edges, potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, and antimony K and L$_2$-edges. Our analysis reveals distinct spectral fingerprints for the experimentally known phases, cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, particularly at the sodium K-edge and potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, providing useful indications for their identification in complex samples. We further investigate the role of excitonic effects by comparing BSE spectra and their counterparts obtained in the independent-particle approximation, highlighting their significant influence on the near-edge features, especially for shallower core levels. Our findings offer a useful theoretical benchmark for the experimental characterization and diagnostics of sodium-based MAA photocathodes, complementing experiments on resolved phases and providing the spectral fingerprints of computationally predicted phases that could emerge in polycrystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonances between excitonic transitions and nuclear coordinates have been shown to drive a variety of excited-state dynamical phenomena in molecular systems. Here, we report mixed quantum--classical simulations showing similar resonances to primarily contribute to valley depolarization in monolayer MoS$_2$. The applied simulation framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure, electron--hole interactions, and carrier--phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations. This enables low-cost excited-state dynamics simulations that are microscopic, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative in the carrier--phonon interaction. The framework furthermore retains explicit information on transient phonon occupancies, through which we show a resonance between the dominant optical phonon branch and the lowest exciton band to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle--Silva--Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy effect on stabilizing magnetization plateaus of kagome strip chain Heisenberg antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic effect of magnetization plateaus in the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome strip chain. The kagome strip chain Heisenberg model, composed of a hexagonal net of triangles forming five-site unit cells, exhibits four magnetization plateaus in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Using numerical density matrix renormalization group method, we find that the magnetization plateaus are stable against anisotropic interactions in the same direction of the applied magnetic field, but the plateaus become much smaller with anisotropic interactions in other directions. We further show the anisotropic effect of the magnon excitations of the 0.6 plateau state using linear spin wave theory. The magnon bandwidth remains small when tuning the anisotropic interactions along the field where the magnetization plateau is stable, while the band becomes more dispersive with anisotropic interactions perpendicular to the field. In addition, upon tuning down the interaction strength for the two lower legs below a critical value, the Hamiltonian of the kagome strip chain is dominated by two separate spin chains. This can be used to determine the effective lattice structure in materials with strong distortions. Our results enhance the theoretical understanding of the anisotropic effect and the nature of magnetization plateaus in kagome strip chain materials, which can contribute to the design and manipulation of kagome materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>

Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N\'eel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</description>
