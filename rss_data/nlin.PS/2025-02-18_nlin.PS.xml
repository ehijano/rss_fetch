      <title>Signature of glassy dynamics in dynamic modes decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, e.g., in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study analytically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their characterization. Here, we show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation. The dynamic mode decomposition, which is a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum, thus provides a model-agnostic signature for detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of one-dimensional ODEs and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>Active Solids: Defect Self-Propulsion Without Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-propulsion of +1/2 topological defects is a hallmark of active nematic fluids, where the defects are advected by the flow field they themselves generate. In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration.</description>

      <title>NLS approximation and dark solitons for the Adlam-Allen model of cold collisionless plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work extends earlier considerations on a quintessential model of cold, collisionless plasmas, namely the Adlam-Allen model. Previously, an analysis of homoclinic solutions around a non-vanishing background (associated with a saddle equilibrium) led to a Korteweg-de Vries reduction. Here, we consider a different equilibrium of the co-traveling frame model, namely a center, and expanding around it, by means of a multiple-scale methodology and suitable scalings, leads to an effective defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Leveraging the latter, we construct, for the first time to our knowledge, physically realistic dark soliton waveforms of the Adlam-Allen model. We subsequently test the numerical evolution of such coherent structures, identifying them as long-lived waveforms of the full model.</description>

      <title>Traveling spatially localized convective structures in an inclined porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple stationary, localized structures were recently found for inclined porous medium convection with constant-temperature boundaries. We analyze traveling asymmetric, localized convective structures, consisting of 1 to 5 pulses, in a 2D inclined porous layer with fixed temperature at the bottom and an imperfectly conducting boundary at the top, such that midplane reflection symmetry is broken. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed with different Biot numbers at the top boundary. The drift velocity $c$ of pulses is measured for different values of the symmetry parameter $\kappa\geq0$ based on the Biot number, with perfect midplane reflection symmetry and $c=0$ at $\kappa=0$. In small domains, the drift velocity $c&gt;0$ (upslope), increases monotonically with $\kappa$, while in large domains $c$ changes sign depending on parameters. We show that pulse tails, controlling interactions, depend on the dominant spatial eigenvalues, whose real part is closest to zero, with a transition at $\kappa_c&gt;0$: below $\kappa_c$, both dominant eigenvalues are complex, and the tails are oscillatory. Above $\kappa_c$, the dominant spatial eigenvalue with a positive real part becomes real, and the downslope tail transitions from oscillatory to monotonic. Below $\kappa_c$, bound states with different numbers of pulses exist whose collisions are studied. Well above $\kappa_c$, adjacent pulses repel each other, spreading out and becoming equispaced in the domain. A reduced model is proposed based on the interaction via tails of adjacent pulses, reproducing the repulsion and collisions from DNS. The model shows that the transition from bound states to equidistant spreading occurs when the monotonic/oscillatory tails have the same slope. This study elucidates the motion of localized patterns in moderate-Rayleigh number convection in an inclined porous layer with an imperfectly conducting boundary.</description>
