      <title>Bergman kernels over polarized K\"ahler manifolds, Bergman logarithmic flatness, and a question of Lu-Tian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete K\"ahler manifold, and let $(L, h) \to M$ be a positive line bundle inducing a K\"ahler metric $g$ on $M$. We study two Bergman kernels in this setting: the Bergman kernel of the disk bundle of the dual line bundle $(L^*, h^*)$, and the Bergman kernel of the line bundle $(L^k, h^k)$, $k\geq 1$, twisted by the canonical line bundle of $(M, g)$. We first prove a localization result for the former Bergman kernel. Then we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for this Bergman kernel to have no logarithmic singularity, expressed in terms of the Tian-Yau-Zelditch-Catlin type expansion of the latter Bergman kernel. This result, in particular, answers a question posed by Lu and Tian. As an application, we show that if $(M, g)$ is compact and locally homogeneous, then the circle bundle of $(L^*, h^*)$ is necessarily Bergman logarithmically flat.</description>

      <title>The existence of valuative interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, using key tools including Zhou valuations, Tian functions and a convergence result for relative types, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the rings of germs of holomorphic functions and real analytic functions at the origin in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, respectively. For the cases of polynomial rings with complex and real coefficients, we establish separate necessary conditions and sufficient conditions, which become both necessary and sufficient when the intersection of the zero sets of the given polynomials is the set of the origin in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$.
  Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a valuation to be of the form given by a relative type with respect to a tame maximal weight. We demonstrate a result of Boucksom--Favre--Jonsson on quasimonomial valuations also holds for quasimonomial Zhou valuations. Finally, we obtain a relationship between Zhou valuations and the differentiable points of Tian functions.</description>

      <title>Sharp restrictions of analytic function spaces of several variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository paper we collect many recent advances in analytic function spaces of several complex variables related with trace problem in tubular domains over symmetric cones and bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains with smooth boundary. We consider various function space of analytic functions of several variables in various domains in $C^n$ and provide or complete descriptions of traces or estimates of traces of various analytic function spaces in various domains obtained in recent years, by various authors. The problem to find sharp estimates of traces of Hardy analytic function spaces in the unit polydisk first was posed by W. Rudin in 1969. Since then many papers appeared in literature. We collect in this expository paper not only already many known results on traces of various analytic function spaces in product domains but also discuss various new interesting results related with this problem. Related to trace problem various results were provided previously by G. Henkin, E. Amar, H. Alexander and various other authors. Finnaly, note that our trace theorems are closely related with the Bergman type projections acting between function spaces with different dimensions. This expository paper contains mainly new results concerning traces in tubular and bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains, proofs of these theorems are based in particular also on various properties of Bergman type projection, in this expository paper we will also shortly discuss some new results obtained by first author on Bergman type projections in these complicated domains in $C^n$. This is the second part of our notes related with trace problem. In the first part we provided a large list of recent sharp results on traces in the polydisk and polyball and was published in [1].</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of first derivatives and differences in meromorphic functions and the characterization of entire function periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the paper is twofold. The first objective is to study the uniqueness problem of meromorphic function $f(z)$ when $f^{(1)}(z)$ shares two distinct finite values $a_1$, $a_2$ and $\infty$ CM with $\Delta_cf(z)$. In this context, we provide a result that resolves the open problem posed by Qi et al. [Comput. Methods Funct. Theory, 18 (2018), 567-582] for the case when hyper order of the function is less than $\infty$. The second objective is to establish sufficient conditions for the periodicity of transcendental entire functions. In this direction, we obtain a result that affirms the question raised by Wei et al. [Anal. Math., 47 (2021), 695-708.]</description>

      <title>A Unified Study of Bohr's Inequality for analytic and harmonic mappings on the Unit Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate improved forms of the Bohr inequality, using the quantity $S_r/\pi$, for analytic selfmaps in class $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathbb{D}$, where $S_r$ is the area measure of $\mathbb{D}_r$. We then generalize the inequality for harmonic mappings ($\mathcal{P}^0_{\mathcal{H}}(M)$ and $\mathcal{W}^0_{\mathcal{H}}(\alpha)$ of the form $f = h + \overline{g}$) by introducing a sequence $\{\varphi_n(r)\}_{n=0}^\infty$ of differentiable, increasing functions on $[0, 1)$. The Hurwitz Lerch Zeta function is utilized for some consequences, and all results are shown to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Convolution features of univalent meromorphic functions generated by Barnes-Mittag-Leffler function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mittag-Leffler function plays an important role in Geometric Function Theory, particularly in the study of analytic and meromorphic function classes. Among its various generalizations, the Barnes-Mittag-Leffler function stands out due to its intricate structure and applications in diverse mathematical fields. In this paper, our main focus is to investigate the convolution properties of these functions and establish conditions that ensure specific geometric characteristics. Additionally, we explore membership relations for functions in these classes. The results obtained in this work are novel, and their significance is demonstrated through various illustrative consequences and corollaries, emphasizing their potential impact in function theory and its applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this researh work, we establish a new subclass of analytic functions constructed by the Mittag-Leffler function that maps the open unit disc onto the region bounded by the Cardioid domain. Using a technique introduced by Miller and Mocanu, we investigate several Briot-Bouquet differential subordinations for this function class.</description>

      <title>Norm of the Hilbert matrix operator on logarithmically weighted Bloch and Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the exact value of the norm of the Hilbert matrix operator $\mathcal{H}$ acting from the classical Bloch space $\mathcal{B}$ into the logarithmically weighted Bloch space $\mathcal{B}_{\log}$, and show that it equals $\frac{3}{2}$; we also find that the norm from the space of bounded analytic functions $H^\infty$ into the logarithmically weighted Hardy space $H^{\infty}_{\log}$ is $1$. Furthermore, we establish both lower and upper bounds for the norm of $\mathcal{H}$ when it maps from the $\alpha$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha$ into the logarithmically weighted $\mathcal{B}^\alpha_{\log}$ with $1 &lt;\alpha &lt; 2$, and from the Hardy space $H^{1}$ into the logarithmically weighted Hardy space $H^{1}_{\log}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an application of the Faddeev-Henkin exponential ansatz and of the d-to-d-bar map on the boundary to inverse conductivity problem on a bordered Riemann surface in CP2. In our approach we use integral formulas for operator d-bar developed in [HP1]-[HP4] and integral formulas for holomorphic functions on Riemann surfaces from [P].</description>

      <title>Winding quotients for virtual period maps of rank 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illustrate a rank 1 model of virtual period maps and their associated winding quotient, where the winding quotient is a new phenomenon appeared in a recent study of virtual period maps and it requires a reformulation of the classical inversion problem for the period maps. We answer to the new inversion problem by introducing the q-multiplicatively periodic function, whose pull-back to the winding covering space is the Weierstrass p-function up to a correction by Eisenstein series E2, and which was used in recent mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Volumes of Subvarieties of Complex Ball Quotients and Sparsity of Rational Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X=\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^{n} $ be an $n$-dimensional complex ball quotient by a torsion-free non-uniform lattice $\Gamma$ whose parabolic subgroups are unipotent. We prove that the volumes of subvarieties of $X$ are controlled by the systole of $X,$ which is the length of the shortest closed geodesic of $X$.
  There are a number of arithmetic and geometric consequences: the systole of $X$ controls the growth rate of rational points on $X,$ uniformly in the field of definition. Also, we obtain effective global generation and very ampleness results for multiples of the canonical bundle $K_{\overline{X}},$ where $\overline{X}$ is the toroidal compactification of $X.$ These results follow from the bound we find for the Seshadri constant of $K_{\overline{X}}$ in terms of the systole.</description>
