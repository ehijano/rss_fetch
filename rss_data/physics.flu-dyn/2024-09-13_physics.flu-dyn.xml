      <title>Hammering at the entropy: A GENERIC-guided approach to learning polymeric rheological constitutive equations using PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a versatile framework that employs Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to discover the entropic contribution that leads to the constitutive equation for the extra-stress in rheological models of polymer solutions. In this framework the training of the Neural Network is guided by an evolution equation for the conformation tensor which is GENERIC-compliant. We compare two training methodologies for the data-driven PINN constitutive models: one trained on data from the analytical solution of the Oldroyd-B model under steady-state rheometric flows (PINN-rheometric), and another trained on in-silico data generated from complex flow CFD simulations around a cylinder that use the Oldroyd-B model (PINN-complex). The capacity of the PINN models to provide good predictions are evaluated by comparison with CFD simulations using the underlying Oldroyd-B model as a reference. Both models are capable of predicting flow behavior in transient and complex conditions; however, the PINN-complex model, trained on a broader range of mixed flow data, outperforms the PINN-rheometric model in complex flow scenarios. The geometry agnostic character of our methodology allows us to apply the learned PINN models to flows with different topologies than the ones used for training.</description>

      <title>Dual scale Residual-Network for turbulent flow sub grid scale resolving: A prior analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces generative Residual Networks (ResNet) as a surrogate Machine Learning (ML) tool for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) Sub Grid Scale (SGS) resolving. The study investigates the impact of incorporating Dual Scale Residual Blocks (DS-RB) within the ResNet architecture. Two LES SGS resolving models are proposed and tested for prior analysis test cases: a super-resolution model (SR-ResNet) and a SGS stress tensor inference model (SGS-ResNet). The SR-ResNet model task is to upscale LES solutions from coarse to finer grids by inferring unresolved SGS velocity fluctuations, exhibiting success in preserving high-frequency velocity fluctuation information, and aligning with higher-resolution LES solutions' energy spectrum. Furthermore, employing DS-RB enhances prediction accuracy and precision of high-frequency velocity fields compared to Single Scale Residual Blocks (SS-RB), evident in both spatial and spectral domains. The SR-ResNet model is tested and trained on filtered/downsampled 2-D LES planar jet injection problems at two Reynolds numbers, two jet configurations, and two upscale ratios. In the case of SGS stress tensor inference, both SS-RB and DS-RB exhibit higher prediction accuracy over the Smagorinsky model with reference to the true DNS SGS stress tensor, with DS-RB-based SGS-ResNet showing stronger statistical alignment with DNS data. The SGS-ResNet model is tested on a filtered/downsampled 2-D DNS isotropic homogenous decay turbulence problem. The adoption of DS-RB incurs notable increases in network size, training time, and forward inference time, with the network size expanding by over tenfold, and training and forward inference times increasing by approximately 0.5 and 3 times, respectively.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number, while the inclusion of surrounding coarse element neighbors was found to improve predictions at Re=1600, but not at Re=3200.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy of Transition Models for Gas Turbine Applications Through Data-Driven Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separated flow transition is a very popular phenomenon in gas turbines, especially low-pressure turbines (LPT). Low-fidelity simulations are often used for gas turbine design. However, they are unable to predict separated flow transition accurately. To improve the separated flow transition prediction for LPTs, the empirical relations that are derived for transition prediction need to be significantly modified. To achieve this, machine learning approaches are used to investigate a large number of functional forms using computational fluid dynamics-driven gene expression programming. These functional forms are investigated using a multi-expression multi-objective algorithm in terms of separation onset, transition onset, separation bubble length, wall shear stress, and pressure coefficient. The models generated after 177 generations show significant improvements over the baseline result in terms of the above parameters. All of the models developed improve the wall shear stress prediction by 40-70\% over the baseline laminar kinetic energy model. This method has immense potential to improve boundary layer transition prediction for gas turbine applications across several geometries and operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Direct Numerical Simulation of Particle Clustering and Turbulence Modulation: An Eulerian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Eulerian framework for the computation of turbulent compressible multiphase channel flows, specifically to assess turbulence modulation by dispersed particulate matter. By combining a modified low-dissipation numerical scheme for the carrier flow and a quadrature moment-based method for the particle phase, the turbulent statistics of the carrier flow and the fluctuations of the particle phase may be obtained as both are resolved as coupled fields. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate how this method resolves the turbulent statistics, kinetic energy, and drag modulation for moderate Reynolds numbers channel flows for the first time. Validation of our approach to the turbulent clean flow proves the applicability of the carrier flow low dissipation scheme for relatively low Mach number compressible flows. This study also rationalizes the computed drag modulation results using a simplified analytical approach, revealing how the particle migration towards the wall can affect the drag between the two phases at different Stokes numbers and particle loadings. Using our Eulerian approach, we also show the complex interplay between the particles and flow turbulence fluctuations by capturing the preferential clustering of particles in the turbulence streaks. This interplay leads to turbulent flow modulations similar to recent observations reported in prior computational works using Lagrangian simulations. Our study extends the applicability of Eulerian approaches to accurately study particle-fluid interactions in compressible turbulent flows by explicitly calculating the energy equations for both the particle phase and the carrier fluid motion.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic fluid flow in a slowly varying planar contraction: the role of finite extensibility on the pressure drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the steady viscoelastic fluid flow in slowly varying contracting channels of arbitrary shape and present a theory based on the lubrication approximation for calculating the flow rate-pressure drop relation at low and high Deborah ($De$) numbers. Unlike most prior theoretical studies leveraging the Oldroyd-B model, we describe the fluid viscoelasticity using a FENE-CR model and examine how the polymer chains' finite extensibility impacts the pressure drop. We employ the low-Deborah-number lubrication analysis to provide analytical expressions for the pressure drop up to $O(De^4)$. We further consider the ultra-dilute limit and exploit a one-way coupling between the parabolic velocity and elastic stresses to calculate the pressure drop of the FENE-CR fluid for arbitrary values of the Deborah number. Such an approach allows us to elucidate elastic stress contributions governing the pressure drop variations and the effect of finite extensibility for all $De$. We validate our theoretical predictions with two-dimensional numerical simulations and find excellent agreement. We show that, at low Deborah numbers, the pressure drop of the FENE-CR fluid monotonically decreases with $De$, similar to the previous results for the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P fluids. However, at high Deborah numbers, in contrast to a linear decrease for the Oldroyd-B fluid, the pressure drop of the FENE-CR fluid exhibits a non-monotonic variation due to finite extensibility, first decreasing and then increasing with $De$. Nevertheless, even at sufficiently high Deborah numbers, the pressure drop of the FENE-CR fluid in the ultra-dilute and lubrication limits is lower than the corresponding Newtonian pressure drop.</description>

      <title>Digital twin of a large-aspect-ratio Rayleigh-B\'enard experiment: Role of thermal boundary conditions, measurement errors and uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Albeit laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have proven themselves successful in enhancing our understanding of long-living large-scale flow structures in horizontally extended Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, some discrepancies with respect to their size and induced heat transfer remain. This study traces these discrepancies back to their origins. We start by generating a digital twin of one standard experimental set-up. This twin is subsequently simplified in steps to understand the effect of non-ideal thermal boundary conditions, and the experimental measurement procedure is mimicked using numerical data. Although this allows explaining the increased observed size of the flow structures in the experiment relative to past numerical simulations, our data suggests that the vertical velocity magnitude has been underestimated in the experiments. A subsequent re-assessment of the latter's original data reveals an incorrect calibration model. The re-processed data show a relative increase in $u_{z}$ of roughly $24 \%$, resolving the previously observed discrepancies. This digital twin of a laboratory experiment for thermal convection at Rayleigh numbers $\Ra = \left\{ 2, 4, 7 \right\} \times 10^{5}$, a Prandtl number $\Pr = 7.1$, and an aspect ratio $\Gamma = 25$ highlights the role of different thermal boundary conditions as well as a reliable calibration and measurement procedure.</description>

      <title>Analog-Based Forecasting of Turbulent Velocity: Relationship between Predictability and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of analog-based methodologies to predict the longitudinal velocity in a turbulent flow. The data used comes from hot wire experimental measurements from the Modane wind tunnel. We compared different methods and explored the impact of varying the number of analogs and their sizes on prediction accuracy. We illustrate that the innovation, defined as the difference between the true velocity value and the prediction value, highlights particularly unpredictable events that we directly link with extreme events of the velocity gradients and so to intermittency. This result indicates that while the estimator effectively seizes linear correlations, it fails to fully capture higher-order dependencies. The innovation underscores the presence of intermittency, revealing the limitations of current predictive models and suggesting directions for future improvements in turbulence forecasting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equations under location uncertainty and its approximations for ocean modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a stochastic version under location uncertainty of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The modelling under location uncertainty setting is used here to derive a physically consistent stochastic dynamical system for compressible flows. It relies on an extended stochastic version of the Reynolds transport theorem involving stochastic source terms. In a similar way as in the deterministic case, this conservation theorem is applied to density, momentum and total energy in order to obtain a transport equation of the primitive variables, i.e. density, velocity and temperature. For the modelling of ocean dynamics, the transport of mass fraction of species, such as salinity, is also considered. We show that performing low Mach and Boussinesq approximations to this more general set of equations allows us to recover previous versions of incompressible stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and the stochastic Boussinesq equations, respectively. Finally, we provide some research directions on the use of this general set of equations in the perspective of relaxing the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximation for ocean modelling.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical investigation of flashback in premixed hydrogen flames within perforated burners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting flashback represents a pivotal challenge in the development of innovative perforated burners for household appliances, especially for substituting natural gas with hydrogen as fuel. Most existing numerical studies have utilized two-dimensional (2D) simulations to investigate flashback in these burners, primarily to reduce computational costs. However, the inherent complexity of flashback phenomena suggests that 2D models may inadequately capture the flame dynamics, potentially leading to inaccurate estimations of flashback limits. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) simulations are employed to examine the impact of the actual slit shapes on the flashback velocities of hydrogen-premixed flames. Steady-state simulations are conducted to compute flashback velocities for three equivalence ratios ($\phi=0.6$, $0.8$, and $1.0$), investigating slits with fixed width and varying lengths. Additionally, transient simulations are performed to investigate the flashback dynamics. The results are compared with those from 2D configurations to assess the reliability of the infinite slit approximation. For stable flames, 2D simulations underpredict the burner plate temperature compared to slits with lengths typical of practical devices but match the 3D results as $L\to\infty$. Conversely, flashback velocities are consistently underpredicted in 2D simulations compared to 3D simulations, even as $L\to\infty$. This is due to the critical role of the slit ends in flashback dynamics, where preferential diffusion, the Soret effect, and higher preheating due to a higher surface-to-volume ratio trigger the initiation of flashback in those regions. These findings underscore the necessity of employing 3D simulations to accurately estimate the flashback velocities in domestic perforated burners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tangent Cylinders (TCs) have shaped our understanding of planetary dynamos and liquid cores. The Taylor-Proudman Constraint (TPC) due to planetary rotation creates these imaginary surfaces separating polar and equatorial regions but cannot explain the flows meandering through them. Here we establish and verify experimentally that magnetic fields aligned with rotation drive flows \emph{into} TCs, linked to the flows \emph{along} TCs by a \emph{magnetic} Taylor-Proudman constraint. This constraint explains and quantifies how magnetic fields reshape rotating flows in planetary interiors and magnetorotating flows in general.</description>

      <title>Enhanced bubble growth near an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frozen water might appear opaque since gas bubbles can get trapped in the ice during the freezing process. They nucleate and then grow near the advancing solidification front, due to the formation of a gas supersaturation region in its vicinity. A delicate interplay between the rate of mass transfer and the rate of freezing dictates the final shapes and sizes of the entrapped gas bubbles. In this work, we experimentally and numerically investigate the initial growth of such gas bubbles that nucleate and grow near the advancing ice front. We show that the initial growth of these bubbles is governed by diffusion and is enhanced due to a combination of the presence of the background gas concentration gradient and the motion of the approaching front. Additionally, we recast the problem into that of mass transfer to a moving spherical object in a homogeneous concentration field, finding good agreement between our experimental data and the existing scaling relations for that latter problem. Lastly, we address how fluid flow around the bubble might further affect this growth and qualitatively explore this through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of stochastic variations in bathymetry on the solutions of the thermal quasigeostrophic (TQG) equations. These stochastic perturbations generate a variety of different types of ensemble spread in the solution behaviour whilst also preserving the deterministic Lie Poisson structure and Casimir conservation laws. We numerically compare the solution sensitivity, to another type of structure-preserving stochastic perturbation where instead of bathymetry, the velocity is stochastically perturbed.</description>
