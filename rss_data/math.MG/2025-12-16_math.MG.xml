      <title>Epimorphism classes and relatively maximal metrics in large-scale geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider epimorphisms and several variant notions -- split, effective, regular, strong, and extremal -- and determine which of these coincide in the metric coarse and coarsely Lipschitz categories. In particular, we characterise extremal epis in the coarsely Lipschitz category via a relative maximality condition on the codomain metric; this can be viewed as a morphism-relative analogue of Rosendal's maximal metrics for topological groups.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Busemann-Petty Problem for Arbitrary Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Busemann-Petty problem asks whether smaller central hyperplane sections of origin-symmetric convex bodies necessarily imply smaller total volume. Zvavitch studied this question for arbitrary measures with continuous even densities, providing sufficient conditions for affirmative cases in terms of the distributional behavior of the ratio between the densities involved. We refine this result by extending it to a broader class of distributions and allowing a distinct pair of densities for each body, one for hyperplane sections and another for the full volume. We also present some examples illustrating cases not covered by previous results.</description>

      <title>Measuring Asymptotic Convergence: A Unified Framework from Isotropic Infinity to Anisotropic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point \omega_A to the space A and define convergence a \to \omega_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts.</description>

      <title>Exponential Absolute Minimizing extension and biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the variational structure of the biased infinity Laplacian by introducing a notion of the $\beta$\textit{-Exponential Absolute Minimizing Extension} ($\beta$--AM) on arbitrary length space, which absolutely minimizing the exponential slope
  $$ L^{\beta}_u (E) := \beta \sup_{x,y \in E} \frac{u(y) - e^{-\beta |x-y|} u(x)}{1- e^{-\beta |x-y|}}. $$We also define the corresponding Exponential McShane-Whitney-type extension, and $\beta$-biased convexity, which equivalently characterize $\beta$-AM and may be of independent interest. These generalize the classical Absolute Minimizing Lipschitz Extension as a special case when $\beta = 0$. In Euclidean space with Euclidean norm, this corresponds to the Aronsson equation with Hamiltonian \[ H(u, \nabla u) = |\nabla u| + \beta u, \] equivalently viscosity solutions of $\Delta_{\infty}^{\beta} u = 0$. We show that $\beta$-AM arises as the continuum value of a biased tug-of-war game. Analogous to the unbiased case, we derive various properties of this extension. As an application, we further show that the linear blow-up property holds for biased infinity harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Hadwiger's conjecture for cap bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadwiger's covering conjecture is that every $n$-dimensional convex body can be covered by at most $2^n$ of its smaller positive homothetic copies, with $2^n$ copies required only for affine images of $n$-cube. Convex hull of a ball and an external point is called a spike. The union of finitely many spikes of a ball is a cap body if it is a convex set. In this note, we confirm the Hadwiger's conjecture for the class of cap bodies in all dimensions, bridging recently established cases of $n=3$ and large $n$. The proof uses probabilistic techniques, and additionally, for moderate dimensions $4\le n \le 15$, integer linear programming performed with computer assistance.</description>

      <title>Mathematical exploration and discovery at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>
