      <title>Online Correlation Clustering: Simultaneously Optimizing All $\ell_p$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly, in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all $\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all $\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the $\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the $\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline "all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order (RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially $O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$- norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.</description>

      <title>Affine Predicate Geometry: A Courcelle-Type Metatheorem for Rank-Bounded Pseudo-Boolean Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many discrete optimization problems -- including low-rank quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), trimmed covariance, and cardinality-constrained pseudo-Boolean programs -- share a common structure: the gain of any elementary move (bit-flip or swap) can be expressed as an affine form in a low-dimensional feature map $\phi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^R$. We call this the Affine--Predicate Condition, and show that it captures all rank-structured pseudo-Boolean objectives, including higher-order forms via multilinear lifting. We prove an Affine--Predicate Meta--Theorem: under this condition, every locally optimal solution must lie in a chamber of a central hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{R}^{R+1}$, defined by the zero-sets of these affine gains. These chambers can be enumerated in $m^{O(R)}$ time, where $m$ is the number of elementary feasible directions. Consequently, exact optimization is in XP time $n^{O(R)}$ in the effective rank $R$, even under uniform matroid (cardinality) constraints. As a corollary, we obtain the first unified $n^{O(r)}$ exact algorithm for rank-$r$ QUBO and its cardinality-constrained extension. This establishes rank as a structural parameter for discrete optimization, analogous to treewidth in algorithmic graph theory and Courcelle-type meta-theorems.</description>

      <title>A quasi-polynomial bound for the minimal excluded minors for a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of their graph minor project, Robertson and Seymour showed in 1990 that the class of graphs that can be embedded in a given surface can be characterized by a finite set of minimal excluded minors. However, their proof, because existential, does not provide any information on these excluded minors. Seymour proved in 1993 the first and, until now, only known upper bound on the order of the minimal excluded minors for a given surface. This bound is double exponential in the Euler genus $g$ of the surface and, therefore, very far from the $\Omega(g)$ lower bound on the maximal order of minimal excluded minors for a surface and most likely far from the best possible bound. More than thirty years later, this paper finally makes progress in lowering this bound to a quasi-polynomial in the Euler genus of the surface.
  The main catalyzer to reach a quasi-polynomial bound is a breakthrough on the characteristic size of a forbidden structure for a minimal excluded minor $G$ for a surface of Euler genus $g$: although it is not hard to show that $G$ does not contain $O(g)$ disjoint cycles that are contractible and nested in some embedding of $G$ as demonstrated by Seymour, this bound can be lowered to $O(\log g)$ which is essential to obtain the quasi-polynomial bound in this paper.
  As subsidiary results, we also improve the current bound on the treewidth of a minimal excluded minor $G$ for a surface by improving the first and, until now, only known bound provided by Seymour.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion: When Is the Diameter Bound Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study when the diameter bound s is essential for the tractability of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion problem. Given a graph G = (V, E) and integers k and s, the goal is to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has diameter at most s. This problem generalizes Cluster Edge Deletion (s = 1) and captures distance-bounded clustering tasks.
  Montecchiani et al. (Information and Computation, 2023) proved that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by s + tw(G) and asked whether dependence on s is necessary. We answer negatively by showing W[1]-hardness when parameterized by pathwidth (and hence by treewidth), proving that s cannot in general be dropped. On the positive side, we show FPT algorithms parameterized by treedepth, neighborhood diversity, or cluster vertex deletion number, extending results of Italiano et al. (Algorithmica, 2023) and Komusiewicz and Uhlmann (SOFSEM, 2011). We also show that no polynomial kernel exists when parameterized by vertex cover number, even for s = 2.
  Classically, the problem is NP-hard on split graphs for s = 2, complementing the polynomial case s = 1. We give an FPT bicriteria approximation scheme running in f(k, 1/epsilon) * n^{O(1)} that outputs a set of at most k deletions whose components have diameter at most (1 + epsilon)s. Finally, we introduce a directed generalization, s-Club Cluster Arc Deletion, extending the undirected case to reachability distances, and show it is W[1]-hard in parameter k even on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free Edge Deletion on graphs having a product structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, a graph is \emph{$\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free} if it has no subgraph isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{F}$. We present a fixed-parameter linear-time algorithm that decides whether a planar graph can be made $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free by deleting at most $k$ vertices or $k$ edges, where the parameters are $k$, $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert$, and the maximum number of vertices in a member of $\mathcal{F}$. The running time of our algorithm is double-exponential in the parameters, which is faster than the algorithm obtained by applying the first-order model checking result for graphs of bounded twin-width.
  To obtain this result, we develop a unified framework for designing algorithms for this problem on graphs with a ``product structure.'' Using this framework, we also design algorithms for other graph classes that generalize planar graphs. Specifically, the problem admits a fixed-parameter linear time algorithm on disk graphs of bounded local radius, and a fixed-parameter almost-linear time algorithm on graphs of bounded genus.
  Finally, we show that our result gives a tight fixed-parameter algorithm in the following sense: Even when $\mathcal{F}$ consists of a single graph $F$ and the input is restricted to planar graphs, it is unlikely to drop any parameters $k$ and $\lvert V(F) \rvert$ while preserving fixed-parameter tractability, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails.</description>
