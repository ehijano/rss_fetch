      <title>Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Fractal Illusions: An Experimental Study of Long-Range Sentence-Length Correlations in Randomly Generated Natural Language Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study re-evaluates the assumption that long-range correlations in sentence length are a fundamental feature of natural language and a marker of literary style. While previous research has suggested that punctuation marks--particularly full stops--generate structural regularities in narrative texts, our experiments challenge this view. Using Chinese as the primary language, supplemented with English, we constructed randomized linguistic sequences through three distinct methods. Surprisingly, these randomized texts also exhibit long-range correlations in sentence length, some even with stronger fractal characteristics than those found in canonical literary works. These findings suggest that the presence of long-range correlations in sentence length is not sufficient to indicate authorial intention, structural depth, or literary value. We argue that punctuation-induced long-range correlations have limited value for literary stylistic analysis and cannot be considered a fundamental characteristic of human writing.</description>

      <title>SNIC bifurcation and its Application to MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical means, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The method of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting non-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse vibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small amplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam eigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations, causes it reach a state of "injection pulling" - an effect that occurs when one harmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in a frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation, rendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the problem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that translates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to the dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to mathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed of functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical assumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase equation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These assumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively simple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution. Computerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and compare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the theory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be valid in extracting the comb.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Thermalization, and Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically investigate whether quantum thermalization occurs during the time evolution induced by a non-local Hamiltonian whose spectra exhibit integrability. This non-local and integrable Hamiltonian is constructed by combining two types of integrable Hamiltonians. From the time dependence of entanglement entropy and mutual information, we find that non-locality can evolve the system into the typical state. On the other hand, the time dependence of logarithmic negativity shows that the non-locality can destroy the quantum correlation. These findings suggest that the quantum thermalization induced by the non-local Hamiltonian does not require the quantum chaoticity of the system.</description>

      <title>On-chip wave chaos for photonic extreme learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in demand for scalable and energy efficient artificial neural networks has put the focus on novel hardware solutions. Integrated photonics offers a compact, parallel and ultra-fast information processing platform, specially suited for extreme learning machine (ELM) architectures. Here we experimentally demonstrate a chip-scale photonic ELM based on wave chaos interference in a stadium microcavity. By encoding the input information in the wavelength of an external single-frequency tunable laser source, we leverage the high sensitivity to wavelength of injection in such photonic resonators. We fabricate the microcavity with direct laser writing of SU-8 polymer on glass. A scattering wall surrounding the stadium operates as readout layer, collecting the light associated with the cavity's leaky modes. We report uncorrelated and aperiodic behavior in the speckles of the scattering barrier from a high resolution scan of the input wavelength. Finally, we characterize the system's performance at classification in four qualitatively different benchmark tasks. As we can control the number of output nodes of our ELM by measuring different parts of the scattering barrier, we demonstrate the capability to optimize our photonic ELM's readout size to the performance required for each task.</description>

      <title>Correcting model error bias in estimations of neuronal dynamics from time series observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuron models built from experimental data have successfully predicted observed voltage oscillations within and beyond training range. A tantalising prospect is the possibility of estimating the unobserved dynamics of ion channels which is largely inaccessible to experiment, from membrane voltage recordings. The main roadblock here is our lack of knowledge of the equations governing biological neurons which forces us to rely on surrogate models and parameter estimates biassed by model error. Error correction algorithms are therefore needed to infer both observed and unobserved dynamics, and ultimately the actual parameters of a biological neuron. Here we use a recurrent neural network to correct the outputs of a surrogate Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. The reservoir-surrogate HH model hybrid was trained on the voltage oscillations of a reference HH model and its driving current waveform. Out of the six reservoir-surrogate model architectures investigated, we identify one that most accurately recovers the reference membrane voltage and ion channel dynamics. The reservoir was thus effective in correcting model error in an externally driven nonlinear oscillator and in reconstructing the dynamics of both observed and unobserved state variables from the reference model mimicking an actual neuron.</description>

      <title>Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</description>
