      <title>Enhanced Graphene-Water Thermal Transport via Edge Functionalization without Compromising In-Plane Thermal Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial thermal transport between graphene and water plays a critical role in a wide range of thermal and energy applications. Although chemical functionalization can significantly enhance graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance, it often degrades graphene's intrinsic in-plane phonon transport. In this work, we perform a systematic deep neural network molecular dynamics study comparing edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbons with surface-functionalized graphene in aqueous environments. We demonstrate that functionalizing only 10% of the ribbon edges with hydroxyl groups increases the graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance by more than eightfold, primarily due to strengthened interfacial interactions and improved wettability at the edges. In contrast to basal-plane oxidation, edge functionalization largely preserves in-plane thermal conductivity. Importantly, hydroxyl edge groups exert competing effects on phonon transport: they introduce additional boundary scattering that suppresses heat conduction, while simultaneously passivating dangling bonds at bare edges, thereby reducing phonon localization and edge-induced scattering. This competition leads to a non-monotonic dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity on edge functionalization ratio. These results establish edge functionalization as an effective strategy for enhancing graphene-water interfacial thermal transport without sacrificing intrinsic phonon transport properties.</description>

      <title>Stack of correlated insulating states in bilayer graphene kagome superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-based systems have emerged as a rich platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena-including superconductivity, magnetism, and correlated insulating behavior-arising from flat electronic bands that enhance many-body interactions. Realizing such flat bands has thus far relied primarily on moir\'e graphene superlattices or rhombohedral stacking graphene systems, both of which face challenges in reproducibility and tunability. Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands. As temperature increases, these correlated gaps collapse, signaling the thermal suppression of interaction-driven states. Continuum-model calculations confirm the formation of multiple flat minibands and reproduce the observed evolution of band reconstruction. Our results establish dielectric-patterned graphene superlattices as a robust and controllable architecture for realizing flat-band-induced correlated phenomena beyond moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Photophysical properties of Eu3+ complexes approaching electronic contact to a metal surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of rare-earth complexes in electrically driven light sources poses a series of challenges that require specific optimization of the molecular photophysical properties. Here, we present a report on films of three different Eu3+ complexes characterized in terms of emission spectra and fluorescence decay. We compare molecular complexes in powder form and sublimed films, in films on glass and on a metal surface, and in films of thicknesses down to less than 3 nm (&lt; 3 ML), approaching electrical coupling. Our photoluminescence experiments supported by scanning tunneling microscopy of sub-monolayers indicate that Eu3+(trensal) complexes are less affected by sublimation and more stable on the metal surface than typical beta diketonate complexes, making them promising candidates for electroluminescence devices.</description>

      <title>Transition between one- and two-dimensional topology in a Chern insulator of finite width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology in quantum systems is typically considered in infinite crystals in one, two, or higher integer dimensions. Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.</description>

      <title>Confinement Epitaxy of Large-Area Two-Dimensional Sn at the Graphene/SiC Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement epitaxy beneath graphene stabilizes exotic material phases by restricting vertical growth and altering lateral diffusion, conditions unattainable on bare substrates. However, achieving long-range interfacial order while maintaining high-quality graphene remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-area quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) via the intercalation of a two-dimensional (2D) Sn. While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Selective Phonon Coupling in a Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the optical response of semiconductors, yet disentangling multiple coupling channels in lead halide perovskites remains challenging. We investigate CsPbBr3 microcrystals using photoluminescence, Raman and reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature, revealing the simultaneous presence of high-energy and Rashba excitons, each accompanied by distinct phonon replica series. High-energy exciton replicas are uniquely spaced by approximately 9 meV, whereas Rashba exciton replicas exhibit a characteristic approximately 6 meV spacing, indicating the specificity of the exciton-phonon coupling. Unsupervised machine learning applied to a large low-temperature photoluminescence dataset reveals these replica features are prevalent. With increasing temperature, replica features broaden and merge, evolving into a dominant longitudinal optical phonon coupling regime at room temperature. This work establishes direct spectroscopic evidence for concurrent, exciton-specific phonon coupling within a single material, offering new pathways to engineer light-matter interactions for optoelectronic and phonon-photon-based quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>Exceptional horns in $n$-root graphene and Lieb photonic ring lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices whose Bloch spectra are $n$th roots of those of Hermitian parent two-dimensional (2D) lattices, namely graphene and the Lieb lattice. The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an "exceptional horn" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\sim\vert \mathbf{q}\vert^{\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\sim\phi^{\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$. Finally, we propose a realistic photonic implementation based on coupled ring resonators with a split configuration of optical gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Moss rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic devices depend critically on the dielectric materials from which they are made, with higher refractive indices and lower absorption losses enabling new functionalities and higher performance. However, these two material properties are intrinsically linked through the empirical Moss rule, which states that the refractive index of a dielectric decreases as its band gap energy increases. Materials that surpass this rule, termed super-Mossian dielectrics, combine large refractive indices with wide optical transparency and are therefore ideal candidates for advanced photonic applications. This Review surveys the expanding landscape of high-index dielectric and semiconductor materials, with a particular focus on those that surpass the Moss rule. We discuss how electronic band structures with a large joint density of states near the band edge give rise to super-Mossian behavior and how first-principles computational screening can accelerate their discovery. Finally, we establish how the refractive index sets the performance limits of nanoresonators, waveguides, and metasurfaces, highlighting super-Mossian dielectrics as a promising route toward the next performance leap in photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Birefringence-Driven Anisotropic $\alpha$-MoO3 Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many anisotropic layered materials, despite their strong in-plane birefringence, exhibit substantial visible absorption, which severely restricts cavity lengths and hinders the observation of purely birefringence-governed optical phenomena. Here, we realize a birefringence-driven anisotropic optical cavity using $\alpha$-MoO3 flakes, capitalizing on their ultralow optical loss and pronounced in-plane birefringence. Using angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, we observe a mode-sensitive enhancement of anisotropy, dependent on both flake thickness and Raman shift. A unified model that incorporates the intrinsic Raman tensor, birefringence, and chromatic dispersion accurately reproduces the experimental data, elucidating how cavity resonances at both excitation and scattered wavelengths interact. Within this framework, the intrinsic phonon anisotropy is quantified, providing invaluable insights for accurately predicting ARPR responses and identifying crystallographic orientation. This work provides fundamental insights into birefringence-governed cavities and opens avenues for high-performance birefringent optics and cavity-enhanced anisotropic phenomena.</description>

      <title>$p$-wave magnet driven field-free Josephson diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Entropy spectroscopy of a bilayer graphene quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the entropy change of charge transitions in an electrostatically defined quantum dot in bilayer graphene. Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a two-fold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a non-degenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a three-fold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele type spin--orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our work demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices build in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</description>

      <title>Effects of interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the shape and dynamics of magnetic twin-skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing information due to their high stability and easy manipulation by spin-polarized currents. Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic sub-band splitting mechanisms in strained HgTe: a first principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mercury telluride is a canonical material for realizing topological phases, yet a full understanding of its electronic structure remains challenging due to subtle competing effects. Using first-principles calculations and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ modelling, we study its topological phase diagram under strain. We show that linearly $k$-dependent higher-order $C_4$ strain terms are essential for capturing the correct low-energy behaviour. These terms lead to a nontrivial $k$-dependence of the sub-band splitting arising from the interplay of strain and bulk inversion asymmetry. This explains the camel-back feature in the tensile regime and supports the emergence of a Weyl semimetal phase under compressive strain.</description>

Abstract: We report large $\pi$-state critical current densities, $J_c(\pi)$, in Nb/Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$/Nb Josephson junctions at Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ thicknesses near the first $\pi$-state. We observe oscillations in the critical current with ferromagnetic barrier thickness consistent with a $0$-$\pi$ transition. For a junction with a 9.4~nm Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ barrier, we obtain $J_c(\pi) = 410~\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 4.2~K, exceeding values reported in prior PdNi-based studies. Magnetization measurements on continuous films, together with coercivity tests on patterned arrays, confirm that Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, enabling zero-field operation without magnetic initialization. The combination of large $J_c(\pi)$ and intrinsic anisotropy establishes Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ as a promising barrier material for passive $\pi$-shifters in superconducting digital logic and qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>K-ion intercalation memristors in prussian blue analogs revealed by C-AFM for Non-Volatile memory and Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04724</link>

Abstract: K-ion intercalation in Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) is a well-established charge storage mechanism in potassium-ion batteries; here, we demonstrate that this same ion intercalation process is the basis for nanoscale resistive switching behavior in PBA-base memristive devices. Using C-AFM, we directly visualize and electrically control this intercalation process within sub-100 nm volumes, revealing reversible, localized conductance modulation driven by K-ion intercalation and Fe^(2+)/Fe^(3+) redox reconfiguration. This nanoscale operability highlights the exceptional potential of PBAs for high-scalable and low-dimension memristor-based devices integration. Due to their modular composition, PBAs constitute a chemically rich, earth-abundant materials platform whose electronic and ionic properties can be precisely tuned for specific device functions. K-ion intercalation PBA-based memristor devices, with their single-step, aqueous, and room-temperature fabrication, enable low-cost, large-scale processing compatible with CMOS, without any additional post-fabrication processing. Our findings establish PBAs as a new class of intercalation memristors with scalable nanoscale switching and exceptional materials versatility, toward highly integrated neuromorphic and non-volatile memory technologies. This work provides the first demonstration of intercalation-driven resistive switching under ultrafast voltage sweeps, with PW operating up to 200 V/s and PB up to 50 V/s. This unprecedented speed establishes PBAs as a distinct, high-rate class of K-ion intercalation memristors suitable for fast, high-density neuromorphic and memory applications.</description>

      <title>Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.</description>
