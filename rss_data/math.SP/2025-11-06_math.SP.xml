      <title>Random Schr\"odinger operator with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the localization theory of random Schr\"odinger operators with singular single-site distributions, focusing on two regimes: (i) H\"older-continuous laws, where quantitative Wegner estimates enable the classical multiscale analysis (MSA); and (ii) purely atomic (Bernoulli) laws, where the failure of spectral averaging is overcome via quantitative unique continuation principles (UCP). Our discussion covers both lattice and continuum settings and highlights the analytic and combinatorial mechanisms that replace regularity of the single-site measure.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg's S-matrix program and Feynman's divergence problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis, maximum principles and shape optimization for nonlinear superposition operators of mixed fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to investigate the spectral properties, maximum principles, and shape optimization problems for a broad class of nonlinear ``superposition operators" defined as continuous superpositions of operators of mixed fractional order, modulated by a signed finite Borel measure on the unit interval. This framework encompasses, as particular cases, mixed local and nonlocal operators such as $-\Delta_p+(-\Delta_p)^s$, finite (possibly infinite) sums of fractional $p$-Laplacians with different orders, as well as operators involving fractional Laplacians with ``wrong" signs.
  The main findings, obtained through variational techniques, concern the spectral analysis of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem associated with general superposition operators with special emphasis on various properties of the first eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenfunction.
  We establish weak and strong maximum principles for positive superposition operators by introducing an appropriate notion of the {\it nonlocal tail} for this class of superposition operators and deriving a logarithmic estimate, both of which are of independent interest. Utilizing these newly developed tools, we further investigate the spectral properties of such superposition operators and prove that the first eigenvalue is isolated. Moreover, we show that the eigenfunctions corresponding to positive eigenvalues are globally bounded and that they change sign when associated with higher eigenvalues. In addition, we demonstrate that the second eigenvalue is well-defined and provide the mountain pass characterization.
  Finally, we address shape optimization problems, in particular, the Faber--Krahn inequality associated with the principal frequency associated with the superposition operators.</description>

      <title>A new proof of the Lemmens-Seidel conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof of the Lemmens-Seidel conjecture on the maximum number of equiangular lines with a common angle $\arccos(1/5)$. This conjecture was previously resolved by Cao, Koolen, Lin, and Yu in 2022 through an analysis involving forbidden subgraphs for the smallest Seidel eigenvalue $-5$. Our new proof is based on bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities of graphs with degree no larger than $14$. To control the maximum degree of the graph associated with equiangular lines, we employ a recent inequality of Balla derived by matrix projection techniques. Our strategy also leads to a new proof for the classical result obtained by Lemmens and Seidel in 1973 for the case where the common angle is $\arccos(1/3)$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the second eigenspace of the interchange process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral gap theorem of Caputo, Liggett, and Richthammer states that on any connected graph equipped with edge weights, the 2nd eigenvalue of the interchange process equals the 2nd eigenvalue of the random walk process. In this work we characterize the 2nd eigenspace of the interchange process. We prove that this eigenspace is uniquely determined by the 2nd eigenvectors of the random walk process on every connected weighted graph except the $4$-cycle with uniform edge weights. The key to our proof is an induction scheme on the number of vertices, and involves the octopus (in)equality, representation theoretic computations, and graph Laplacian computations.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of dense hypergraph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a spectral theory for hypergraph limits. We prove the convergence of the spectra of adjacency and Laplacian matrices for hypergraph sequences converging in the $1$-cut metric. On the other hand, we give examples of matrix operators associated with hypergraphs whose spectra are not continuous with respect to the $1$-cut metric. Furthermore, we show that these operators are continuous with respect to other cut norms.</description>
