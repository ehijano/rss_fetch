      <title>Actions of Fell bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study actions of Fell bundles over discrete groups on Hilbert bundles. Many examples of such actions are presented. We discuss the connection with positive definite bundle maps between Fell bundles, culminating in the unital case in a Gelfand-Raikov type theorem. We also use these actions to construct C*-correspondences over cross-sectional C*-algebras of Fell bundles.</description>

      <title>Understanding Quantum Instruments Through the Analysis of $C^*$-Convexity and Their Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11785v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.</description>

      <title>Algebra bundles, projective flatness and rationally-deformed tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the \v{C}ech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively H{\o}egh-Krohn-Skjelbred.</description>

      <title>On two notions of torsion and metric compatibility of connections in noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the notions of metric-compatibility and torsion of a connection in the frameworks of Beggs-Majid and Mesland-Rennie. It follows that for $\ast$-preserving connections, compatibility with a real metric in the sense of Beggs-Majid corresponds to Hermitian connections in the sense of Mesland-Rennie. If the calculus is quasi-tame, the torsion zero conditions are equivalent. A combination of these results proves the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connections in the sense of Mesland-Rennie for unitary cocycle deformations of a large class of Riemannian manifolds as well as the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi on all quantized irreducible flag manifolds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic lifting for completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.09176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be $C^*$-algebras with $A$ separable, let $I$ be an ideal in $B$, and let $\psi\colon A\to B/I$ be a completely positive contractive linear map. We show that there is a continuous family $\Theta_t\colon A\to B$, for $t\in [1,\infty)$, of lifts of $\psi$ that are asymptotically linear, asymptotically completely positive and asymptotically contractive. If $\psi$ is of order zero, then $\Theta_t$ can be chosen to have this property asymptotically. If $A$ and $B$ carry continuous actions of a second countable locally compact group $G$ such that $I$ is $G$-invariant and $\psi$ is equivariant, we show that the family $\Theta_t$ can be chosen to be asymptotically equivariant. If a linear completely positive lift for $\psi$ exists, we can arrange that $\Theta_t$ is linear and completely positive for all $t\in [1,\infty)$. In the equivariant setting, if $A$, $B$ and $\psi$ are unital, we show that asymptotically linear unital lifts are only guaranteed to exist if $G$ is amenable. This leads to a new characterization of amenability in terms of the existence of asymptotically equivariant unital sections for quotient maps.</description>

      <title>A martingale approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus that is, like the classical theory, based primarily on the martingale property. Using this approach, we introduce a general theory of stochastic integration and quadratic (co)variation for a certain class of noncommutative processes, analogous to semimartingales, that includes both the $q$-Brownian motions and classical matrix-valued Brownian motions. As applications, we obtain Burkholder--Davis--Gundy inequalities (with $p \geq 2$) for continuous-time noncommutative martingales and a noncommutative It\^{o}'s formula for "adapted $C^2$ maps," including trace $\ast$-polynomial maps and operator functions associated to the noncommutative $C^2$ scalar functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ introduced by Nikitopoulos, as well as the more general multivariate tracial noncommutative $C^2$ functions introduced by Jekel, Li, and Shlyakhtenko.</description>

      <title>Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations, ideals and decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</description>

      <title>Continuous Selection of Unitaries in II$_1$ Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove continuous-valued analogues of the basic fact that Murray-von Neumann subequivalence of projections in II$_1$ factors is completely determined by tracial evaluations. We moreover use this result to solve the so-called trace problem in the case of factorial trivial $W^\ast$-bundles whose base space has covering dimension at most 1. Our arguments are based on applications of a continuous selection theorem due to Michael to von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Crossed products by compact group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce compact group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property. This concept simultaneously generalizes finite group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property and compact group actions with the tracial Rokhlin property (in the sense of the Elliott program). Under this framework, we prove that simplicity, pure infiniteness, tracial $\mathcal{Z}$-stability and the combination of nuclearity and $\mathcal{Z}$-stability can be transferred from the original algebra to the crossed product. We also show that the radius of comparison of the fixed point algebra does not exceed that of the original algebra. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between our definitions and natural generalizations of the finite group case in non-Elliott program settings. Finally, we provide a nontrivial example of a compact group action with the weak tracial Rokhlin property with comparison: an action of $(S_2)^\mathbb{N}$ on the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$. Since $\mathcal{Z}$ contains no nontrivial projections, this action does not possess the tracial Rokhlin property.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Products of Countably Infinitely Many Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $r \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ be a fixed number and let $P_j\,\, (1 \leq j\leq r )$ be the projection onto the closed subspace $\mathcal{M}_j$ of $\mathscr{H}$. We are interested in studying the sequence $P_{i_1}, P_{i_2}, \ldots \in\{P_1, \ldots, P_r\}$. A significant problem is to demonstrate conditions under which the sequence $\{P_{i_n}\cdots P_{i_2}P_{i_1}x\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges strongly or weakly to $Px$ for any $x\in\mathscr{H}$, where $P$ is the projection onto the intersection $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_1\cap \ldots \cap \mathcal{M}_r$. Several mathematicians have presented their insights on this matter since von Neumann established his result in the case of $r=2$. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to a question posed by M. Sakai. We present a result concerning random products of countably infinitely many projections (the case $r=\infty$) incorporating the notion of pseudo-periodic function.</description>

      <title>The Levi-Civita connection and Chern connections for cocycle deformations of K\"{a}hler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider unitary cocycle deformations of covariant $\ast$-differential calculi. We prove that complex structures, holomorphic bimodules and Chern connections on the deformed calculus are twists of their untwisted counterparts. Moreover, for cocycle deformations of a class of classical K\"ahler manifolds, the Levi-Civita connection on the space of one forms of the deformed calculus is shown to be a direct sum of the Chern connections on the twisted holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic bimodules. Our class of examples also include cocycle deformations of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi.</description>
