      <title>Knobs and dials of retrieving JWST transmission spectra. I. The importance of p-T profile complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of using multipoint p-T profiles of varying complexity on the retrieval of synthetically generated hot Jupiter transmission spectra modelled after state-of-the-art observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-39~b with JWST. We perform homogenised atmospheric retrievals with the TauREx retrieval framework on a sample of synthetically generated transmission spectra, accounting for varying cases of underlying p-T profiles, cloud-top pressures, and expected noise levels. These retrievals are performed using a fixed-pressure multipoint p-T prescription with increasing complexity, ranging from isothermal to an eleven-point profile. We evaluate the performance of the retrievals based on the Bayesian model evidence, and the accuracy of the retrievals compared to the known input parameters. We find that performing atmospheric retrievals using an isothermal prescription for the pressure-temperature profile consistently results in wrongly retrieved atmospheric parameters when compared to the known input parameters. For an underlying p-T profile with a fully positive lapse rate, we find that a two-point profile is sufficient to retrieve the known atmospheric parameters, while under the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion, we find that a more complex profile is necessary. Our investigation shows that, for a data quality scenario mirroring state-of-the-art observations of a hot Jupiter with JWST, an isothermal p-T prescription is insufficient to correctly retrieve the known atmospheric parameters. We find a model complexity preference dependent on the underlying pressure-temperature structure, but argue that a p-T prescription on the complexity level of a four-point profile should be preferred. This represents the overlap between the lowest number of free parameters and highest model preference in the cases investigated in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our Solar System includes the Sun, eight major planets and their moons, along with numerous asteroids, comets, and dust particles, collectively known as the small Solar System bodies. Small bodies are relics from the birth of the Solar System and offer valuable insights into planetary formation and the origins of life. This chapter explores this important component of our Solar System, discussing the formation and evolution of key small body populations and their interrelations.</description>

      <title>Classifications for Exoplanet and Exoplanetary Systems -- Could it be developed? I. Exoplanet classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a star is described as a spectral class G2V, we know its approximate mass, temperature, age, and size. At more than 5,700 exoplanets discovered, it is a natural developmental step to establish a classification for them, such as for example, the Harvard classification for stars. This exoplanet classification has to be easily interpreted and present the most relevant information about them and divides them into groups based on certain characteristics. We propose an exoplanet classification, which using an easily readable code, may inform you about a exoplanet's main characteristics. The suggested classification code contains four parameters by which we can quickly determine the range of temperature, mass, density and their eccentricity. The first parameter concerns the mass of an exoplanet in the form of the units of the mass of other known planets, where e.g. M represents the mass of Mercury, E that of Earth, N Neptune, or J Jupiter. The second parameter is the mean Dyson temperature of the extoplanet's orbit, for which we established four main classes: F represents the Frozen class, W the Water class, G the Gaseous class, and R the Roaster class. The third parameter is eccentricity and the fourth parameter is surface attribute which is defined as the bulk density of the exoplanet, where g represents a gaseous planet, w - water planet, t - terrestrial planet, i - iron planet and s - super dense planet. The classification code for Venus, could be EG0t (E - mass in the range of the mass of the Earth, G - Gaseous class, temperature in the range from 450 to 1000 K, 0 - circular or nearly circular orbit, t - terrestrial surface), for Earth it could be EW0t (W - Water class - a possible Habitable zone). This classification is very helpful in, for example, quickly delimiting if a planet can be found in the Habitable zone; if it is terrestrial or not.</description>

      <title>Lunar References Systems, Frames and Time-scales in the context of the ESA Programme Moonlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lunar reference systems represent a fundamental aspect of lunar exploration. This paper presents a review of the topic in the context of the ESA lunar programme, MoonLight. This paper describes the current state of the art in the definition of the lunar reference frame and introduces TCL, a lunar time scale based on IAU resolutions. It also proposes several possible implementations of this time scale for orbiting and ground-based clocks. Finally, it provides an assessment of the improvement of the lunar reference frame that would result from the addition of lunar retro-reflectors on the Moon surface and the use of orbiter altimetry. This document is an appendix dedicated to lunar reference system definition of a more global document dedicated to the presentation of new concepts in orbit determination and time synchronization of a lunar radio navigation system.</description>

      <title>Ejected Particles after Impact Splash on Mars: Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the RoadMap project we investigated the microphysical aspects of particle collisions during saltation on the Martian surface in laboratory experiments. Following the size distribution of ejected particles, their aerodynamic properties and aggregation status upon ejection, we now focus on the electrification and charge distribution of ejected particles. We analyzed rebound and ejection trajectories of grains in a vacuum setup with a strong electric field of 100 kV/m and deduced particle charges from their acceleration. The ejected particles have sizes of about 10 to 100 microns. They carry charges up to $10^5$ e or charge densities up to $&gt; 10^7$ e/mm$^2$. Within the given size range, we find a small bias towards positive charges.</description>

      <title>The Arpu Kuilpu Meteorite: In-depth characterization of an H5 chondrite delivered from a Jupiter Family Comet orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia, the Desert Fireball Network detected a fireball on the night of 1 June 2019 (7:30 pm local time), and six weeks later recovered a single meteorite (42 g) named Arpu Kuilpu. This meteorite was then distributed to a consortium of collaborating institutions to be measured and analyzed by a number of methodologies including: SEM-EDS, EPMA, ICP-MS, gamma-ray spectrometry, ideal gas pycnometry, magnetic susceptibility measurement, {\mu}CT, optical microscopy, and accelerator and noble gas mass spectrometry techniques. These analyses revealed that Arpu Kuilpu is an unbrecciated H5 ordinary chondrite, with minimal weathering (W0-1) and minimal shock (S2). The olivine and pyroxene mineral compositions (in mol%) are Fa: 19.2 +- 0.2, and Fs: 16.8 +- 0.2, further supporting the H5 type and class. The measured oxygen isotopes are also consistent with an H chondrite ({\delta}17O = 2.904 +- 0.177; {\delta}18O = 4.163 +- 0.336; {\Delta}17O = 0.740 +- 0.002). Ideal gas pycnometry measured bulk and grain densities of 3.66 +- 0.02 and 3.77 +- 0.02 g cm-3, respectively, yielding a porosity of 3.0 % +- 0.7. The magnetic susceptibility of this meteorite is log X = 5.16 +- 0.08. The most recent impact-related heating event experienced by Arpu Kuilpu was measured by 40Ar/39Ar chronology to be 4467 +- 16 Ma, while the cosmic ray exposure age is estimated to be between 6-8 Ma. The noble gas isotopes, radionuclides, and fireball observations all indicate that Arpu Kuilpu's meteoroid was quite small (maximum radius of 10 cm, though more likely between 1-5 cm). Although this meteorite is a rather ordinary ordinary chondrite, its prior orbit resembled that of a Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) further lending support to the assertion that many cm- to m-sized objects on JFC orbits are asteroidal rather than cometary in origin.</description>

      <title>The Debiased Near-Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly "hiding" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing the NEO population for H $\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population completeness of $\approx$ 88%$^{+3\%}_{-2\%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $\approx$ 36%$^{+1\%}_{-1\%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8% smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding that the $\nu_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence Trends with Galactic Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings employing data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying theoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems of Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly, their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar and planetary properties.</description>

      <title>Mapping the exo-Neptunian landscape. A ridge between the desert and savanna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric and dynamical processes are thought to play a major role in shaping the distribution of close-in exoplanets. A striking feature of such distribution is the Neptunian desert, a dearth of Neptunes on the shortest-period orbits. We aimed to define the boundaries of the Neptunian desert and study its transition into the savanna, a moderately populated region at larger orbital distances. We built a sample of planets and candidates based on the Kepler DR25 catalogue and weighed it according to the transit and detection probabilities. We delimited the Neptunian desert as the close-in region of the period-radius space with no planets at a 3$\sigma$ level, and provide the community with simple, ready-to-use approximate boundaries. We identified an overdensity of planets separating the Neptunian desert from the savanna (3.2 days $ \lessapprox P_{\rm orb}$ $\lessapprox$ 5.7 days) that stands out at a 4.7$\sigma$ level above the desert and at a 3.5$\sigma$ level above the savanna, which we propose to call the Neptunian ridge. The period range of the ridge matches that of the hot Jupiter pileup ($\simeq$3-5 days), which suggests that similar evolutionary processes might act on both populations. We find that the occurrence fraction between the pileup and warm Jupiters is about twice that between the Neptunian ridge and savanna. Our revised landscape supports a previous hypothesis that a fraction of Neptunes were brought to the edge of the desert (i.e. the newly identified ridge) through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HEM) late in their life, surviving the evaporation that eroded Neptunes having arrived earlier in the desert. The ridge thus appears as a true physical feature illustrating the interplay between photoevaporation and HEM, providing further evidence of their role in shaping the distribution of close-in Neptunes.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Spectroastrometry with Photonic Lanterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of photonic lantern (PL) fiber fed spectrometers for two-dimensional spectroastrometry. Spectroastrometry, a technique for studying small angular scales by measuring centroid shifts as a function of wavelength, is typically conducted using long-slit spectrographs. However, slit-based spectroastrometry requires observations with multiple position angles to measure two-dimensional spectroastrometric signals. In a typical configuration of PL-fed spectrometers, light from the focal plane is coupled into the few-moded PL, which is then split into several single-mode outputs, with the relative intensities containing astrometric information. The single-moded beams can be fed into a high-resolution spectrometer to measure wavelength-dependent centroid shifts. We perform numerical simulations of a standard 6-port PL and demonstrate its capability of measuring spectroastrometric signals. The effects of photon noise, wavefront errors, and chromaticity are investigated. When the PL is designed to have large linear responses to tip-tilts at the wavelengths of interest, the centroid shifts can be efficiently measured. Furthermore, we provide mock observations of detecting accreting protoplanets. PL spectroastrometry is potentially a simple and efficient technique for detecting spectroastrometric signals.</description>

      <title>Identifying activity induced RV periodicities and correlations using Central Line Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radial velocity (RV) method of exoplanet detection requires mitigation of nuisance signals arising from stellar activity. Using analytic cool and facular spot models, we explore the use of central line moments (CLMs) for recovering and monitoring rotation induced RV variability. Different spot distribution patterns, photosphere-spot contrast ratios and the presence or absence of the convective blueshift lead to differences in CLM signals between M dwarfs and G dwarfs. Harmonics of the rotation period are often recovered with the highest power in standard periodogram analyses. By contrast, we show the true stellar rotation may be more reliably recovered with string length minimisation. For solar minimum activity levels, recovery of the stellar rotation signal from CLMs is found to require unfeasibly high signal-to-noise observations. The stellar rotation period can be recovered at solar maximum activity levels from CLMs for reasonable cross-correlation function (CCF) signal-to-noise ratios $&gt; 1000 - 5000$. The CLMs can be used to recover and monitor stellar activity through their mutual correlations and correlations with RV and bisector inverse span. The skewness of a CCF, a measure of asymmetry, is described by the third CLM, $M_3$. Our noise-free simulations indicate the linear RV vs $M_3$ correlation is up to 10 per cent higher than the RV vs bisector inverse span correlation. We find a corresponding $\sim 5$ per cent increase in linear correlation for CARMENES observations of the M star, AU Mic. We also assess the effectiveness of the time derivative of the second CLM, $M_2$, for monitoring stellar activity.</description>

      <title>A Model of the C IV $\lambda\lambda$ 1548, 1550 Doublet Line in T Tauri Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The C IV doublet in the UV has long been associated with accretion in T Tauri stars. However, it is still unclear where and how the lines are formed. Here, we present a new C IV line model based on the currently available accretion shock and accretion flow models. We assume axisymmetric, dipolar accretion flows with different energy fluxes and calculate the properties of the accretion shock. We use Cloudy to obtain the carbon level populations and calculate the emerging line profiles assuming a plane-parallel geometry near the shock. Our model generally reproduces the intensities and shapes of the C IV emission lines observed from T Tauri stars. We find that the narrow component is optically thin and originates in the postshock, while the broad component is optically thick and emerges from the preshock. We apply our model to seven T Tauri stars from the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards Director's Discretionary program (ULLYSES), for which consistently determined accretion shock properties are available. We can reproduce the observations of four stars, finding that the accretion flows are carbon-depleted. We also find that the chromospheric emission accounts for less than 10 percent of the observed C IV line flux in accreting T Tauri stars. This work paves the way toward a better understanding of hot line formation and provides a potential probe of abundances in the inner disk.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Torres funerarias chullpa en el valle del r\'io Lauca: un primer an\'alisis arqueoastron\'omico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10497</link>

Abstract: In this work we employ the methods of archaeoastronomy to analyze the orientation, possibly astronomical, of numerous groups of chullpa funerary towers, mainly from the 12th to 16th centuries, located in the Lauca River valley of the central Bolivian highlands. Despite their great historical relevance, both regarding the beliefs and funerary customs of the local populations and the characteristics of the landscape in the highlands, little is known about the relationship of these mortuary monuments with the sky. Several authors, from chroniclers of the colonial era to more modern explorers, indicate that the tomb towers of these regions are oriented in such a way that important parts of their structure (in general, the entrances of the chullpas) point towards the sunrise on the eastern horizon, in order to be imbued with the first rays of the Sun. However, the sunrise changes its location noticeably at different times of the year. Given the lack of written information or other forms of original documentation, in order to affirm the use of a systematic orientation, it is necessary to measure a statistically significant number of monuments. We present here the results of the analysis of the precise spatial orientation of the entrances of 80 towers measured in situ during field work in the Lauca River valley. We find that, except for a few, all the buildings have the openings' axes oriented towards the east and within the solar range, between the extreme azimuths of the annual movement of the Sun as it crosses the local horizon, with a notable concentration of entrances that point slightly towards the north of due east. Our work is the first systematic study of the orientations of the chullpa towers of the Lauca River and can provide crucial information to understand the evolution and scope of the chullpa phenomenon in the Bolivian highlands and in the entire surrounding region.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Small Ultra-short-period Planets Orbiting KG Dwarfs in Kepler Survey Using GPU Phase Folding and Deep Learning Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17382</link>

Abstract: Of over 5,000 exoplanets identified so far, only a few hundred possess sub-Earth radii. The formation processes of these sub-Earths remain elusive, and acquiring additional samples is essential for investigating this unique population. In our study, we employ the GPFC method, a novel GPU Phase Folding algorithm combined with a Convolutional Neural Network, on Kepler photometry data. This method enhances the transit search speed significantly over the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares method, allowing a complete search of the known Kepler KOI data within days using a commercial GPU card. To date, we have identified five new ultra-short-period planets (USPs): Kepler-158d, Kepler-963c, Kepler-879c, Kepler-1489c, and KOI-4978.02. Kepler-879c with a radius of $0.4 R_\oplus$ completes its orbit around a G dwarf in 0.646716 days. Kepler-158d with a radius of $0.43 R_\oplus$ orbits a K dwarf star every 0.645088 days. Kepler-1489c with a radius of $0.51 R_\oplus$ orbits a G dwarf in 0.680741 days. Kepler-963c with a radius of $0.6 R_\oplus$ revolves around a G dwarf in 0.919783 days, and KOI-4978.02 with a radius of $0.7 R_\oplus$ circles a G dwarf in 0.941967 days. Among our findings, Kepler-879c, Kepler-158d and Kepler-963c rank as the first, the third, the fourth smallest USPs identified to date. Notably, Kepler-158d stands as the smallest USP found orbiting K dwarfs while Kepler-963c, Kepler-879c, Kepler-1489c, and KOI-4978.02 are the smallest USPs found orbiting G dwarfs. Kepler-879c, Kepler-158d, Kepler-1489c, and KOI-4978.02 are among the smallest planets that are closest to their host stars, with orbits within 5 stellar radii. In addition, these discoveries highlight GPFC's promising capability in identifying small, new transiting exoplanets within photometry data from Kepler, TESS, and upcoming space transit missions, PLATO and ET.</description>

      <title>TESS discovery of two super-Earths orbiting the M-dwarf stars TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 near the radius valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00709v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the validation of two TESS super-Earth candidates transiting the mid-M dwarfs TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 every 10.90 and 10.44 days, respectively. The first star (TOI-6002) is located $32.038\pm0.019$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2409^{+0.0066}_{-0.0065}$ \rsun, a mass of $0.2105^{+0.0049}_{-0.0048}$ \msun, and an effective temperature of $3229^{+77}_{-57}$ K. The second star (TOI-5713) is located $40.946\pm0.032$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2985^{+0.0073}_{-0.0072}$ \rsun, a mass of $0.2653\pm0.0061$ \msun, and an effective temperature of $3225^{+41}_{-40}$ K. We validated the planets using TESS data, ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from many ground-based facilities, as well as high-resolution AO observations from Keck/NIRC2. TOI-6002 b has a radius of $1.65^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$ \re\ and receives $1.77^{+0.16}_{-0.11} S_\oplus$. TOI-5713 b has a radius of $1.77_{-0.11}^{+0.13} \re$ and receives $2.42\pm{0.11} S_\oplus$. Both planets are located near the radius valley and near the inner edge of the habitable zone of their host stars, which makes them intriguing targets for future studies to understand the formation and evolution of small planets around M-dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>The K2-24 planetary system revisited by CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K2-24 is a planetary system composed of two transiting low-density Neptunians locked in an almost perfect 2:1 resonance and showing large TTVs, i.e., an excellent laboratory to search for signatures of planetary migration. Previous studies performed with K2, Spitzer and RV data tentatively claimed a significant non-zero eccentricity for one or both planets, possibly high enough to challenge the scenario of pure disk migration through resonant capture. With 13 new CHEOPS light curves (seven of planet -b, six of planet -c), we carried out a global photometric and dynamical re-analysis by including all the available literature data as well. We got the most accurate set of planetary parameters to date for the K2-24 system, including radii and masses at 1% and 5% precision (now essentially limited by the uncertainty on stellar parameters) and non-zero eccentricities $e_b=0.0498_{-0.0018}^{+0.0011}$, $e_c=0.0282_{-0.0007}^{+0.0003}$ detected at very high significance for both planets. Such relatively large values imply the need for an additional physical mechanism of eccentricity excitation during or after the migration stage. Also, while the accuracy of the previous TTV model had drifted by up to 0.5 days at the current time, we constrained the orbital solution firmly enough to predict the forthcoming transits for the next ~15 years, thus enabling an efficient follow-up with top-level facilities such as JWST or ESPRESSO.</description>

      <title>Close encounters of the primordial kind: a new observable for primordial black holes as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain a viable dark matter candidate in the asteroid-mass range. We point out that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the inner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high precision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic features. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the abundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.</description>
