      <title>SSI4IoT: Unlocking the Potential of IoT Tailored Self-Sovereign Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) techniques, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), move control of digital identity from conventional identity providers to individuals and lay down the foundation for people, organizations, and things establishing rich digital relationship. The existing applications of SSI mainly focus on creating person-to-person and person-to-service relationships, whereas person-to-device and device-to-device interactions have been largely overlooked. In this paper, we close this gap by identifying a number of key challenges of applying SSI to the Internet of Things (IoT) and providing a comprehensive taxonomy and usage of VCs in the IoT context with respect to their validity period, trust and interoperability level, and scope of usage. The life-cycle management of VCs as well as various optimization techniques for realizing SSI in IoT environments are also addressed in great detail. This work is a noteworthy step towards massive adoption of SSI for securing existing and future IoT applications in practice.</description>

      <title>A scoping review of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to investigate Electronic Health Records (EHRs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) play an important role in the healthcare system. However, their complexity and vast volume pose significant challenges to data interpretation and analysis. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), open up new opportunities for researchers in this domain. Although prior studies have demonstrated their potential in language understanding and processing in the context of EHRs, a comprehensive scoping review is lacking. This study aims to bridge this research gap by conducting a scoping review based on 329 related papers collected from OpenAlex. We first performed a bibliometric analysis to examine paper trends, model applications, and collaboration networks. Next, we manually reviewed and categorized each paper into one of the seven identified topics: named entity recognition, information extraction, text similarity, text summarization, text classification, dialogue system, and diagnosis and prediction. For each topic, we discussed the unique capabilities of LLMs, such as their ability to understand context, capture semantic relations, and generate human-like text. Finally, we highlighted several implications for researchers from the perspectives of data resources, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, performance measures, and ethical concerns. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of LLMs to transform EHR research and discusses their applications and ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>Internet of Paint (IoP): Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for Terahertz Electromagnetic Nanonetworks Embedded in Paint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work opens a new chapter in the 100,000 year-old concept of paint, by leveraging innovations in nano-technology in the sub-THz frequency range. More specifically, the groundbreaking concept of Internet of Paint (IoP) is introduced along with a comprehensive channel model and a capacity analysis for nano-scale radios embedded in paint and communicating through paint. Nano-network devices, integrated within a paint medium, communicate via a multipath strategy, encompassing direct waves, reflections from interfaces, and lateral wave propagation. The evaluation incorporates three distinct paint types to assess path losses, received powers, and channel capacity. Analysis of path loss indicates a slight non-linear increase with both frequency and Line of Sight (LoS) distance between transceivers. Notably, paints with high refractive indexes result in the highest path loss. Moreover, burying transceivers at similar depths near the Air-Paint interface showcases promising performance of lateral waves with increasing LoS distance. Increasing paint layer depth leads to amplified attenuation, while total received power exhibits promising results when in close proximity to the Air-Paint interface but steeply declines with burial depth. Additionally, a substantial reduction in channel capacity is observed with LoS distance and burial depth, so transceivers need to be close together and in proximity of the A-P interface to communicate effectively. Comparing paint and air mediums, IoP demonstrates approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in channel capacity compared to air-based communication channels. This paper provides valuable insights into the potential of IoP communication within paint mediums and offers a foundation for further advancements in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Optimal Toffoli-Depth Quantum Adder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient quantum arithmetic circuits are commonly found in numerous quantum algorithms of practical significance. Till date, the logarithmic-depth quantum adders includes a constant coefficient k &gt;= 2 while achieving the Toffoli-Depth of klog n + O(1). In this work, 160 alternative compositions of the carry-propagation structure are comprehensively explored to determine the optimal depth structure for a quantum adder. By extensively studying these structures, it is shown that an exact Toffoli-Depth of log n + O(1) is achievable. This presents a reduction of Toffoli-Depth by almost 50% compared to the best known quantum adder circuits presented till date. We demonstrate a further possible design by incorporating a different expansion of propagate and generate forms, as well as an extension of the modular framework. Our paper elaborates on these designs, supported by detailed theoretical analyses and simulation-based studies, firmly substantiating our claims of optimality. The results also mirror similar improvements, recently reported in classical adder circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for data-driven classification of rock mass using drilling data: How can a data-driven system handle limitations in existing rock mass classification systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rock mass classification systems are crucial for assessing stability and risk in underground construction globally and guiding support and excavation design. However, systems developed primarily in the 1970s lack access to modern high-resolution data and advanced statistical techniques, limiting their effectiveness as decision-support systems. Initially, we outline the limitations observed in this context and later describe how a data-driven system, based on drilling data as detailed in this study, can overcome these limitations. Using extracted statistical information from thousands of MWD-data values in one-meter sections of a full tunnel profile, thus working as a signature of the rock mass, we have demonstrated that it is possible to form well-defined clusters that can act as a foundational basis for various rock mass classification systems. We reduced the dimensionality of 48-value vectors using nonlinear manifold learning techniques (UMAP) and linear principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance clustering. Unsupervised machine learning methods (HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, K-means) were employed to cluster the data, with hyperparameters optimised through multi-objective Bayesian optimisation for effective clustering. Using domain knowledge, we experienced improved clustering and system tuning opportunities in adding extra features to core clusters of MWD-data. We structured and correlated these clusters with physical rock mass properties, including labels of rock type and rock quality, and analysed cumulative distributions of key MWD-parameters for rock mass assessment to determine if clusters meaningfully differentiate rock masses. The ability of MWD data to form distinct rock mass clusters suggests substantial potential for future classification systems grounded in this objective, data-driven methodology, free from human bias.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Underwater Acoustic Channel Amid Jamming by Random Jammers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater communication networks are increasingly popularized by various important maritime applications. However, this also leads to an increased threat landscape. This letter presents the first study that considers jamming attacks by random jammers present in the surroundings of legitimate transceivers in underwater acoustic communication systems. We investigate the impact of jamming attacks on various performance parameters of the legitimate underwater acoustic communication link. In particular, we investigate the legitimate link using stochastic geometry for important performance parameters, namely coverage probability, average rate, and energy efficiency of the link between two legitimate nodes, i.e., underwater and surface nodes. We then derive and present tractable expressions for these performance parameters. Finally, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to validate our analysis. We plot the performance metrics against the transmit power, and jamming power for different intensities of the jammers in shallow, mid, and deep water scenarios. Results reveal that on average, jamming in deep water has a relatively high impact on the performance of legitimate link than in shallow water.</description>

      <title>QuERLoc: Towards Next-Generation Localization with Quantum-Enhanced Ranging</title>

Abstract: Remarkable advances have been achieved in localization techniques in past decades, rendering it one of the most important technologies indispensable to our daily lives. In this paper, we investigate a novel localization approach for future computing by presenting QuERLoc, the first study on localization using quantum-enhanced ranging. By fine-tuning the evolution of an entangled quantum probe, quantum ranging can output the information integrated in the probe as a specific mapping of distance-related parameters. QuERLoc is inspired by this unique property to measure a special combination of distances between a target sensor and multiple anchors within one single physical measurement. Leveraging this capability, QuERLoc settles two drawbacks of classical localization approaches: (i) the target-anchor distances must be measured individually and sequentially, and (ii) the resulting optimization problems are non-convex and are sensitive to noise. We first present the theoretical formulation of preparing the probing quantum state and controlling its dynamic to induce a convexified localization problem, and then solve it efficiently via optimization. We conduct extensive numerical analysis of QuERLoc under various settings. The results show that QuERLoc consistently outperforms classical approaches in accuracy and closely follows the theoretical lowerbound, while maintaining low time complexity. It achieves a minimum reduction of 73% in RMSE and 97.6% in time consumption compared to baselines. By introducing range-based quantum localization to the mobile computing community and showing its superior performance, QuERLoc sheds light on next-generation localization technologies and opens up new directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Spatially parallel decoding for multi-qubit lattice surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Running quantum algorithms protected by quantum error correction requires a real time, classical decoder. To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits.
  These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</description>
