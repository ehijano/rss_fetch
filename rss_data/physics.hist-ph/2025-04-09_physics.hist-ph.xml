      <title>Spacetime Models for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I revisit Roberto Torretti's "Spacetime Models for the World" [SHPMP 31 (2):171-186 (2000)] in the light of more recent work in (philosophy of) cosmology. I discuss the motivations for FLRW spacetimes as a natural starting point for inquiry, and I suggest contemporary cosmologists can avoid the rationalism that Torretti attributes to Einstein's early work in relativistic cosmology. I then discuss the senses in which FLRW models are idealized, and I show how those idealizations (and partial de-idealizations) have contributed to our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>On (Some) Gauge Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider the sense in which teleparallel gravity and symmetric teleparallel gravity may be understood as gauge theories of gravity. I first argue that both theories have surplus structure. I then consider the relationship between Yang-Mills theory and Poincare Gauge Theory and argue that though these use similar formalisms, there are subtle disanalogies in their interpretation.</description>

      <title>Natural Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the class of physical theories whose dynamics are given by natural equations, which are partial differential equations determined by a functor from the category of n-manifolds, for some n, to the category of fiber bundles, satisfying certain further conditions. We show how the theory of natural equations clarifies several important foundational issues, including the status and meaning of minimal coupling, symmetries of theories, and background structure. We also state and prove a fundamental result about the initial value problem for natural equations.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Stars II: Revisiting Bolometric Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development line of bolometric corrections within the brief history of photometry was described from the perspective of the Kuhnian philosophy of science. The luminous efficiency and heat index were two previous concepts to imply visual and bolometric brightness difference of a star, which was mainly suggested and used as auxiliary tools for calibrating stellar temperature scales before the term ``bolometric correction'' (BC) was also introduced for the same purpose by Kuiper in 1938, as $BC = M_{\rm bol} - M_{\rm V} = m_{\rm {bol}} - V$. Despite its ill-posed nature imposing no zero-point constant ($C_2=0$) for the BC scale and $L_{\rm V} = L \times 10^{BC/2.5}$, if $BC&gt;0$, $L_{\rm V}$ is unphysical, for the luminosity of a star from which ``BC of a star must always be negative,'' ``the bolometric magnitude of a star ought to be brighter than its $V$-magnitude,'' and ``the zero point of bolometric corrections are arbitrary'' (paradigms) were extracted. The newest of the first three definitions of BC was accepted and used throughout the century. Therefore, the part of the development line of BC before Kuiper could be considered a prescience period. The rest could be named the normal science period in which astrophysicists work under the three paradigms. The rise of BC as a concept, how the ill-posed definition BC emerged/used, how inconsistencies (paradigms) of BC developed, and how the Resolution B2 of the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union imposing $C_{\rm bol} = 71.197\,425\,\ldots$ mag, and $C_2&gt;0$, for the zero-point constants of the $M_{\rm {Bol}}$ and BC scales resolve the long-lasting problems were discussed. Generalized new definition of BC implying $L_{\rm V}=L \times 10^\frac{({\rm BC}-C_2)}{2.5}$ were given to replace $L_{\rm V} = L \times 10^{BC/2.5}$.</description>
