      <title>FHECore: Rethinking GPU Microarchitecture for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation directly on encrypted data but incurs massive computational and memory overheads, often exceeding plaintext execution by several orders of magnitude. While custom ASIC accelerators can mitigate these costs, their long time-to-market and the rapid evolution of FHE algorithms threaten their long-term relevance. GPUs, by contrast, offer scalability, programmability, and widespread availability, making them an attractive platform for FHE. However, modern GPUs are increasingly specialized for machine learning workloads, emphasizing low-precision datatypes (e.g., INT$8$, FP$8$) that are fundamentally mismatched to the wide-precision modulo arithmetic required by FHE. Essentially, while GPUs offer ample parallelism, their functional units, like Tensor Cores, are not suited for wide-integer modulo arithmetic required by FHE schemes such as CKKS. Despite this constraint, researchers have attempted to map FHE primitives on Tensor Cores by segmenting wide integers into low-precision (INT$8$) chunks.
  To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose FHECore, a specialized functional unit integrated directly into the GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor. Our design is motivated by a key insight: the two dominant contributors to latency$-$Number Theoretic Transform and Base Conversion$-$can be formulated as modulo-linear transformations. This allows them to be mapped on a common hardware unit that natively supports wide-precision modulo-multiply-accumulate operations. Our simulations demonstrate that FHECore reduces dynamic instruction count by a geometric mean of $2.41\times$ for CKKS primitives and $1.96\times$ for end-to-end workloads. These reductions translate to performance speedups of $1.57\times$ and $2.12\times$, respectively$-$including a $50\%$ reduction in bootstrapping latency$-$all while inuring a modest $2.4\%$ area overhead.</description>

      <title>GRAU: Generic Reconfigurable Activation Unit Design for Neural Network Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous growth of neural network scales, low-precision quantization is widely used in edge accelerators. Classic multi-threshold activation hardware requires 2^n thresholds for n-bit outputs, causing a rapid increase in hardware cost as precision increases. We propose a reconfigurable activation hardware, GRAU, based on piecewise linear fitting, where the segment slopes are approximated by powers of two. Our design requires only basic comparators and 1-bit right shifters, supporting mixed-precision quantization and nonlinear functions such as SiLU. Compared with multi-threshold activators, GRAU reduces LUT consumption by over 90%, achieving higher hardware efficiency, flexibility, and scalability.</description>

      <title>EvolveGen: Algorithmic Level Hardware Model Checking Benchmark Generation through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in hardware model checking depends critically on high-quality benchmarks. However, the community faces a significant benchmark gap: existing suites are limited in number, often distributed only in representations such as BTOR2 without access to the originating register-transfer-level (RTL) designs, and biased toward extreme difficulty where instances are either trivial or intractable. These limitations hinder rigorous evaluation of new verification techniques and encourage overfitting of solver heuristics to a narrow set of problems. To address this, we introduce EvolveGen, a framework for generating hardware model checking benchmarks by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with high-level synthesis (HLS). Our approach operates at an algorithmic level of abstraction in which an RL agent learns to construct computation graphs. By compiling these graphs under different synthesis directives, we produce pairs of functionally equivalent but structurally distinct hardware designs, inducing challenging model checking instances. Solver runtime is used as the reward signal, enabling the agent to autonomously discover and generate small-but-hard instances that expose solver-specific weaknesses. Experiments show that EvolveGen efficiently creates a diverse benchmark set in standard formats (e.g., AIGER and BTOR2) and effectively reveals performance bottlenecks in state-of-the-art model checkers.</description>

      <title>Bitwise Systolic Array Architecture for Runtime-Reconfigurable Multi-precision Quantized Multiplication on Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network accelerators have been widely applied to edge devices for complex tasks like object tracking, image recognition, etc. Previous works have explored the quantization technologies in related lightweight accelerator designs to reduce hardware resource consumption. However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning on Heterogeneous, Edge, and Quantum Hardware for Particle Physics (ML-HEQUPP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of particle physics experiments will face a new era of challenges in data acquisition, due to unprecedented data rates and volumes along with extreme environments and operational constraints. Harnessing this data for scientific discovery demands real-time inference and decision-making, intelligent data reduction, and efficient processing architectures beyond current capabilities. Crucial to the success of this experimental paradigm are several emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and silicon microelectronics, and the advent of quantum algorithms and processing. Their intersection includes areas of research such as low-power and low-latency devices for edge computing, heterogeneous accelerator systems, reconfigurable hardware, novel codesign and synthesis strategies, readout for cryogenic or high-radiation environments, and analog computing. This white paper presents a community-driven vision to identify and prioritize research and development opportunities in hardware-based ML systems and corresponding physics applications, contributing towards a successful transition to the new data frontier of fundamental science.</description>

      <title>ArchAgent: Agentic AI-driven Computer Architecture Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Stream Compaction for Sparse Machine Learning on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are being used more frequently in the first-level triggers in collider experiments, with Graph Neural Networks pushing the hardware requirements of FPGA-based triggers beyond the current state of the art. To meet the stringent demands of high-throughput and low-latency environments, we propose a concept for latency-optimized preprocessing of sparse sensor data, enabling efficient GNN hardware acceleration by removing dynamic input sparsity. Our approach rearranges data coming from a large number of First-In-First-Out interfaces, typically sensor frontends, to a smaller number of FIFO interfaces connected to a machine learning hardware accelerator. In order to achieve high throughput while minimizing the hardware utilization, we developed a hierarchical sparsity compression pipeline optimized for FPGAs. We implemented our concept in the Chisel design language as an open-source hardware generator. For demonstration, we implemented one configuration of our module as preprocessing stage in a GNN-based first-level trigger for the Electromagnetic Calorimeter inside the Belle II detector. Additionally we evaluate latency, throughput, resource utilization, and scalability for a wide range of parameters, to enable broader use for other large scale scientific experiments.</description>
