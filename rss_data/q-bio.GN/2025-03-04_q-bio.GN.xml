      <title>Primer C-VAE: An interpretable deep learning primer design method to detect emerging virus variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: PCR is more economical and quicker than Next Generation Sequencing for detecting target organisms, with primer design being a critical step. In epidemiology with rapidly mutating viruses, designing effective primers is challenging. Traditional methods require substantial manual intervention and struggle to ensure effective primer design across different strains. For organisms with large, similar genomes like Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri, differentiating between species is also difficult but crucial.
  Results: We developed Primer C-VAE, a model based on a Variational Auto-Encoder framework with Convolutional Neural Networks to identify variants and generate specific primers. Using SARS-CoV-2, our model classified variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron) with 98% accuracy and generated variant-specific primers. These primers appeared with &gt;95% frequency in target variants and &lt;5% in others, showing good performance in in-silico PCR tests. For Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, our primer pairs produced fragments &lt;200 bp, suitable for qPCR detection. The model also generated effective primers for organisms with longer gene sequences like E. coli and S. flexneri.
  Conclusion: Primer C-VAE is an interpretable deep learning approach for developing specific primer pairs for target organisms. This flexible, semi-automated and reliable tool works regardless of sequence completeness and length, allowing for qPCR applications and can be applied to organisms with large and highly similar genomes.</description>

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Genomic Surveillance: Approaches, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, wastewater-based genomic surveillance (WWGS) emerged as an efficient viral surveillance tool that takes into account asymptomatic cases and can identify known and novel mutations and offers the opportunity to assign known virus lineages based on the detected mutations profiles. WWGS can also hint towards novel or cryptic lineages, but it is difficult to clearly identify and define novel lineages from wastewater (WW) alone. While WWGS has significant advantages in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 viral spread, technical challenges remain, including poor sequencing coverage and quality due to viral RNA degradation. As a result, the viral RNAs in wastewater have low concentrations and are often fragmented, making sequencing difficult. WWGS analysis requires advanced computational tools that are yet to be developed and benchmarked. The existing bioinformatics tools used to analyze wastewater sequencing data are often based on previously developed methods for quantifying the expression of transcripts or viral diversity. Those methods were not developed for wastewater sequencing data specifically, and are not optimized to address unique challenges associated with wastewater. While specialized tools for analysis of wastewater sequencing data have also been developed recently, it remains to be seen how they will perform given the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the decline in testing and patient-based genomic surveillance. Here, we discuss opportunities and challenges associated with WWGS, including sample preparation, sequencing technology, and bioinformatics methods.</description>

      <title>MLOmics: Benchmark for Machine Learning on Cancer Multi-Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Framing the investigation of diverse cancers as a machine learning problem has recently shown significant potential in multi-omics analysis and cancer research. Empowering these successful machine learning models are the high-quality training datasets with sufficient data volume and adequate preprocessing. However, while there exist several public data portals including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics initiative or open-bases such as the LinkedOmics, these databases are not off-the-shelf for existing machine learning models. In this paper we propose MLOmics, an open cancer multi-omics benchmark aiming at serving better the development and evaluation of bioinformatics and machine learning models. MLOmics contains 8,314 patient samples covering all 32 cancer types with four omics types, stratified features, and extensive baselines. Complementary support for downstream analysis and bio-knowledge linking are also included to support interdisciplinary analysis.</description>

      <title>Penalized Principal Component Analysis Using Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal components computed via PCA (principal component analysis) are traditionally used to reduce dimensionality in genomic data or to correct for population stratification. In this paper, we explore the penalized eigenvalue problem (PEP) which reformulates the computation of the first eigenvector as an optimization problem and adds an $L_1$ penalty constraint to enforce sparseness of the solution. The contribution of our article is threefold. First, we extend PEP by applying smoothing to the original LASSO-type $L_1$ penalty. This allows one to compute analytical gradients which enable faster and more efficient minimization of the objective function associated with the optimization problem. Second, we demonstrate how higher order eigenvectors can be calculated with PEP using established results from singular value decomposition (SVD). Third, we present four experimental studies to demonstrate the usefulness of the smoothed penalized eigenvectors. Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our proposed smoothed PEP allows one to increase numerical stability and obtain meaningful eigenvectors. We also employ the penalized eigenvector approach in two additional real data applications (computation of a polygenic risk score and clustering), demonstrating that exchanging the penalized eigenvectors for their smoothed counterparts can increase prediction accuracy in polygenic risk scores and enhance discernibility of clusterings. Moreover, we compare our proposed smoothed PEP to seven state-of-the-art algorithms for sparse PCA and evaluate the accuracy of the obtained eigenvectors, their support recovery, and their runtime.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal and Multi-Attribute Generation of Single Cells with CFGen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data is crucial for tasks like trajectory inference, batch effect removal, and simulation of realistic cellular data. However, recent deep generative models simulating synthetic single cells from noise operate on pre-processed continuous gene expression approximations, overlooking the discrete nature of single-cell data, which limits their effectiveness and hinders the incorporation of robust noise models. Additionally, aspects like controllable multi-modal and multi-label generation of cellular data remain underexplored. This work introduces CellFlow for Generation (CFGen), a flow-based conditional generative model that preserves the inherent discreteness of single-cell data. CFGen generates whole-genome multi-modal single-cell data reliably, improving the recovery of crucial biological data characteristics while tackling relevant generative tasks such as rare cell type augmentation and batch correction. We also introduce a novel framework for compositional data generation using Flow Matching. By showcasing CFGen on a diverse set of biological datasets and settings, we provide evidence of its value to the fields of computational biology and deep generative models.</description>
