      <title>Lateral shearing optical diffraction tomography of brain organoid with reduced spatial coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is a powerful technique for quantitative, label-free reconstruction of the three-dimensional refractive index (RI) distribution of biological samples. While ODT is well established for imaging thin, weakly scattering samples, it encounters significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous, strongly scattering thick samples such as tissues and organoids. In this work, a novel common-path interferometric approach to ODT is presented, specifically designed for the RI reconstruction of heterogeneous and highly scattering samples at high temporal stability. The proposed technique, termed lateral shearing (LS)-ODT, incorporates partial lateral shearing off-axis interferometry to suppress the effects of multiple scattering, similar to the mechanism in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, which is widely used for imaging thick specimens. Additionally, the LS-ODT system uses dynamic speckle illumination to enhance both spatial phase and RI sensitivity compared to laser-based ODT systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on a cell phantom. Its robustness and accuracy are further validated across a wide range of samples, including mouse kidney tissue sections and brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both thin and thick sections. Furthermore, correlative fluorescence and RI tomography of the organoids highlights the potential of LS-ODT to enhance and support a broad spectrum of biomedical studies, particularly in the field of histology.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of high-Q defect-free optical nanofiber photonic crystal resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of defect-free optical-nanofiber photonic-crystal Fabry-Perot resonators with quality factors exceeding 10^7 using single-shot femtosecond laser ablation. An investigation of the nonlinear optical properties reveals that thermo-optic effects dominate within the entire cavity bandwidth, even when interrogating with pulses one order of magnitude shorter than the 6.6 us thermal cutoff time. The combination of high-Q and small mode volume of these resonators could facilitate the creation of high-speed quantum nodes for cavity QED based quantum computing and networking, as well as low-power in-line fiber optical switches.</description>

      <title>Implications of temporal sampling in voltage imaging microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Voltage imaging microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate neural activity both in vivo and in vitro. Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray Reflection Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and ptychography have become mature tools for high-resolution, element-specific imaging of nanoscale structures. However, transmission geometries impose stringent constraints on sample thickness and preparation, thereby limiting investigations of extended or bulk specimens, especially in the soft X-ray region. Here, we demonstrate reflection geometry soft X-ray ptychography as a robust imaging mode. Instrumental feasibility and spatial resolution are established using a lithographically defined Siemens star and barcode test pattern on a multilayer substrate. We empirically demonstrate a full-pitch spatial resolution of ca. 45 nm from Fourier ring correlation analysis of the reconstructed object. The results highlight the potential of the reflection geometry for nondestructive X-ray studies of materials without the need for transmissive samples.</description>

      <title>Lattice-mismatch Moire laser with strong flatband coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-cell and/or interlayer coupling in Moire superlattices can generate flatbands and collective eigenmodes that enable emergent physical phenomena, motivating extensive exploration of Moire-inspired photonic devices. However, the experimental validation of robust inter-cell interactions in Moire photonic structures and the modulation of flatbands for specific photonic applications remain challenging. Here, we propose a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity and demonstrate nanolasers enabled by strong flatband coupling. In contrast to a twist-angle Moire cavity, a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity provides a stable flatband frequency and a substantial enhancement in Q factor compared to an isolated single-cell cavity, as the unit-cell size decreases. The photonic band-structure measurement of the small-unit-cell Moire cavity by photoluminescence reveals pronounced flatbands. Cell-resolved spectroscopy further confirms the presence of flatbands by identifying resonant peaks that consistently emerge across unit cells in a Moire cavity with a lattice mismatch of 102 nm, but not in a larger-unit-cell Moire cavity with a mismatch of 60 nm. Furthermore, mode selection is achieved by reducing the center-hole size, thus isolating the hexapole mode from the degenerate dipole modes while maintaining strong inter-cell coupling. Consequently, we demonstrate a low-threshold hexapole flatband laser in a single mode. Therefore, the systematic modification of the relative lattice parameters of the two constituent lattices offers a promising strategy for developing Moire nanolasers and flatband nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling X-ray emission with dispersion-engineered surface plasmon polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose controlling the angular and spectral distribution of hard x-ray emission by entangling x-ray photons with ultraviolet surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) whose dispersion is engineered by a metal-dielectric multilayer on a nonlinear crystal. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion of an x-ray pump produces a hard x-ray signal photon correlated with an ultraviolet SPP mode near its resonance. Engineering the SPPs dispersion reshapes the phase-matching landscape and imprints tunable angular-spectral structure on the emitted x-ray photons. The scheme enables compact, designable control of x-ray emission and extends surface-plasmon-assisted nonlinear and quantum x-ray optics.</description>

      <title>Zero-Order Diffraction Suppression in Full Field-of-View Computer Generated Holography: A Camera In the Loop Interferometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel interferometric approach for suppressing zero-order diffraction (ZOD) in phase-only computer-generated holography. The technique relies on the destructive interference between the zeroth-order light and a suppression beam in a plane optically conjugated to the spatial light modulator (SLM). A camera-in-the-loop (CITL) calibration procedure retrieves the optimal pixel-wise phase map that cancels out the ZOD component with high precision, while preserving the full modulation depth of the SLM. Experimental demonstrations on point-cloud and 2D/3D holograms achieve up to 99% suppression of the ZOD intensity, without loss of image quality or field of view. Once calibrated, the correction can be applied to any hologram without recomputation, enabling real-time operation and robust performance over time. This method removes a long-standing barrier to the practical deployment of full-field holography, facilitating the development of compact, high-fidelity holographic engines for augmented and mixed reality displays.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Modulation in Polycrystalline Barium Titanate Metasurfaces Enhanced by Poling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically tunable metasurfaces leveraging the strong Pockel's effect in barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$ or BTO) are a promising platform for reconfigurable free-space optical devices. However, the high cost, limited scalability, and restricted substrate compatibility of epitaxial BTO films hinder its exploitation. Here, we demonstrate free-space optical modulators based on imprinted BTO metasurfaces with targeted designs for optical and electric field confinement within the active material. With resonances exhibiting high quality factors of up to 200, we demonstrate improved transmission modulation at sub-volt driving amplitudes and frequencies up to 5 MHz. Additional enhancement is achieved via ferroelectric domain alignment, resulting in up to 25 % higher modulation strength compared to the unbiased case and up to 75 % compared to previous demonstrations. This enhanced EO response, arising from the effective permittivity engineering and domain orientation in these polycrystalline metasurfaces, holds significant potential for scalable and efficient EO modulators and active metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Temporal Paraxial Optics under Adiabatic Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a temporal paraxial formulation for the propagation of ultrashort optical pulses in time-modulated media with slowly varying refractive index. By deriving the paraxial wave equation directly in the time domain from the Helmholtz equation under an adiabatic approximation, the model remains analytically tractable while extending paraxial optics beyond time-invariant backgrounds commonly treated by frequency-domain expansions. The resulting equation preserves a Schr\"odinger-like structure in the presence of explicit temporal modulation and admits closed-form solutions for ultrashort Gaussian pulses. The framework supports a Green's-function description and an operator-based Hamiltonian formalism, from which an ABCD matrix representation for temporal propagation in time-varying media is obtained. The results demonstrate that temporal modulation provides an active means to control ultrashort pulse dynamics, enabling tailored evolution of pulse characteristics such as temporal width and chirp, with potential applications in ultrafast pulse shaping and a direct connection to temporal wave-packet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Multispectral Mid-Infrared Imaging with Incoherent Light via Adiabatic Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispectral mid-infrared (2-5 ${{\mu}m}$) imaging is a critical capability across science and technology, offering a window into the vibrational and thermal landscape of matter that is inaccessible to visible sensors. It bridges the microscopic world of molecular interactions with macroscopic sensing technologies, with applications in environmental sensing, defense and molecular diagnostics. However, current mid-IR cameras require cryogenic cooling and exhibit limited pixel resolution, high cost, and restricted spectral access. Optical up-conversion provides a pathway to overcome these limitations, but existing systems typically rely on narrowband phase matching, mechanical scanning, or angular tuning, limiting imaging speed and practicality. Here, we demonstrate the first single-shot, room-temperature multispectral mid-IR imaging of incoherent thermal light enabled by adiabatic sum-frequency conversion. Our system simultaneously converts the entire (2-5 ${{\mu}m}$) region into the visible domain, capturing the image on a Silicon detector with spatial resolution below 20 ${{\mu}m}$ and high angular tolerance. We validate full-field imaging using a USAF resolution target and demonstrate spectroscopic contrast imaging in dielectric metamaterials by resolving wavelength and polarization dependent scattering resonances, all achieved without scanning, thermal control, or cryogenic operation. This compact and robust approach bridges the gap between laboratory-grade infrared sensors and scalable Silicon-based detection technologies suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Squeezing Enhanced Photothermal Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-free optical microscopy through absorption or scattering spectroscopy provides fundamental insights across biology and materials science, yet its sensitivity remains fundamentally limited by photon shot noise. While recent demonstrations of quantum nonlinear microscopy show sub-shot-limited sensitivity, they are intrinsically limited by availability of high peak-power squeezed light sources. Here, we introduce squeezing-enhanced photothermal (SEPT) microscopy, a quantum imaging technique that leverages twin-beam quantum correlations to detect absorption induced signals with unprecedented sensitivity. SEPT achieves 3.5 dB noise suppression beyond the standard quantum limit, enabling a 2.5-fold increase in imaging throughput or 31% reduction in pump power, while providing an unmatched versatility through the intrinsic compatibility between continuous-wave squeezing and photothermal modulation. We showcase SEPT applications by providing high-precision characterization of nanoparticles and revealing subcellular structures, such as cytochrome c, that remain undetectable under shot-noise-limited imaging. By combining label-free contrast, quantum-enhanced sensitivity, and compatibility with existing microscopy platforms, SEPT establishes a new paradigm for molecular absorption imaging with far-reaching implications in cellular biology, nanoscience, and materials characterization.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic Tensile Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic (PA) imaging combines the high optical absorption contrast of optical imaging with the deep tissue penetration of ultrasound detection, offering great potential for functional imaging and disease diagnosis. However, current PA imaging methods mainly explore optical absorption properties of biological tissue. To the best of our knowledge, tensile measurement based on PA effect is still an untapped area to be explored. In this work, we propose photoacoustic tensile imaging (PATI), a new PA imaging modality enabling quantitative assessment of tensile stress in biological samples. PATI exploits the nonlinear PA response induced by dual-pulse laser excitation to establish a mapping between the applied tension and the increment of the nonlinear PA signal. By varying the temporal delay between the heating and detecting laser pulses, the relationship between tensile force and nonlinear PA characteristics is quantitatively analyzed. Phantom experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between the nonlinear PA signal intensity and the applied tensile force. These results confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach for tensile force monitoring, which holds potential in biomedical applications, such as vascular pressure monitoring.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave detection via photon-graviton scattering and quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully quantum field-theoretic framework for gravitational wave (GW) detection in which the interaction is described as photon-graviton scattering. In this picture, the GW acts as a coherent background that induces inelastic energy exchanges with the electromagnetic field - analogous to the Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts in Raman spectroscopy. We propose a detection scheme sensitive to this microscopic mechanism based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the scattering-induced phase shifts render frequency-entangled photon pairs distinguishable, spoiling their destructive quantum interference. GW signal is thus encoded in the modulation of photon coincidence rates rather than classical field intensity, offering a complementary quantum probe of the gravitational universe that recovers the standard classical response in the macroscopic limit.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Jump-Diffusion Model for Coherent Optical Control of Quantum Emitters in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional host for stable single-photon emission owing to its wide bandgap, high photostability, and compatibility with nanophotonic integration. We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $\gamma_{\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\mathrm{crit}} \approx 25.91$~K. This hybrid framework provides a quantitative connection between accessible spectroscopic observables and the dominant noise mechanisms limiting coherent optical control in mechanically decoupled quantum emitters, exemplified in hBN and generalizable to similar emitters in other materials.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical framework that couples numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) approach, Molecular Dynamics (MD), and the Two-Temperature Model (TTM) to describe ultrafast laser-matter interactions in metallic systems at the atomic scale. The proposed Maxwell-Two-Temperature Model-Molecular Dynamics (M-TTM-MD) bridges the gap between electromagnetic field propagation, electron-phonon energy exchange, and atomic motion, allowing for a self-consistent treatment of energy absorption, transport, and structural response within a unified simulation environment. The calculated electromagnetic fields incorporate dispersive dielectric properties derived using the Auxiliary Differential Equation (ADE) technique, while the electronic and lattice subsystems are dynamically coupled through spatially and temporally resolved energy exchange terms. The changes in the material topography are then reflected in the updated grid for the FDTD scheme. The developed M-TTM-MD model provides a self-consistent numerical framework that offers insights into laser-induced phenomena in metals, including energy transport and surface dynamics under extreme nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based hologram design for fine optical tweezer arrays and extension of super-resolution criteria</title>

Abstract: Aligning light spots into arbitrary shapes is a fundamental challenge in holography, leading to various applications across diverse fields in science and engineering. However, as the spot interval approaches the wavelength of light, interference effects among the spots become prominent, which complicates the generation of a distortion-free alignment. Herein, we introduce a hologram design method based on the optimisation of a nonlinear cost function using a holographic phase pattern as the optimisation parameter. We confirmed a spot interval of 0.952(1) $\mu$m in a $5 \times 5$ multispot pattern on the focal plane of a high-numerical-aperture (0.75) objective by observing the near-infrared (wavelength: 820 nm) holographic output light from a spatial light modulator device, a result which overcomes the limitation of a few micrometres under similar conditions. Furthermore, the definition of the Rayleigh diffraction limit is refined by considering the separation of spots and the spot interval, thereby concluding the achievement of "super-resolution." The proposed method is expected to advance laser fabrication, scanning laser microscopy, and cold atom physics, among other fields.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature Dipole-Induced Chiral Terahertz Gain and Lasing Threshold in Bulk Tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of Berry curvature dipole in $n$-doped Tellurium as a mechanism for achieving terahertz amplification and lasing by applying a DC electric field. When the electrical bias and wave vector are aligned along the trigonal $c$-axis, the right-handed circularly polarized mode experiences amplification at relatively low bias, while the left-handed mode is attenuated. Furthermore, when the electrical bias and wave vector are orthogonal to the $c$-axis, the structure supports elliptically polarized eigenmodes that also exhibit gain under suitable bias conditions, where the degree of ellipticity is tunable by the applied bias. We also investigate lasing conditions for a Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating biased Te as an active medium. Due to the resonance in the dielectric permittivity of Tellurium, there are discrete lasing intervals. Our results show that bulk chiral Tellurium could be used as an electrically tunable, polarization-selective gain medium for micrometer-scale terahertz lasers, with lasing achievable at bias fields below the material's breakdown threshold, paving the way towards new terahertz devices.</description>

      <title>Laser written waveguides to the sample edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method is presented for fabrication of femtosecond laser written waveguides in glass to remove the need for polishing of substrates after processing. It is shown that by amplitude masking the fabrication laser beam near the sample edge and increasing the pulse energy it is possible to write waveguides that are not affected by edge aberrations and display mode profiles well matched to single mode fiber. Results are presented for different depths in fused silica and borosilicate glass substrates. The transmission from fiber to photonic circuit is significantly improved for situations where it is not possible to polish glass substrates after laser writing, creating new opportunities in photonic packaging.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave detectors from an experimental perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of gravitational wave detectors in a simple and comprehensive manner. Because these instruments aim for extremely high sensitivity, it is essential to understand their various noise sources, how such noise couples to the detector output, and the strategies used to mitigate them. These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated. Although a simplified layout of a gravitational wave detector is considered, it takes into account the most dominant effects and yields in a sensitivity estimate close to the what is observed in real detectors.</description>

      <title>Engineering Spatial Dispersion to Synthesize Arbitrary Spatial Filters Based on Metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a design framework for synthesizing angularly selective spatial filters using non-uniform metagratings. While traditional metagratings focus on channeling energy into higher-order Floquet modes for a fixed incidence angle, we leverage the fundamental mode as a versatile degree of freedom to engineer spatial dispersion over a continuous angular spectrum. By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation.</description>
