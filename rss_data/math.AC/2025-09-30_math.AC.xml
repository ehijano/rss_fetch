      <title>On the Foundations of Approximate Algebra: Axioms, Extensions, and Geometric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the recent works of Inan [4] and Almahareeq-Peters-Vergili [1], we develop a rigorous axiomatic foundation for approximate algebra via an algebra-compatible closure operator $\Phi^{\!*}$ satisfying (C1)-(C4a) together with the balanced multiplicativity axiom (C4b) (and absorption required only for ideals). Our framework encompasses a theory of approximate modules with their isomorphism theorems, the construction of an approximate Zariski topology on the prime spectrum, and a compatible theory of localization. Key results include a $\mathrm{T}_0$ property and a $\mathrm{T}_1$-criterion for the spectrum, an extension--contraction bijection for approximate prime ideals in localizations, and the equality of the approximate prime radical and the nilradical. The theory's utility is illustrated by computing $\mathrm{Spec}_{\!\Phi}(\mathbb{Z})$ for the modular closure $\Phi^{\!*}(A)=\langle A\rangle+m\mathbb{Z}$, which yields a finite discrete space -- in stark contrast to the classical $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, which is infinite and not even $\mathrm{T}_1$. We also outline a pathway toward an Approximate Nullstellensatz and record model classes of closures that ensure its evaluation--separation hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Involutive Brauer groups and Poincar\'e rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the formalism of Poincar\'e $ \infty $-categories, as developed by Calm\`es-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle, to define and study moduli stacks of line bundles with $ \lambda $-hermitian pairings and of Morita equivalence classes of Azumaya algebras equipped with an involution. Our moduli spaces give rise to enhancements of the ordinary Picard and Brauer groups which incorporate the data of an involution on the base; we will refer to these new invariants as the Poincar\'e Picard group and the Poincar\'e Brauer group. We show that we can recover the involutive Brauer group of Parimala-Srinivas from the Poincar\'e Brauer group when the former is defined; however, they no longer agree even for closed points due to the existence of shifted perfect pairings. A natural context for Poincar\'e Picard and Poincar\'e Brauer groups is a category of highly structured ring spectra which we refer to as Poincar\'e rings. We also compute these invariants for the sphere spectrum and other examples. As a consequence, we deduce a derived enhancement of a classical theorem of Saltman.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebra neural network reveals genetic origins of diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic mutations can disrupt protein structure, stability, and solubility, contributing to a wide range of diseases. Existing predictive models often lack interpretability and fail to integrate physical and chemical interactions critical to molecular mechanisms. Moreover, current approaches treat disease association, stability changes, and solubility alterations as separate tasks, limiting model generalizability. In this study, we introduce a unified framework based on multiscale commutative algebra to capture intrinsic physical and chemical interactions for the first time. Leveraging Persistent Stanley-Reisner Theory, we extract multiscale algebraic invariants to build a Commutative Algebra neural Network (CANet). Integrated with transformer features and auxiliary physical features, we apply CANet to tackle three key domains for the first time: disease-associated mutations, mutation-induced protein stability changes, and solubility changes upon mutations. Across six benchmark tasks, CANet and its gradient boosting tree counterpart, CATree, consistently attain state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in predictive accuracy. Our approach offers multiscale, mechanistic, interpretable,and generalizable models for predicting disease-mutation associations.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Solutions to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables \emph{analytical} construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGS (\emph{\underline{Co}mposing \underline{G}lobal \underline{S}olutions}). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of \emph{sum potentials}, which are ring homomorphisms, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global solutions constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that overparameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global solutions such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.
