      <title>Minimum Congestion Routing of Unsplittable Flows in Data-Center Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of flows are routed concurrently through a modern data-center. These networks are often built as Clos topologies, and flow demands are constrained only by the link capacities at the ingress and egress points. The minimum congestion routing problem seeks to route a set of flows through a data center while minimizing the maximum flow demand on any link. This is easily achieved by splitting flow demands along all available paths. However, arbitrary flow splitting is unrealistic. Instead, network operators rely on heuristics for routing unsplittable flows, the best of which results in a worst-case congestion of $2$ (twice the uniform link capacities). But is $2$ the lowest possible congestion? If not, can an efficient routing algorithm attain congestion below $2$?
  Guided by these questions, we investigate the minimum congestion routing problem in Clos networks with unsplittable flows. First, we show that for some sets of flows the minimum congestion is at least $\nicefrac{3}{2}$, and that it is $NP$-hard to approximate a minimum congestion routing by a factor less than $\nicefrac{3}{2}$. Second, addressing the motivating questions directly, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees a congestion of at most $\nicefrac{9}{5}$ for any set of flows, while also providing a $\nicefrac{9}{5}$ approximation of a minimum congestion routing. Last, shifting to the online setting, we demonstrate that no online algorithm (even randomized) can approximate a minimum congestion routing by a factor less than $2$, providing a strict separation between the online and the offline setting.</description>

      <title>Shadow Wireless Intelligence: Large Language Model-Driven Reasoning in Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert Communications (CC) can secure sensitive transmissions in industrial, military, and mission-critical applications within 6G wireless networks. However, traditional optimization methods based on Artificial Noise (AN), power control, and channel manipulation might not adapt to dynamic and adversarial environments due to the high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and stringent real-time covertness requirements. To bridge this gap, we introduce Shadow Wireless Intelligence (SWI), which integrates the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to enable intelligent decision-making in covert wireless systems. Specifically, we utilize DeepSeek-R1, a mixture-of-experts-based LLM with RL-enhanced reasoning, combined with real-time retrieval of domain-specific knowledge to improve context accuracy and mitigate hallucinations. Our approach develops a structured CC knowledge base, supports context-aware retrieval, and performs semantic optimization, allowing LLMs to generate and adapt CC strategies in real time. In a case study on optimizing AN power in a full-duplex CC scenario, DeepSeek-R1 achieves 85% symbolic derivation accuracy and 94% correctness in the generation of simulation code, outperforming baseline models. These results validate SWI as a robust, interpretable, and adaptive foundation for LLM-driven intelligent covert wireless systems in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Satellite-Assisted Low-Altitude Economy Networking: Concepts, Applications, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is a new economic paradigm that leverages low-altitude vehicles (LAVs) to perform diverse missions across diverse areas. To support the operations of LAE, it is essential to establish LAE networks that enable LAV management and communications.Existing studies mainly reuse terrestrial networks to construct LAE networks. However, the limited coverage of terrestrial networks poses challenges for serving LAVs in remote areas. Besides, efficient LAV operations also require support such as localization and navigation, which terrestrial networks designed for communications cannot fully provide. Due to ubiquitous coverage and diverse functions, satellites are a promising technology to support LAVs. Therefore, this article investigates satellite-assisted LAE networking. First, we introduce an overview of LAE and satellites, discussing their features, applications, and architectures. Next, we investigate opportunities for satellites to assist LAE from aspects of communication, control, and computation. As all assistance depends on reliable satellite-LAV communications, we propose a satellite-assisted LAE framework to tackle issues caused by the severe path loss and high dynamics in satellite-assisted LAE networks.The case study demonstrates that the distributed MIMO architecture efficiently reduces the required transmission power and extends service duration, while the two-timescale optimization scheme balances the performance and control signaling overheads. Specifically, the proposed framework comprises distributed satellite MIMO, distributed LAV MIMO, and a two-timescale optimization scheme.</description>

      <title>Joint Task Offloading and Channel Allocation in Spatial-Temporal Dynamic for MEC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation offloading and resource allocation are critical in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems to handle the massive and complex requirements of applications restricted by limited resources. In a multi-user multi-server MEC network, the mobility of terminals causes computing requests to be dynamically distributed in space. At the same time, the non-negligible dependencies among tasks in some specific applications impose temporal correlation constraints on the solution as well, leading the time-adjacent tasks to experience varying resource availability and competition from parallel counterparts. To address such dynamic spatial-temporal characteristics as a challenge in the allocation of communication and computation resources, we formulate a long-term delay-energy trade-off cost minimization problem in the view of jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. We begin by designing a priority evaluation scheme to decouple task dependencies and then develop a grouped Knapsack problem for channel allocation considering the current data load and channel status. Afterward, in order to meet the rapid response needs of MEC systems, we exploit the double duel deep Q network (D3QN) to make offloading decisions and integrate channel allocation results into the reward as part of the dynamic environment feedback in D3QN, constituting the joint optimization of task offloading and channel allocation. Finally, comprehensive simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the delay-energy trade-off cost and its adaptability for various applications.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of an NDN-Based Network for Distributed Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins (DT) have received significant attention due to their numerous benefits, such as real-time data analytics and cost reduction in production. DT serves as a fundamental component of many applications, encompassing smart manufacturing, intelligent vehicles, and smart cities. By using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, DTs can efficiently facilitate decision-making and productivity by simulating the status and changes of a physical entity. To handle the massive amount of data brought by DTs, it is challenging to achieve low response latency for data fetching over existing IP-based networks. IP-based networks use host addresses for end-to-end communication, making data distribution between DTs inefficient. Thus, we propose to use DTs in a distributed manner over Named Data Networking (NDN) networks. NDN is data-centric where data is routed based on content names, dynamically adjusting paths to optimize latency. Popular data is cached in network nodes, reducing data transmission and network congestion. Since data is fetched by content names, users and mobile devices can move freely without IP address reassignment. By using in-network caching and adaptive routing, we reckon NDN is an ideal fit for Future G Networks in the context of Digital Twins. We compared DTs in edge scenarios with cloud scenarios over NDN and IP-based networks to validate our insights. Extensive simulation results show that using DT in the edge reduces response latency by 10.2x. This position paper represents an initial investigation into the gap in distributed DTs over NDN, serving as an early-stage study.</description>

      <title>Pipelining Split Learning in Multi-hop Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support large-scale model training, split learning (SL) enables multiple edge devices/servers to share the intensive training workload. However, most existing works on SL focus solely on two-tier model splitting. Moreover, while some recent works have investigated the model splitting and placement problems for multi-hop SL, these solutions fail to overcome the resource idleness issue, resulting in significant network idle time. In this work, we propose a pipelined SL scheme by addressing the joint optimization problem of model splitting and placement (MSP) in multi-hop edge networks. By applying pipeline parallelism to SL, we identify that the MSP problem can be mapped to a problem of minimizing the weighted sum of a bottleneck cost function (min-max) and a linear cost function (min-sum). Based on graph theory, we devise a bottleneck-aware shortest-path algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Besides, given the MSP outcomes, we also derive the closed-form solution to the micro-batch size in the pipeline. Finally, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm of MSP and micro-batch size to solve the joint optimization problem to minimize the end-to-end training latency. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the significant advantages of our algorithm compared to existing benchmarks without pipeline parallelism.</description>

      <title>LLMs' Suitability for Network Security: A Case Study of STRIDE Threat Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be an integral part of next-generation AI-native 6G networks. With the prevalence of AI, researchers have identified numerous use cases of AI in network security. However, there are almost nonexistent studies that analyze the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in network security. To fill this gap, we examine the suitability of LLMs in network security, particularly with the case study of STRIDE threat modeling. We utilize four prompting techniques with five LLMs to perform STRIDE classification of 5G threats. From our evaluation results, we point out key findings and detailed insights along with the explanation of the possible underlying factors influencing the behavior of LLMs in the modeling of certain threats. The numerical results and the insights support the necessity for adjusting and fine-tuning LLMs for network security use cases.</description>

      <title>On-Device LLM for Context-Aware Wi-Fi Roaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless roaming is a critical yet challenging task for maintaining seamless connectivity in dynamic mobile environments. Conventional threshold-based or heuristic schemes often fail, leading to either sticky or excessive handovers. We introduce the first cross-layer use of an on-device large language model (LLM): high-level reasoning in the application layer that issues real-time actions executed in the PHY/MAC stack. The LLM addresses two tasks: (i) context-aware AP selection, where structured prompts fuse environmental cues (e.g., location, time) to choose the best BSSID; and (ii) dynamic threshold adjustment, where the model adaptively decides when to roam. To satisfy the tight latency and resource budgets of edge hardware, we apply a suite of optimizations-chain-of-thought prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and quantization. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that our approach surpasses legacy heuristics and DRL baselines, achieving a strong balance between roaming stability and signal quality. These findings underscore the promise of application-layer LLM reasoning for lower-layer wireless control in future edge systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart cities transform urban landscapes with interconnected nodes and sensors. The search for seamless communication in time-critical scenarios has become evident during this evolution. With the escalating complexity of urban environments, envisioning a future with a blend of autonomous and conventional systems, each demanding distinct quality-of-service considerations, services in smart cities vary in criticality levels and necessitate differentiated traffic handling, prioritizing critical flows without compromising the network's reliability or failing on hard real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we discuss a time-sensitive networking approach, which presents multi-faceted challenges, notably interoperability among diverse technologies and standards at the scale of a smart city network. TSN emerges as a promising toolkit, encompassing synchronization, latency management, redundancy, and configuration functionalities crucial for addressing smart city challenges. Moreover, the article scrutinizes how TSN, predominantly utilized in domains like automotive and industry, can be tailored to suit the intricate needs of smart cities, emphasizing the necessity for adaptability and scalability in network design. This survey consolidates current research on TSN, outlining its potential in fortifying critical machine-to-machine communications within smart cities while highlighting future challenges, potential solutions, and a roadmap for integrating TSN effectively into the fabric of urban connectivity.</description>

      <title>InfiniteHBD: Building Datacenter-Scale High-Bandwidth Domain for LLM with Optical Circuit Switching Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).
  We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</description>

Abstract: Providing timely and informative data in integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks is critical as data volume grows while the resources available on devices remain limited. To address this, we adopt a semantics-aware approach to optimize the Version Age of Information (VAoI) in a status update system in which a remote Energy Harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) device samples data and transmits it to a network of interconnected Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for dissemination and utilization. The optimal update policy is derived through stochastic modeling and optimization of the VAoI across the network. The results indicate that this policy reduces the frequency of updates by skipping stale or irrelevant data, significantly improving energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Scheduling over Wi-Fi 6 using Target Wake Time: An Experimental Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wi-Fi networks traditionally use Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) that employs CSMA/CA along with the binary backoff mechanism for channel access. This causes unavoidable contention overheads and does not provide performance guarantees. In this work, we outline some issues that occur with the probabilistic channel access in highly congested scenarios and how those can be mitigated using deterministic scheduling. Towards this, we propose to use Target Wake Time (TWT) - a feature introduced in Wi-Fi 6 as a power-saving mechanism, to improve the performance of Wi-Fi. To gain insights into the workings of the TWT over commercially available off-the-shelf components and to analyze the factors that affect its performance, we carry out various experiments with it over our Wi-Fi 6 testbed. Using these insights and analysis, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to synthesize deterministic schedules and obtain the optimal values of various system parameters. Lastly, we configure our testbed with these optimal parameter values and show that the TWT based deterministic scheduling consistently results in better performance of the TWT-capable clients and overall system performance compared to traditional CSMA/CA based scheduling.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Fractional Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-Minimal Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16832v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of emerging real-time networked applications like cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Age of Information (AoI) has merged as a pivotal metric for evaluating the timeliness. To meet the high computational demands, such as those in intelligent manufacturing within CPS, mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising solution for optimizing computing and reducing AoI. In this work, we study the timeliness of computational-intensive updates and explores jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies to minimize AoI. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The fractional objective introduced by AoI and the semi-Markov game nature of the problem render this challenge particularly difficult, with existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework to fractional reinforcement learning (RL). We first introduce a fractional single-agent RL framework and prove its linear convergence. We then extend this to a fractional multi-agent RL framework with a convergence analysis. To tackle the challenge of asynchronous control in semi-Markov game, we further design an asynchronous model-free fractional multi-agent RL algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 52.6% compared with the best baseline algorithm in our experiments.</description>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed optimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally trained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.</description>
