      <title>AdapCsiNet: Environment-Adaptive CSI Feedback via Scene Graph-Aided Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for realizing the full potential of multiple-antenna wireless communication systems. While deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback methods have shown promise in reducing feedback overhead, their generalization capability across varying propagation environments remains limited due to their data-driven nature. Existing solutions based on online training improve adaptability but impose significant overhead in terms of data collection and computational resources. In this work, we propose AdapCsiNet, an environment-adaptive DL-based CSI feedback framework that eliminates the need for online training. By integrating environmental information -- represented as a scene graph -- into a hypernetwork-guided CSI reconstruction process, AdapCsiNet dynamically adapts to diverse channel conditions. A two-step training strategy is introduced to ensure baseline reconstruction performance and effective environment-aware adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate that AdapCsiNet achieves up to 46.4% improvement in CSI reconstruction accuracy and matches the performance of online learning methods without incurring additional runtime overhead.</description>

      <title>Radiation Footprint Control in Cell-Free Cooperative ISAC: Optimal Joint BS Activation and Beamforming Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated beamforming across distributed base stations (BSs) in cell-free architectures can efficiently support integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) users by improving resource sharing and reducing conflicts in the spatial domain. However, coordinating numerous BSs within the ISAC network poses risks of generating substantial interference for other networks sharing the spectrum, while also increasing operational costs from power consumption and signaling overhead. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interference-suppressed and cost-optimized cell-free ISAC network by opportunistically and cooperatively orchestrating distributed radio resources to address competing sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) demands. Specifically, we conceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that autonomously suppresses interference across the entire signal propagation space to safeguard other networks without exchanging signaling. Then, we propose joint BS activation and beamforming coordination to dynamically activate appropriate BSs and orchestrate their spatial beams for service provisioning. Building upon this framework, we formulate a cost-efficient utility maximization problem that considers individual S\&amp;C demands and location-dependent radiation footprint constraints. Since this results in a non-convex optimization problem, we develop a monotonic optimization embedded branch-and-bound (MO-BRB) algorithm to find the optimal solution. Additionally, we apply a low-complexity iterative method to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a new type of multicarrier (MC) scheme built upon the recently discovered delay-Doppler domain orthogonal pulse (DDOP), orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) aims to address the challenges of waveform design in linear time-varying channels. In this paper, we explore the design principles of ODDM and clarify the key ideas underlying the DDOP. We then derive an alternative representation of the DDOP and highlight the fundamental differences between ODDM and conventional MC schemes. Finally, we discuss and compare two implementation methods for ODDM.</description>

      <title>New Constructions of Binary Cyclic Codes with Both Relatively Large Minimum Distance and Dual Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary cyclic codes are worth studying due to their applications and theoretical importance. It is an important problem to construct an infinite family of cyclic codes with large minimum distance $d$ and dual distance $d^{\perp}$. In recent years, much research has been devoted to improving the lower bound on $d$, some of which have exceeded the square-root bound. The constructions presented recently seem to indicate that when the minimum distance increases, the minimum distance of its dual code decreases. In this paper, we focus on the new constructions of binary cyclic codes with length $n=2^m-1$, dimension near $n/2$, and both relatively large minimum distance and dual distance. For $m$ is even, we construct a family of binary cyclic codes with parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1}\pm1,d]$, where $d\ge 2^{m/2}-1$ and $d^\perp\ge2^{m/2}$. Both the minimum distance and the dual distance are significantly better than the previous results. When $m$ is the product of two distinct primes, we construct some cyclic codes with dimensions $k=(n+1)/2$ and $d&gt;\frac{n}{\log_2n},$ where the lower bound on the minimum distance is much larger than the square-root bound. For $m$ is odd, we present two families of binary $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},d]$ cyclic codes with $d\ge2^{(m+1)/2}-1$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m+1)/2}$ and $d\ge2^{(m+3)/2}-15$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m-1)/2}$ respectively, which leads that $d\cdot d^\perp$ can reach $2n$ asymptotically. To the best of our knowledge, except for the punctured binary Reed-Muller codes, there is no other construction of binary cyclic codes that reaches this bound.</description>

      <title>Helper-Friendly Latency-Bounded Mitigation Strategies against Reactive Jamming Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the recent developments in the field of full-duplex radios and cognitive radios, a new class of reactive jamming attacks has gained attention wherein an adversary transmits jamming energy over the victim's frequency band and also monitors various energy statistics in the network so as to detect countermeasures, thereby trapping the victim. Although cooperative mitigation strategies against such security threats exist, they are known to incur spectral-efficiency loss on the helper node, and are also not robust to variable latency-constraints on victim's messages. Identifying these research gaps in existing countermeasures against reactive jamming attacks, we propose a family of helper-friendly cooperative mitigation strategies that are applicable for a wide-range of latency-requirements on the victim's messages as well as practical radio hardware at the helper nodes. The proposed strategies are designed to facilitate reliable communication for the victim, without compromising the helper's spectral efficiency and also minimally disturbing the various energy statistics in the network. For theoretical guarantees on their efficacy, interesting optimization problems are formulated on the choice of the underlying parameters, followed by extensive mathematical analyses on their error-performance and covertness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategies should be preferred over the state-of-the-art methods when the helper node is unwilling to compromise on its error performance for assisting the victim.</description>

      <title>Easy repair via codes with simplex locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of distributed storage systems, locally repairable codes have become important. In this paper we focus on codes that allow for multi-erasure pattern decoding with low computational effort. Different optimality requirements, measured by the code's rate, minimum distance, locality, availability as well as field size, influence each other and can not all be maximized at the same time. We focus on the notion of easy repair, more specifically on the construction of codes that can repair correctable erasure patterns with minimal computational effort. In particular, we introduce the easy repair property and then present codes of different rates that possess this property. The presented codes are all in some way related to simplex codes and comprise block codes as well as unit-memory convolutional codes. We also formulate conditions under which the easy repairs can be performed in parallel, thus improving access speed of the distributed storage system.</description>

      <title>Property Inheritance for Subtensors in Tensor Train Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor dimensionality reduction is one of the fundamental tools for modern data science. To address the high computational overhead, fiber-wise sampled subtensors that preserve the original tensor rank are often used in designing efficient and scalable tensor dimensionality reduction. However, the theory of property inheritance for subtensors is still underdevelopment, that is, how the essential properties of the original tensor will be passed to its subtensors. This paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor properties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train setting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise sampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated under various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be well preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling. Overall, this paper provides several handy analytic tools for developing efficient tensor analysis</description>

      <title>Breaking the TDD Flow for Over-the-Air Phase Synchronization in Distributed Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase synchronization between distributed antenna arrays requires measurements that break the standard time-division duplex (TDD) operation. We present a feasibility study on implementing such synchronization and analyze its impact on the quality of service. Considering two antenna arrays with independent local oscillators (LOs), we propose a modified TDD flow to accommodate the transmission of phase synchronization signals, formulate the phase estimation and compensation problem, and derive the achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that frequent re-estimation of the interarray phase disparity is essential for maximizing SE in systems with low-quality LOs. Furthermore, applying a Kalman filter for phase tracking substantially improves the SE, especially if phase estimation errors are large compared to LOs phase drifts.</description>

      <title>Full-Diversity Construction-D Lattices: Design and Decoding Perspective on Block-Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing algebraic lattices based on Construction-D, leveraging nested linear codes and prime ideals from algebraic number fields. We focus on the application of these lattices in block-fading (BF) channels, which are characterized by piecewise-constant fading across blocks of transmitted symbols. This approach results in a semi-systematic generator matrix, providing a structured foundation for high-dimensional lattice design for BF channels. The proposed Construction-D lattices exhibit the full diversity property, making them highly effective for error performance improvement. To address this, we develop an efficient decoding algorithm designed specifically for full-diversity Construction-D lattices.
  Simulations indicate that the proposed lattices notably enhance error performance compared to full-diversity Construction-A lattices in diversity-2 cases. Interestingly, unlike AWGN channels, the expected performance enhancement of Construction-D over Construction-A, resulting from an increased number of nested code levels, was observed only in the two-level and diversity-2 cases. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the intensified effects of error propagation that occur during successive cancellation at higher levels, as well as the higher diversity orders.
  These findings highlight the promise of Construction-D lattices as an effective coding strategy for enhancing communication reliability in BF channels.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Channel Estimation Framework for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) refers to a family of RIS architectures characterized by scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal and enables higher wave manipulation flexibility and large performance gains over conventional (diagonal) RIS. To achieve those promising gains, accurate channel state information (CSI) needs to be acquired in BD-RIS assisted communication systems. However, the number of coefficients in the cascaded channels to be estimated in BD-RIS assisted systems is significantly larger than that in conventional RIS assisted systems, because the channels associated with the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix have to be estimated as well. Surprisingly, for the first time in the literature, this paper rigorously shows that the uplink channel estimation overhead in BD-RIS assisted systems is actually of the same order as that in the conventional RIS assisted systems. This amazing result stems from a key observation: for each user antenna, its cascaded channel matrix associated with one reference BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-base station (BS) channel. In other words, the number of independent unknown variables is far less than it would seem at first glance. Building upon this property, this paper manages to characterize the minimum overhead to perfectly estimate all the channels in the ideal case without noise at the BS, and propose a twophase estimation framework for the practical case with noise at the BS. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding channel estimation overhead reduction over existing schemes in BD-RIS assisted systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Transceiver Design for Multi-User Communication in FDD Massive MIMO Systems via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint transceiver design, including pilot transmission, channel feature extraction and feedback, as well as precoding, for low-overhead downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication in frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems. Although deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in tackling this problem, existing methods often suffer from poor scalability in practical systems, as the solution obtained in the training phase merely works for a fixed feedback capacity and a fixed number of users in the deployment phase. To address this limitation, we propose a novel DL-based framework comprised of choreographed neural networks, which can utilize one training phase to generate all the transceiver solutions used in the deployment phase with varying sizes of feedback codebooks and numbers of users. The proposed framework includes a residual vector-quantized variational autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) for efficient channel feedback and an edge graph attention network (EGAT) for robust multiuser precoding. It can adapt to different feedback capacities by flexibly adjusting the RVQ codebook sizes using the hierarchical codebook structure, and scale with the number of users through a feedback module sharing scheme and the inherent scalability of EGAT. Moreover, a progressive training strategy is proposed to further enhance data transmission performance and generalization capability. Numerical results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superior scalability and performance of our approach over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework of Semantic Communication based on Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While semantic communication (SemCom) has recently demonstrated great potential to enhance transmission efficiency and reliability by leveraging machine learning (ML) and knowledge base (KB), there is a lack of mathematical modeling to rigorously characterize SemCom system and quantify the performance gain obtained from ML and KB. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for SemCom based on category theory, rigorously model the concepts of semantic entities and semantic probability space. Within this framework, semantic entropy is introduced to quantify the uncertainty of semantic entities. We theoretically prove that semantic entropy can be effectively reduced by exploiting KB, which capture semantic dependencies. Specifically, semantic entities can be combined based on semantic ambiguity, and are encoded based on contextual relationships among them. Then we refine semantic channel capacity modeling, which considers the mutual information contained in KB to better reflect SemCom efficiency. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing that SemCom with KB integration outperforms traditional communication in both entropy reduction and coding efficiency.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A prediction makes a claim about a system's future given knowledge of its past. A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its future. We introduce the ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally -- the bidirectional machine whose state structure makes explicit all statistical correlations in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurements, in addition to being limited to single measurements the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming these via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to information embedded across sequential measurements. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable information measures that fully characterize a process' informational structure. Additionally, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of highly complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Quantum Simulation via Symplectic Transvections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing realize logical circuits gate-by-gate, synthesizing each gate independently on one or more code blocks. This incurs excess overhead and doesn't leverage common structures in quantum algorithms. In contrast, we propose a framework that enables the execution of entire logical circuit blocks at once, preserving their global structure. This whole-block approach allows for the direct implementation of logical Trotter circuits - of arbitrary rotation angles - on any stabilizer code, providing a powerful new method for fault tolerant Hamiltonian simulation within a single code block. At the heart of our approach lies a deep structural correspondence between symplectic transvections and Trotter circuits. This connection enables both logical and physical circuits to share the Trotter structure while preserving stabilizer centralization and circuit symmetry even in the presence of non-Clifford rotations. We discuss potential approaches to fault tolerance via biased noise and code concatenation. While we illustrate the key principles using a $[[8,3,3]]$ code, our simulations show that the framework applies to Hamiltonian simulation on even good quantum LDPC codes. These results open the door to new algorithm-tailored, block-level strategies for fault tolerant circuit design, especially in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>On the performance of downlink NOMA in underlay spectrum sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and spectrum sharing are two potential technologies for providing massive connectivity in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks. In this paper, we present the performance analysis of a multi-antenna-assisted two-user downlink NOMA system in an underlay spectrum sharing system. We derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable sum-rate and outage probability of the secondary network under a peak interference constraint and/or peak power constraint, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) of the interference link between secondary transmitter (ST) and primary receiver (PR). For the case where the ST has a fixed power budget, we show that performance can be divided into two specific regimes, where either the interference constraint or the power constraint primarily dictates the performance. Our results confirm that the NOMA-based underlay spectrum sharing system significantly outperforms its orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based counterpart, by achieving higher average sum-rate and lower outage probability. We also show the effect of information loss at the ST in terms of CSI of the link between the ST and PR on the system performance. Moreover, we also present closed-form expressions for the optimal power allocation coefficient that minimizes the outage probability of the NOMA system for the special case where the secondary users are each equipped with a single antenna. A close agreement between the simulation and analytical results confirms the correctness of the presented analysis.</description>

      <title>Differential Properties of Information in Jump-diffusion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05708v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a channel modeling using jump-diffusion processes, and study the differential properties of entropy and mutual information. By utilizing the Kramers-Moyal and Kolmogorov-Feller equations, we express the mutual information between the input and the output in series and integral forms, presented by Fisher-type information and mismatched KL divergence. We extend de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation to encompass general Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Information Age and Correctness for Energy Harvesting Devices with Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate accuracy and freshness of status updates from a large number of energy-harvesting devices that monitor two-state Markov processes and access the medium using the slotted ALOHA protocol without feedback. Using a Markovian framework, we analyze the average value of a generic state-dependent penalty function that grows whenever there is a state estimation error. The age of incorrect information (AoII) is an example of such penalty function. We propose an accurate and easy-to-compute approximation for the average penalty. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of optimizing the transmission probabilities according to the process state transitions and current battery levels to minimize the average penalty. The average-AoII-minimizing strategy can be highly suboptimal in terms of average penalty when one of the process states is critical, i.e., entails a high penalty if wrongly estimated. Furthermore, minimizing the average penalty does not guarantee a low probability of misdetecting a critical state period.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Diagnosis of Defective Elements in Intelligent Reflecting Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to circuit failures, defective elements that cannot adaptively adjust the phase shifts of their impinging signals in a desired manner may exist on an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Traditional way to locate these defective IRS elements requires a thorough diagnosis of all the circuits belonging to a huge number of IRS elements, which is practically challenging. In this paper, we will devise novel approaches under which a transmitter sends known pilot signals and a receiver localizes all the defective IRS elements just based on its over-the-air measurements reflected from the IRS. Specifically, given any set of IRS elements, we propose an efficient method to process the received signals to determine whether this cluster contains defective elements or not with a very high accuracy probability. Based on this method, we show that the over-the-air diagnosis problem belongs to the 20 questions problem, where we can adaptively change the query set at the IRS so as to localize all the defective elements as quickly as possible. Along this line, we first propose a sorted posterior matching (sortPM) based method according to the noisy 20 questions technique, which enables accurate diagnosis even if the answers about the existence of defective elements in some sets of interest are wrong at certain question and answer (Q&amp;A) rounds due to the noisy received signals. Next, to reduce the complexity, we propose a bisection based method according to the noiseless 20 questions technique, which totally trusts the answer at each Q&amp;A round and keeps removing half of the remaining region based on such answers. Via numerical results, we show that our proposed methods can exploit the over-the-air measurements to localize all the defective IRS elements quickly and accurately.</description>

      <title>Fully smooth one shot multipartite soft covering of quantum states without pairwise independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a powerful machinery to prove fully smooth one shot multipartite covering, aka convex split, type results for quantum states. In the important case of smooth multipartite convex split for classical quantum states, aka smooth multipartite soft covering, our machinery works even when certain marginals of these states do not satisfy pairwise independence. The recent paper (arXiv:2410.17893) gave the first proof of fully smooth multipartite convex split by simplifying and extending a technique called telescoping, developed originally for convex split by (arXiv:2304.12056). However, that work as well as all earlier works on convex split assumed pairwise or even more independence amongst suitable marginals of the quantum states.
  We develop our machinery by leveraging known results from (arXiv:1806.07278) involving tilting and augmentation smoothing of quantum states, combined with a novel observation that a natural quantum operation `flattening' quantum states actually preserves the fidelity. This machinery is powerful enough to lead to non pairwise independent results as mentioned above.
  As an application of our soft covering lemma without pairwise independence, we prove the `natural' one shot inner bounds for sending private classical information over a quantum wiretap interference channel, even when the classical encoders at the input lose pairwise independence in their encoding strategies to a certain extent. This result was unknown earlier even in the classical setting.</description>
