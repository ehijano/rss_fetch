      <title>Coamenability and cospectral radius for orbit equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inclusions $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$ of discrete, probability measure-preserving orbit equivalence relations. In previous work with Ab\'{e}rt-Fra\c{c}zyk, we established the pointwise almost sure existence of the cospectral radius of a random walk on the $\mathcal{R}$-classes. In this paper, we investigate the connections of this cospectral radius to the coamenability of the inclusion $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$. We also undertake a systematic study of coamenability for inclusions of relations, establishing several equivalence formulations of this notion.</description>

      <title>Pressure at infinity on countable Markov shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the pressure at infinity of potentials defined over countable Markov shifts. We establish an upper semi-continuity result concerning the limiting behaviour of the pressure of invariant probability measures, where the escape of mass is controlled by the pressure at infinity. As a consequence, we establish criteria for the existence of equilibrium states and maximizing measures for uniformly continuous potentials. Additionally, we study the pressure at infinity of suspension flows defined over countable Markov shifts and prove an upper semi-continuity result for the pressure map.</description>

      <title>Cubic polynomials with a 2-cycle of Siegel disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under conjugation by affine transformations, the dynamical moduli space of cubic polynomials $f$ with a $2$-cycle of Siegel disks is parameterized by a three-punctured complex plane as a degree-$2$ cover. Assuming the rotation number of $f^2$ on the Siegel disk is of bounded type, we show that on the three-punctured complex plane, the locus of the cubic polynomials with both finite critical points on the boundaries of the Siegel disks on the $2$-cycle is comprised of two arcs, corresponding to the cases with two critical points on the boundary of the same Siegel disk, and a Jordan curve, corresponding to the cases with two critical points on the boundaries of different Siegel disks.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for ultra-fast precessional switching in inertial magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we consider the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic nanoparticles or films driven by external magnetic field pulses directed transverse to the initial equilibrium state. The excitation pulse drives large-angle ultra-fast magnetization dynamics that may eventually end up in the reversed equilibrium realizing successful precessional switching. We consider ultra-short pulse duration (fractions of picosecond) and large external field intensities (several Tesla) which may be relevant for the realization of faster energy-efficient memory cells. For such short time scales, we include inertial effects in the theoretical description by considering the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation which requires to be treated as a system of singularly perturbed ODEs for small values of the inertia. By using suitable perturbation approach based on multiple time scales analysis, we develop an approximate closed-form solution for the switching dynamics as well as formulas for switching time and its safety tolerances to obtain the successful switching as function of physical parameters of the particle and strength of magnetic inertia. The developed analytical solution is validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The role of edge states for early-warning of tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tipping points (TP) are often described as low-dimensional bifurcations, and are associated with early-warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD). CSD is an increase in amplitude and correlation of noise-induced fluctuations away from a reference attractor as the TP is approached. But for high-dimensional systems it is not obvious which variables or observables would display the critical dynamics and carry CSD. Many variables may display no CSD, or show changes in variability not related to a TP. It is thus helpful to identify beforehand which observables are relevant for a given TP. Here we propose this may be achieved by knowledge of an unstable edge state that separates the reference from an alternative attractor that remains after the TP. This is because stochastic fluctuations away from the reference attractor are preferentially directed towards the edge state along a most likely path (the instanton). As the TP is approached the edge state and reference attractor typically become closer, and the fluctuations can evolve further along the instanton. This can be exploited to find observables with substantial CSD, which we demonstrate using conceptual dynamical systems models and climate model simulations of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).</description>

      <title>Residues in Partial Fraction Decomposition Applied to Pole Sensitivity Analysis and Root Locus Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications of the partial fraction decomposition in control and systems engineering are several. In this letter, we propose a new interpretation of residues in the partial fraction decomposition, which is employed for the following purposes: to address the pole sensitivity problem, namely to study the speed of variation of the system poles when the control parameter changes and when the system is subject to parameters variations, as well as to propose a new algorithm for the construction of the root locus. The new algorithm is proven to be more efficient in terms of execution time than the dedicated MATLAB function, while providing the same output results.</description>

      <title>ADAM-SINDy: An Efficient Optimization Framework for Parameterized Nonlinear Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents significant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance understanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing equations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the SINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of established approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This facilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise parameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or polynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an integrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification procedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions. The performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum of dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction kinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations (wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of concurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by nonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to extend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex challenges in dynamical system identification.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Global Stability Notions to Enhance the Rigor and Robustness of Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability theory plays a crucial role in feedback control. However, adaptive control theory requires advanced and specialized stability notions that are not frequently used in standard feedback control theory. The present document is a set of notes for a graduate course. It describes the global stability notions needed in (robust) adaptive control and develops the mathematical tools that are used for the proof of such stability properties. Moreover, the document shows why and how these global stability properties arise in adaptive control. We focus on stability properties for time-invariant systems. Consequently, tracking control problems are not covered by the present document.</description>

      <title>Governing equation discovery of a complex system from snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems in physics, chemistry, and biology that evolve over time with inherent randomness are typically described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A fundamental challenge in science and engineering is to determine the governing equations of a complex system from snapshot data. Traditional equation discovery methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as the availability of the trajectory information or time-series data, and the presumption that the underlying system is deterministic. In this work, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-free framework, called Sparse Identification of Differential Equations from Snapshots (SpIDES), that discovers the governing equations of a complex system from snapshots by utilizing the advanced machine learning techniques to perform three essential steps: probability flow reconstruction, probability density estimation, and Bayesian sparse identification. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of SpIDES by successfully identifying the governing equation of an over-damped Langevin system confined within two potential wells. By extracting interpretable drift and diffusion terms from the SDEs, our framework provides deeper insights into system dynamics, enhances predictive accuracy, and facilitates more effective strategies for managing and simulating stochastic systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct countably many isolated circular orders on the free products $G = F_{2n} \ast \mathbb{Z}_{m_1} \ast \cdots \ast \mathbb{Z}_{m_k}$ of cyclic groups. Moreover, we prove that these isolated circular orders are not the automorphic images of the others. By using these isolated circular orders, we also construct countably many isolated left orders on a certain central $\mathbb{Z}$-extension of $G$, which are not the automorphic images of the others.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, pointwise convergence, uniform convergence and compact convergence of sequences of holomorphic functions on an open subset of the complex plane are compared from a linear point of view. In fact, it is proved the existence of large linear algebras consisting, except for zero, of sequences of holomorphic functions tending to zero compactly but not uniformly on the open set or of sequences of holomorphic functions tending pointwisely to zero but not compactly. Also dense linear subspaces in an appropriate Fr\'echet space as well as infinite dimensional Banach spaces of sequences converging to zero in the mentioned modes are shown to exist.</description>

      <title>On the control of recurrent neural networks using constant inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability properties of a general class of recurrent neural networks that are widely used for hypothesis generation in theoretical neuroscience, including the modeling of large-scale human brain dynamics. Our study focuses on the control synthesis of such networks using constant and piecewise constant inputs, motivated by emerging applications in non-invasive neurostimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The neural network model considered is a continuous Hopfield-type system with nonlinear activation functions and arbitrary input matrices representing interactions among multiple brain regions. Our main contribution is the formulation and solution of a control synthesis problem for these nonlinear systems. We provide a proper generalization of the variation of the constants formula that constitutes a novel representation of the system's state trajectory. This representation admits a verifiable condition on the existence of the constant control input to solve a short-time two-point boundary value problem in the state space. This formulation admits a synthesis for the input in question, which can be realized using modern algorithmic optimization tools. In the case of linear activation functions, this analysis and synthesis reduces to the verification of algebraic conditions on the system matrices. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategies. These results offer a novel control synthesis for an important class of neural network models that may, in turn, enable the design of brain stimulation protocols to modulate whole-brain activity in therapeutic and cognitive enhancement applications.</description>

      <title>Paracomposition Operators and Paradifferential Reducibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducibility methods, aiming to simplify systems by conjugating them to those with constant coefficients, are crucial for studying the existence of quasiperiodic solutions. In KAM theory for PDEs, these methods help address the invertibility of linearized operators that arise in a Nash-Moser/KAM type scheme. The goal of this paper is to prove paradifferential reducibility results, enabling the reduction of nonlinear equations themselves, rather than just their linearizations, to constant coefficient form, modulo smoothing terms. As an initial application, we demonstrate the existence of quasiperiodic solutions for certain hyperbolic systems. Despite the small denominator problem, our proof does not rely on traditional Nash-Moser/KAM-type schemes. To achieve this, we develop two key toolsets. The first focuses on the calculus of paracomposition operators introduced by Alinhac, interpreted as the flow map of a paraproduct vector field. We refine this approach to establish new estimates that precisely capture the dependence on the diffeomorphism in question. The second toolset addresses two classical reducibility problems: one for matrix differential operators and another for nearly parallel vector fields on the torus. We resolve these problems by paralinearizing the conjugacy equation and exploiting, at the paradifferential level, the specific algebraic structure of conjugacy problems, akin to Zehnder's approximate Nash-Moser approach.</description>

      <title>Persistent synchronization of heterogeneous networks with time-dependent linear diffusive coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study synchronization for linearly coupled temporal networks of heterogeneous time-dependent nonlinear agents via the convergence of attracting trajectories of each node. The results are obtained by constructing and studying the stability of a suitable linear nonautonomous problem bounding the evolution of the synchronization errors. Both, the case of the entire network and only a cluster, are addressed and the persistence of the obtained synchronization against perturbation is also discussed. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for the existence of attracting trajectories of each node is given. In all cases, the considered dependence on time requires only local integrability, which is a very mild regularity assumption. Moreover, our results mainly depend on the network structure and its properties, and achieve synchronization up to a constant in finite time. Hence they are quite suitable for applications. The applicability of the results is showcased via several examples: coupled van-der-Pol/FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, weighted/signed opinion dynamics, and coupled Lorenz systems.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive limits beyond the Marcus regime for deterministic fast-slow systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider deterministic fast-slow dynamical systems of the form \[ x_{k+1}^{(n)} = x_k^{(n)} + n^{-1} A(x_k^{(n)}) + n^{-1/\alpha} B(x_k^{(n)}) v(y_k), \quad y_{k+1} = Ty_k, \] where $\alpha\in(1,2)$ and $x_k^{(n)}\in{\mathbb R}^m$. Here, $T$ is a slowly mixing nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical system and the process $W_n(t)=n^{-1/\alpha}\sum_{k=1}^{[nt]}v(y_k)$ converges weakly to a $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process $L_\alpha$.
  We are interested in convergence of the $m$-dimensional process $X_n(t)=x_{[nt]}^{(n)}$ to the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) \[ dX = A(X)\,dt + B(X)\, dL_\alpha. \] In the simplest cases considered in previous work, the limiting SDE has the Marcus interpretation. In particular, the SDE is Marcus if the noise coefficient $B$ is exact or if the excursions for $W_n$ converge to straight lines as $n\to\infty$.
  Outside these simplest situations, it turns out that typically the Marcus interpretation fails. We develop a general theory that does not rely on exactness or linearity of excursions. To achieve this, it is necessary to consider suitable spaces of ``decorated'' c\`adl\`ag paths and to interpret the limiting decorated SDE. In this way, we are able to cover more complicated examples such as billiards with flat cusps where the limiting SDE is typically non-Marcus for $m\ge2$.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity in planar slow-fast systems through slow relation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study ergodic properties of the slow relation function (or entry-exit function) in planar slow-fast systems. It is well known that zeros of the slow divergence integral associated with canard limit periodic sets give candidates for limit cycles. We present a new approach to detect the zeros of the slow divergence integral by studying the structure of the set of all probability measures invariant under the corresponding slow relation function. Using the slow relation function, we also show how to estimate (in terms of weak convergence) the transformation of families of probability measures that describe initial point distribution of canard orbits during the passage near a slow-fast Hopf point (or a more general turning point). We provide formulas to compute exit densities for given entry densities and the slow relation function. We apply our results to slow-fast Li\'{e}nard equations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid PDE-ODE Models for Efficient Simulation of Infection Spread in Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid model combining Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to simulate infectious disease dynamics across geographic regions. By leveraging the spatial detail of PDEs and the computational efficiency of ODEs, the model enables rapid evaluation of public health interventions. Applied to synthetic environments and real-world scenarios in Lombardy, Italy, and Berlin, Germany, the model highlights how interactions between PDE and ODE regions affect infection dynamics, especially in high-density areas. Key findings reveal that the placement of model boundaries in densely populated regions can lead to inaccuracies in infection spread, suggesting that boundaries should be positioned in areas of lower population density to better reflect transmission dynamics. Additionally, regions with low population density hinder infection flow, indicating a need for incorporating, e.g., jumps in the model to enhance its predictive capabilities. Results indicate that the hybrid model achieves a balance between computational speed and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for policymakers in real-time decision-making and scenario analysis in epidemiology and potentially in other fields requiring similar modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Formulating human risk response in epidemic models: exogenous vs endogenous approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent pandemic emphasized the need to consider the role of human behavior in shaping epidemic dynamics. In particular, it is necessary to extend beyond the classical epidemiological structures to fully capture the interplay between the spread of disease and how people respond. Here, we focus on the challenge of incorporating change in human behavior in the form of ``risk response" into compartmental epidemiological models, where humans adapt their actions in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The review examines 37 papers containing over 40 compartmental models, categorizing them into two fundamentally distinct classes: exogenous and endogenous approaches to modeling risk response. While in exogenous approaches, human behavior is often included using different fixed parameter values for certain time periods, endogenous approaches seek for a mechanism internal to the model to explain changes in human behavior as a function of the state of disease. We further discuss two different formulations within endogenous models as implicit versus explicit representation of information diffusion. This analysis provides insights for modelers in selecting an appropriate framework for epidemic modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15169v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that every stable manifold arising from a holomorphic automorphism, that acts hyperbolically on a compact invariant set, is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space. Such stable manifolds are known to be biholomorphic to the basin of a uniformly attracting family of holomorphic maps. It is shown that the basin of a uniformly attracting family of holomorphic maps is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space and this resolves the conjecture on the biholomorphism type of such stable manifolds affirmatively.</description>

      <title>Perfect kernel and dynamics: from Bass-Serre theory to hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce several approaches to studying the Cantor-Bendixson decomposition of and the dynamics on the (topological) space of subgroups for various families of countable groups.
  In particular, we uncover the perfect kernel and the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the space of subgroups of many new groups, including for instance infinitely ended groups, limit groups, hyperbolic 3-manifold groups and many graphs of groups. We also study the topological dynamics of the conjugation action on the perfect kernel, establishing the conditions for topological transitivity and higher topological transitivity. As an application, we obtain many new examples of groups in the class A of Glasner and Monod, i.e. admitting faithful transitive amenable actions. This includes for example right-angled Artin groups, limit groups, finitely presented C'(1/6) small cancellation groups, random groups at density d&lt;1/6, and more generally all virtually compact special groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the stretch factor $\lambda(f)$ of an orientation-reversing fully-punctured pseudo-Anosov map $f$ on a finite-type orientable surface $S$, with $-\chi(S) \geq 4$ and having at least two puncture orbits, satisfies the inequality $\lambda(f)^{-\chi(S)} \geq \sigma^2$, where $\sigma=1+\sqrt{2}$ is the silver ratio. We provide examples showing that this bound is asymptotically sharp. This extends previous results of Hironaka and the third author to orientation-reversing maps.</description>

      <title>Real eternal PDE solutions are not complex entire: a quadratic parabolic example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs, solutions which remain uniformly bounded for all real times $t=r\in\mathbb{R}$ are often called PDE entire or eternal. For example, consider the quadratic parabolic PDE \begin{equation*} \label{*} w_t=w_{xx}+6w^2-\lambda, \tag{*} \end{equation*} for $0&lt;x&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, under Neumann boundary conditions. By its gradient-like structure, all real eternal non-equilibrium orbits $\Gamma(r)$ of \eqref{*} are heteroclinic among equilibria $w=W_n(x)$. All nontrivial real $W_n$ are rescaled and properly translated real-valued Weierstrass elliptic functions with Morse index $i(W_n)=n$.
  We show that the complex time extensions $\Gamma(r+\mathrm{i}s)$, of analytic real heteroclinic orbits towards $W_0=-\sqrt{\lambda/6}$, are not complex entire. For example, consider the time-reversible complex-valued solution $\psi(s)$ of the nonlinear and nonconservative quadratic Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} \label{**} \mathrm{i}\psi_s=\psi_{xx}+6\psi^2-\lambda \tag{**} \end{equation*} with real initial condition $\psi_0=\Gamma(r_0)$. Then there exist $r_0$ such that $\psi(s)$ blows up at some finite real times $\pm s^*$.
  Abstractly, our results are formulated in the setting of analytic semigroups. They are based on Poincar\'e non-resonance of unstable eigenvalues at equilibria $W_n$, near pitchfork bifurcation. Technically, we have to except a discrete set of $\lambda&gt;0$, and are currently limited to unstable dimensions $n\leq22$, or to fast unstable manifolds of dimensions $d&lt;1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}n$.</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>

Abstract: The family of mappings of the plane possessing a biquadratic invariant, which is known collectively as QRT maps, is composed of two involutions, one preserving a vertical shift and the other preserving a horizontal shift in the plane. In this paper, we extend the map by replacing each shift by the group operation on each of two families of elliptic curves, whose product forms a bielliptic surface.</description>
