      <title>Monthly Rural-Urban Scaling of Road Accidents in England, Wales and Scotland (2019-2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge worldwide, with urbanisation and population density identified as key factors influencing risk. This study analyses monthly accident data from 2009 to 2023 across 632 parliamentary constituencies in England, Wales, and Scotland, using an area-normalised approach based on population density. Segmented power law models consistently identified breakpoints separating sublinear rural from superlinear urban scaling behaviours. Seasonal variation in scaling exponents was pronounced in rural regions but less evident in urban ones. Fourier-based cross-spectral analysis of yearly cycles revealed systematic phase shifts: rural exponents lagged pre-exponential factors by 4.5 months, while urban exponents were 2.7 months out of phase, producing a 5.3 month shift between rural and urban exponents. These findings highlight the importance of pre-exponentials-defined as the expected density of accidents at unit population density-as comparable descaled metrics, revealing both long-term national declines and recurring seasonal peaks. Notably, the phase offsets suggest structurally distinct causes of rural and urban accident risk, with urban regions exhibiting increasing acceleration in accident scaling, potentially linked to growth in vehicle numbers, size, and weight. Residuals, modelled with the Type I Generalised Logistic Distribution (GLD), captured skewness and heterogeneity more effectively than normal assumptions. Geospatial mapping highlighted persistent urban hotspots alongside rural and coastal constituencies with systematically lower accident densities than predicted. Together, these findings advance understanding of how density and urbanisation shape accident risk and provide evidence to support more targeted road safety interventions and policy planning.</description>

      <title>Economic thermodynamics and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a computational and theoretical framework inspired by thermodynamic principles to analyze the dynamics of economic inflation within adiabatic and non-adiabatic systems. In a framework referred to as developmental symmetry, inflation is formulated as a scalar field evolving through continuity equations, drawing an analogy with the Raychaudhuri equation in gravitational dynamics. The results show that adiabatic systems fail to reach equilibrium, while non-adiabatic systems can evolve toward stable states over time. The model successfully reproduces observed inflationary regimes-from hyperinflation to stable low-inflation phases-with characteristic transition periods of about a decade. These results indicate that production continuity and controlled monetary flow are crucial for achieving stability in complex economic systems, linking thermodynamic balance to macroeconomic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Pursuing decarbonization and competitiveness: a narrow corridor for European green industrial transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes how Europe can decarbonize its industrial sector while remaining competitive. Using the open-source model PyPSA-Eur, it examines key energy- and emission-intensive industries, including steel, cement, methanol, ammonia, and high-value chemicals. Two development paths are explored: a continued decline in industrial activity and a reindustrialization driven by competitiveness policies. The analysis assesses cost gaps between European green products and lower-cost imports, and evaluates strategies such as intra-European relocation, selective imports of green intermediates, and targeted subsidies. Results show that deep industrial decarbonization is technically feasible, led by electrification, but competitiveness depends strongly on policy choices. Imports of green intermediates can lower costs while preserving jobs and production, whereas broad subsidies are economically unsustainable. Effective policy should focus support on sectors like ammonia and steel finishing while maintaining current production levels.</description>

      <title>Modelling and evaluating travel information during disruptions: An illustrative example from Swedish railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely travel information is an asset for enhancing passenger travel experience during normal traffic, and for mitigating the discomforts during disruptions. With longer and more frequent disruptions as well as increasing ridership, traffic delays can incur substantial costs for passengers and other transport stakeholders, e.g., operators and infrastructure managers. Such costs can, however, be reduced thanks to effective travel information strategies during traffic disruptions. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation model to assess the value of travel information under different scenarios. Focusing on real-time travel information to train passengers, accessibility benefits are quantified in monetary terms based on historical delay distributions, timing of travel information (pre/on-trip) and ridership. Using a case study from the Swedish railways, the model is showcased and applied to a commuter line in Stockholm. The experimental results indicate individual valuations that are higher than references and savings at the system level of at least 23% of the delay costs. Further testing of the model, e.g., on larger-scale scenarios, and including transfer trips, is a possible direction for future works.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Quota Policies Across STEM, Biological, and Humanities Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine more than a decade of quota policy at Unesp, analyzing Physics, Biology, and Pedagogy as representative programs of distinct assessment styles. Quotas show little impact in Physics, where the admission barrier is low, and in Pedagogy, where high pass rates make it difficult to differentiate students, but they reveal systematic differences in Biology. Focusing the analysis on Calculus I - an introductory course in Physics and other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs - for which much larger statistics are available, a clear hierarchy emerges: students admitted through open competition perform best, those from public schools achieve intermediate results, and students from racial quotas perform worst. When students are divided directly by the admittance exam grade, the performance difference is even clearer. Statistical analysis also shows that, contrary to expectation, the probability of passing decreases as the number of attempts increases, indicating that initial educational gaps are difficult to overcome within higher education.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points and Stochastic Meritocracies: A Long-Term Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study group fairness in the context of feedback loops induced by meritocratic selection into programs that themselves confer additional advantage, like college admissions. We introduce a novel stylized inter-generational model for the setting and analyze it in situations where there are no underlying differences between two populations. We show that, when the benefit of the program (or the harm of not getting into it) is completely symmetric, disparities between the two populations will eventually dissipate. However, the time an accumulated advantage takes to dissipate could be significant, and increases substantially as a function of the relative importance of the program in conveying benefits. We also find that significant disparities can arise due to chance even from completely symmetric initial conditions, especially when populations are small. The introduction of even a slight asymmetry, where the group that has accumulated an advantage becomes slightly preferred, leads to a completely different outcome. In these instances, starting from completely symmetric initial conditions, disparities between groups arise stochastically and then persist over time, yielding a permanent advantage for one group. Our analysis precisely characterizes conditions under which disparities persist or diminish, with a particular focus on the role of the scarcity of available spots in the program and its effectiveness. We also present extensive simulations in a richer model that further support our theoretical results in the simpler, stylized model. Our findings are relevant for the design and implementation of algorithmic fairness interventions in similar selection processes.</description>

      <title>DemandCast: Global hourly electricity demand forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning framework for electricity demand forecasting across diverse geographical regions using the gradient boosting algorithm XGBoost. The model integrates historical electricity demand and comprehensive weather and socioeconomic variables to predict normalized electricity demand profiles. To enable robust training and evaluation, we developed a large-scale dataset spanning multiple years and countries, applying a temporal data-splitting strategy that ensures benchmarking of out-of-sample performance. Our approach delivers accurate and scalable demand forecasts, providing valuable insights for energy system planners and policymakers as they navigate the challenges of the global energy transition.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Fairness of Voting Systems: Simulating Violations of Arrow's Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds upon the work of Dougherty and Heckelman (2020) by determining the frequency that 13 voting systems violate Arrow's social choice criteria with up to six alternatives. These results determine which of the 13 voting systems, is the fairest based on their probabilistic likelihood of violating Arrow's social choice criteria. The voting systems considered are: Plurality, Borda, Dowdall, Top Two, Hare, Coombs, Baldwin, Copeland, Anti-Plurality, Nanson, Ranked Pairs, Pairwise Majority, and Minimax. Elections with up to 10,000 voters and between three and six alternatives are simulated using both Impartial Culture and Impartial Anonymous Culture. These simulations show that Pairwise Majority is the least likely to jointly violate Arrow's criteria. As the number of alternatives increases, the joint-violation frequencies increase for each voting method. For all systems except Pairwise Majority, the joint-violation frequencies in elections with at least 30 voters and four alternatives are greater than 98%.</description>

      <title>Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves: Representation, measurements and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. The past 5 years have seen an explosion in the availability of large-scale traffic data containing traffic waves and complex congestion patterns, making existing approaches unsuitable for repeatable and scalable analysis of traffic waves in these data. This paper makes a first step towards addressing this challenge by introducing an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. It enables the measurement of wave properties at scale. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. Our results show insights on the complexity of traffic waves. Traffic waves can bifurcate and merge at a scale that has never been observed or described before. The clustering analysis of all the identified wave components reveals the different topological structures of traffic waves. We explored that the wave merge or bifurcation points can be explained by spatial features. The gallery of all the identified wave topologies is demonstrated at https://trafficwaves.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Recommendations and tools to enable reproducibility in 2D materials research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on 2D materials has achieved significant milestones and fuelled a rapidly growing industrial sector. This progress, however, is accompanied by challenges in reproducibility, arising from the atomic thinness, fragility, and environmental sensitivity of these materials. Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.</description>

      <title>Measures of net effects in signed social and ecological networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With improvements in data resolution and quality, researchers can now represent complex systems as signed, weighted, and directed networks. In this article, we introduce a framework for measuring net and indirect effects without simplifying these information-rich networks. It captures both direct and indirect interactions, the effect of the whole network on a node, and conversely, the effect of a node on the entire network, while accommodating the complexity of signed, weighted, and directed links. Our taxonomy unifies and extends existing approaches and measures from network science, computational social science, and ecological networks. We demonstrate its value in ecological systems, where net and indirect effects are critical yet difficult to quantify. Using generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics, we find a strong correlation between negative net effects and species extinction. We further apply the framework to a real-world social network, where it identifies informative rankings that illuminate influence propagation and power dynamics.</description>

      <title>Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.</description>
