      <title>Existence of BV solutions for $2\times2$ hyperbolic balance laws for $L^\infty$ initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of BV solutions for $2\times 2$ system of hyperbolic balance laws in one space dimension. The flux is assumed to have two genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields. We consider a general force which may possibly depend on time and space variable as well. To prove the existence, we assume the initial data to be small in $L^\infty$. Furthermore, we also study qualitative behavior for entropy solutions to hyperbolic system of balance laws.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Solutions for the Nonlocal Wave Equation on Periodic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the regularity of solutions for a nonlocal wave equation over the space of periodic distributions. The spatial operator for the nonlocal wave equation is given by a nonlocal Laplace operator with a compactly supported integral kernel. We follow a unified approach based on the Fourier multipliers of the nonlocal Laplace operator, which allows the study of regular as well as distributional solutions of the nonlocal wave equation, integrable as well as singular kernels, in any spatial dimension. In addition, the results extend beyond operators with singular kernels to nonlocal-pseudo differential operators. We present results on the spatial and temporal regularity of solutions in terms of regularity of the initial data or the forcing term. Moreover, solutions of the nonlocal wave equation are shown to converge to the solution of the classical wave equation for two types of limits: as the spatial nonlocality vanishes or as the singularity of the integral kernel approaches a certain critical singularity that depends on the spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Rayleigh equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh equation, which is the linearized Euler equations near a shear flow in vorticity formulation, is a key ingredient in the study of the long time behavior of solutions of linearized Euler equations, in the study of the linear stability of shear flows for Navier-Stokes equations and in particular in the construction of the so called Tollmien-Schlichting waves. It is also a key ingredient in the study of vorticity depletion.
  In this article we locally describe the solutions of Rayleigh equation near critical points of any order of degeneracy, and link their values on the boundary with their behaviors at infinity.</description>

      <title>Global regularity and optimal decay estimates of large solutions to the compressible FENE system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the compressible FENE dumbbell model. By virtue of the dissipative structure and the interpolation method, we firstly prove global regularity in $H^2$ framework for the compressible FENE system with some large data. Then, we obtain optimal decay estimates of large solutions in $H^1$ and remove the smallness assumption of low frequencies by virtue of the Fourier splitting method and the Littlewood-Paley decomposition theory. Furthermore, we establish optimal decay rate for the highest derivative of the solutions by a different method combining time frequency decomposition and the time weighted energy estimate. These obtained results generalize and cover the classical results of the incompressible FENE dumbbell model.</description>

      <title>Determining Modes, Synchronization, and Intertwinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the interrelation between the determining modes property in the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) of incompressible fluids and the synchronization property of two filtering algorithms for continuous data assimilation applied to the 2D NSE. These two properties are realized as manifestations of a more general phenomenon of "self-synchronous intertwinement". It is shown that this concept is a logically stronger form of asymptotic enslavement, as characterized by the existence of finitely many determining modes in the 2D NSE. In particular, this stronger form is shown to imply convergence of the synchronization filter and the nudging filter from continuous data assimilation (CDA), and then subsequently invoked to show that convergence in these filters implies that the 2D NSE possesses finitely many determining modes. The main achievement of this article is to therefore identify a new concept, that of self-synchronous intertwinement, through which a rigorous relationship between the determining modes property and synchronization in these CDA filters is established and made decisively clear. The theoretical results are then complemented by numerical experiments that confirm the conclusions of the theorems.</description>

      <title>Boundary C^{\alpha}-regularity for solutions of elliptic equations with distributional coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the boundary pointwise $C^{0}$-regularity of weak solutions for Dirichlet problem of elliptic equations in divergence form with distributional coefficients, where the boundary value equals to zero. This is a generalization of the interior case. If $\Omega$ satisfies some measure condition at one boundary point, the bilinear mapping $\langle V\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ generalized by distributional coefficient $V$ can be controlled by a constant sufficiently small, the nonhomogeneous terms satisfy some Dini decay conditions, then the solution is continuous at this point in the $L^{2}$ sense.</description>

      <title>One dimensional energy cascades in a fractional quasilinear NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer of energy to high frequencies in a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with sublinear dispersion, on the one dimensional torus. We exhibit initial data undergoing finite but arbitrary large Sobolev norm explosion: their initial norm is arbitrary small in Sobolev spaces of high regularity, but at a later time becomes arbitrary large. We develop a novel mechanism producing instability, which is based on extracting, via paradifferential normal forms, an effective equation driving the dynamics whose leading term is a non-trivial transport operator with non-constant coefficients. We prove that such operator is responsible for energy cascades via a positive commutator estimate inspired by Mourre's commutator theory.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Effective Model in the Time-Domain for Acoustic Waves Propagating in Bubbly Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the effective medium theory for the linearized time-domain acoustic waves propagating in a bubbly media. The analysis is done in the time-domain avoiding the need to use Fourier transformation. This allows considering general incident waves avoiding band limited ones as usually used in the literature. Most importantly, the outcome is as follows: 1. As the bubbles are resonating, with the unique subwavelength Minnaert resonance, the derived effective wave model is dispersive. Precisely, the effective acoustic model is an integro-differential one with a time-convolution term highlighting the resonance effect. 2. The periodicity in distributing the cluster of bubbles is not needed, contrary to the case of using traditional two-scale homogenization procedures. Precisely, given any $C^1$-smooth function $K$, we can distribute the bubbles so that locally the number of such bubbles is dictated by $K$. In addition to its dispersive character, the effective model is affected by the function $K$. Such freedom and generality is appreciable in different applied sciences including materials sciences and mathematical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel first-order derivative for functions on a lattice graph, which extend the discrete Laplacian and generalize the theory of discrete PDE on the lattices. First, we establish the well-posedness of generalized quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations and global well-posedness of semilinear Schr\"odinger equations. Then we give explicit expressions of higher order derivatives of solution map and prove analytic dependence between solution and initial datum. In the end, we show the existence of wave operator and give a sufficient condition for asymptotic completeness.</description>

      <title>Parametric holomorphy of elliptic eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (parametric PDEs) with countably many parameters has been actively studied for the last few decades. In particular, it has been well known that a certain type of parametric holomorphy of the PDE solutions allows the application of deep neural networks without encountering the curse of dimensionality. This paper aims to propose a general framework for verifying the desired parametric holomorphy by utilizing the bounds on parametric derivatives. The framework is illustrated with examples of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems (EVPs), encompassing both linear and semilinear cases. As the results, it will be shown that the ground eigenpairs have the desired holomorphy. Furthermore, under the same conditions, improved bounds for the mixed derivatives of the ground eigenpairs are derived. These bounds are well known to take a crucial role in the error analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a brief survey of recent results on axially symmetric Navier-Stokes equations (ASNS) in the following categories: regularity criterion, Liouville property for ancient solutions, decay and vanishing of stationary solutions. Some discussions also touch on the full 3 dimensional equations. Two results, closing of the scaling gap for ASNS and vanishing of homogeneous D solutions in 3 dimensional slabs will be described in more detail. In the addendum, two new results in the 3rd category will also be presented, which are generalizations of recently published results by the author and coauthors.</description>

      <title>Existence and Stability of Localized Patterns in the Population Models with Large Advection and Strong Allee Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong Allee effect plays an important role on the evolution of population in ecological systems. One important concept is the Allee threshold that determines the persistence or extinction of the population in a long time. In general, a small initial population size is harmful to the survival of a species since when the initial data is below the Allee threshold the population tends to extinction, rather than persistence. Another interesting feature of population evolution is that a species whose movement strategy follows a conditional dispersal strategy is more likely to persist. In other words, the biased movement can be a benefit for the persistence of the population. The coexistence of the above two conflicting mechanisms makes the dynamics rather intricate. However, some numerical results obtained by Cosner et. al. (SIAM J. Appl. Math., Vol. 81, No. 2, 2021) show that the directed movement can invalidate the strong Allee effect and help the population survive. To study this intriguing phenomenon, we consider the pattern formation and local dynamics for a class of single species population models of that is subject to the strong Allee effect. We first rigorously show the existence of multiple localized solutions when the directed movement is strong enough. Next, the spectrum analysis of the associated linear eigenvalue problem is established and used to investigate the stability properties of these interior spikes. This analysis proves that there exists not only unstable but also linear stable steady states. Then, we extend results of the single equation to coupled systems, and also construct several non-constant steady states and analyze their stability. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Convergence of critical points for a phase-field approximation of 1D cohesive fracture energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational models for cohesive fracture are based on the idea that the fracture energy is released gradually as the crack opening grows. Recently, [Conti, Focardi, and Iurlano, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e C Anal. Non Lin\'eaire, 2016] proposed a variational approximation via $\Gamma$-convergence of a class of cohesive fracture energies by phase-field energies of Ambrosio-Tortorelli type, which may be also used as regularization for numerical simulations. In this paper we address the question of the asymptotic behaviour of critical points of the phase-field energies in the one-dimensional setting: we show that they converge to a selected class of critical points of the limit functional. Conversely, each critical point in this class can be approximated by a family of critical points of the phase-field functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider semiclassically scaled, weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with external confining potentials and additional angular-momentum rotation term. This type of model arises in the Gross-Pitaevskii theory of trapped, rotating quantum gases. We construct asymptotic solutions in the form of semiclassical wave-packets, which are concentrated in both space and in frequency around an classical Hamiltonian phase-space flow. The rotation term is thereby seen to alter this flow, but not the corresponding classical action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of Mean-field Games (MFG) systems in the mass critical exponent case. We firstly establish the optimal Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality associated with the potential-free MFG system. Then, under some mild assumptions on the potential function, we show that there exists a critical mass $M^*$ such that the MFG system admits a least energy solution if and only if the total mass of population density $M$ satisfies $M&lt;M^*$. Moreover, the blow-up behavior of energy minimizers are captured as $M\nearrow M^*$. In particular, given the precise asymptotic expansions of the potential, we establish the refined blow-up behavior of ground states as $M\nearrow M^*.$ While studying the existence of least energy solutions, we establish new local $W^{2,p}$ estimates of solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations with superlinear gradient terms.</description>

      <title>On the stability of Type I self-similar blowups for the Keller-Segel system in three dimensions and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in spatial dimensions $d\geq3$, which corresponds to the mass supercritical case. Some solutions become singular in finite time, an important example being backward self-similar solutions. Herrero et al. and Brenner et al. showed the existence of such profiles, countably many in dimensions $3\leq d \leq 9$ and at least two for $d\geq 10$. We establish that all these self-similar profiles are stable along a set of initial data with finite Lipschitz codimension equal to the number of instable eigenmodes. This extends the recent finding of Glogi\'c et al. showing the stability of the fundamental self-similar profile. We obtain additional results, such as the possibility of the solutions we construct to originate from smooth and compactly supported initial data, their convergence at blow-up time, and the Lipschitz regularity of the blow-up time. Our proof extends the approach proposed in Collot et al., based on renormalizing the solution around a modulated self-similar solution, and using a spectral gap for the linearized operator in the parabolic neighbourhood of the singularity.</description>

      <title>A PDE approach to the existence and regularity of surfaces of minimum mean curvature variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic theory of existence and regularity of surfaces (given by graphs) arising from the geometric minimization problem $$\min_{\mathcal{M}}\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathcal{M}}|\nabla_{\mathcal{M}}H|^2\,dA$$ where $\mathcal{M}$ ranges over all $n$-dimensional manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with prescribed boundary, $\nabla_{\mathcal{M}}H$ is the tangential gradient along $\mathcal{M}$ of the mean curvature $H$ of $\mathcal{M}$ and $dA$ is the differential of surface area. The minimizers, called surfaces of minimum mean curvature variation, are central in applications of computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing and mechanics. Our main results show the existence of both smooth surfaces and of variational solutions to the minimization problem together with geometric regularity results. These are the first analytic results available on the literature for this problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modeling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modeling the visual MacKay effect [D. M. MacKay, Nature, 180 (1957), pp. 849--850]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in MacKay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multiscale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modeling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>

      <title>On particle systems and critical strengths of general singular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For finite interacting particle systems with strong repulsing-attracting or general interactions, we prove global weak well-posedness almost up to the critical threshold of the strengths of attracting interactions (independent of the number of particles), and establish other regularity results, such as a heat kernel bound in the regions where strongly attracting particles are close to each other. Our main analytic instruments are a variant of De Giorgi's method in $L^p$ with appropriately chosen large $p$, and an abstract desingularization theorem.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of the ballistic-conductive model of heat conduction: the reverse side of the coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heat equation, based on Fourier's law, is commonly used for description of heat conduction. However, Fourier's law is valid under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is violated in very small dimensions and short timescales, and at low temperatures. In the paper R. Kovacs and P. Van, Generalized heat conduction in heat pulse experiments, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 83:613-620, 2015, a ballistic-conductive (BC) model of heat conduction was developed. In this paper, we study the behavior of solutions to an initial value problem (IVP) in 1D in the framework of the linearized ballistic-conductive (BC) model. As a result of the study, an unphysical effect has been found when part of the initial thermal energy does not spread anywhere.</description>
