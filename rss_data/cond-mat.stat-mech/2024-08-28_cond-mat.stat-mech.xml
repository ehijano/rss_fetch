      <title>Viscosity as the product of its low-concentration value times a thermodynamic function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of viscosity, $\eta$, as a function of concentration in dense fluids remains an unsolved problem, as is the case with other transport coefficients. Boltzmann's theory and the Chapman-Enskog method predict the value of the viscosity at low concentrations, $\eta_0$. Here, the hypothesis $\eta=\phi\, \eta_0$ is proposed, where $\phi$ is a thermodynamic function representing the effects of interactions as concentration increases. The method proposed to verify this hypothesis involves coupling the system with a solvent represented by a Langevin thermostat, characterized by a damping time $t_d$. Molecular dynamics simulations show that different values of noise intensity modify $\eta$ and $\eta_0$, but do not affect $\phi$. This result supports the assumption that $\phi$ is a thermodynamic function, since the thermodynamic state remains unaltered by the presence of damping and noise. Simulations were conducted for particles that interact via a pseudo-hard sphere or a Lennard-Jones potential.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Finite-Size Scaling of the Four-Dimensional Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-theoretical calculations predict that, at the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$, the finite-size scaling (FSS) behaviors of the Ising model would be modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections with thermal and magnetic correction exponents $(\hat{y}_t, \hat{y}_h)=(1/6,1/4)$. Using high-efficient cluster algorithms and the lifted worm algorithm, we present a systematic study of the FSS of the four-dimensional Ising model in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) bond and loop representations. Our numerical results reveal the FSS behaviors of various geometric and physical quantities in the three representations, offering robust evidence for the logarithmic correction form conjectured by the field theory. In particular, clear evidence is obtained for the existence of $\hat{y}_t=1/6$ in the loop representation, while it is difficult to extract in the spin representations, because of mixing with the Gaussian-fixed-point asymptotics. In the FK-bond representation, the multiplicative logarithmic correction for the second-largest cluster is also numerically observed to be governed by an exponent $\hat{y}_{h2} = -1/4$ with its exact value unknown yet.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation, Capillarity, and Odd Surface Flows in Chiral Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active phase separations evade canonical thermodynamic descriptions and have thus challenged our understanding of coexistence and interfacial phenomena. Considerable progress has been made towards a non-equilibrium theoretical description of these traditionally thermodynamic concepts. Spatial parity symmetry is conspicuously assumed in much of this progress, despite the ubiquity of chirality in experimentally realized systems. In this Letter, we derive a theory for the phase coexistence and interfacial fluctuations of a system which microscopically violates spatial parity. We find suppression of the phase separation as chirality is increased as well as the development of steady-state currents tangential to the interface dividing the phases. These odd flows are irrelevant to stationary interfacial properties, with stability, capillary fluctuations, and surface area minimization determined entirely by the capillary surface tension. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations, we find excellent agreement with our theoretical scaling predictions.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity, and despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this Letter, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate its emergence in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Squeezing light to get non-classical work in quantum engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light can be squeezed by reducing the quantum uncertainty of the electric field for some phases. We show how to use this purely-quantum effect to extract net mechanical work from radiation pressure in a simple quantum photon engine. Along the way, we demonstrate that the standard definition of work in quantum systems is not appropriate in this context, as it does not capture the energy leaked to these quantum degrees of freedom. We use these results to design an Otto engine able to produce mechanical work from squeezing baths, in the absence of thermal gradient. Interestingly, while work extraction from squeezing generally improves for low temperatures, there exists a nontrivial squeezing-dependent temperature for which work production is maximal, demonstrating the complex interplay between thermal and squeezing effects.</description>

      <title>Allosteric communication mediated by protein contact clusters: A dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allostery refers to the puzzling phenomenon of long-range communication between distant sites in proteins. Despite its importance in biomolecular regulation and signal transduction, the underlying dynamical process is not well understood. This study introduces a dynamical model of allosteric communication based on "contact clusters"-localized groups of highly correlated contacts that facilitate interactions between secondary structures. The model shows that allostery involves a multi-step process with cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters mediated by rigid secondary structures. Considering time-dependent experiments on a photoswitchable PDZ3 domain, extensive (in total $\sim 500\,\mu$s) molecular dynamics simulations are conducted that directly monitor the photoinduced allosteric transition. The structural reorganization is illustrated by the time evolution of the contact clusters and the ligand, which affects the nonlocal coupling between distant clusters. A timescale analysis reveals dynamics from nano- to microseconds, which are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured timescales.</description>

      <title>How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for generative models of sequences on trees, enabling control over the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformer architectures can implement the optimal Belief Propagation algorithm on both root classification and masked language modeling tasks. Correlations at larger distances corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy are sequentially included as the network is trained. We analyze how the transformer layers succeed by focusing on attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering. These attention maps show clear evidence for iterative hierarchical reconstruction of correlations, and we can relate these observations to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm for the network sizes considered.</description>

      <title>q-neighbor Ising model on a polarized network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the interplay between the lobby size $q$ in the $q$-neighbor Ising model of opinion formation [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 92}, 052105] and the level of overlap $v$ of two fully connected graphs. Results suggest that for each lobby size $q \ge 3$, a specific level of overlap $v^*$ exists, which destroys initially polarized clusters of opinions. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, backed by an analytical approach, we show that the dependence of the $v^*$ on the lobby size $q$ is far from trivial in the absence of temperature, showing consecutive maximum and minimum, that additionally depends on the parity of $q$. The temperature is, in general, a destructive factor; its increase leads to the collapse of polarized clusters for smaller values of $v$ and additionally brings a substantial decrease in the level of polarization. However, we show that this behavior is counter-intuitively inverted for specific lobby sizes and temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>General Theory of Static Response for Markov Jump Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Markov jump processes on a graph described by a rate matrix that depends on various control parameters. We derive explicit expressions for the static responses of edge currents and steady-state probabilities. We show that they are constrained by the graph topology (i.e. the incidence matrix) by deriving response relations (i.e. linear constraints linking the different responses) and topology-dependent bounds. For unicyclic networks, all scaled current responses are between zero and one and must sum to one. Applying these results to stochastic thermodynamics, we derive explicit expressions for the static response of fundamental currents (which carry the full dissipation) to fundamental thermodynamic forces (which drive the system away from equilibrium).</description>

      <title>Structural Stability Hypothesis of Dual Unitary Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale. To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Dissipation bounds precision of current response to kinetic perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision of currents in Markov networks is bounded by dissipation via the so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). In our work, we demonstrate a similar inequality that bounds the precision of the static current response to perturbations of kinetic barriers. Perturbations of such type, which affect only the system kinetics but not the thermodynamic forces, are highly important in biochemistry and nanoelectronics. We prove that our inequality cannot be derived from the standard TUR. Instead, it implies the standard TUR and provides an even tighter bound for dissipation. We also provide a procedure for obtaining the optimal response precision for a given model.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss second-order phase transitions including structural and superconducting transitions and first-order transitions including melting and boiling. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. An interesting byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. Generalising this insight to other levels of structure in the Universe, this suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, act to increase the phase space and entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study negative large deviations of the long-time empirical front velocity in the one-sided $N$-BBM ($N$-particle branching Brownian motion) model in one dimension. Employing the macroscopic fluctuation theory, we evaluate the probability density that the front velocity $c$ is smaller than the limiting velocity $c_0$, predicted by the deterministic theory. We show that for $c_0-c\ll c_0$ the corresponding rate function $s(c)$ coincides, up to a numerical factor, with the similar rate functions for other front models belonging to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov universality class. For large negative values of $c$, $s(c)$ approaches a simple bound, obtained under the assumption that the branching is completely suppressed during the whole time.</description>

Abstract: One of the primary motivations of the research in the field of computation is to optimize the cost of computation. The major ingredient that a computer needs is the energy to run a process, i.e., the thermodynamic cost. The analysis of the thermodynamic cost of computation is one of the prime focuses of research. It started back since the seminal work of Landauer where it was commented that the computer spends kB T ln2 amount of energy to erase a bit of information (here T is the temperature of the system and kB represents the Boltzmann's constant). The advancement of statistical mechanics has provided us the necessary tool to understand and analyze the thermodynamic cost for the complicated processes that exist in nature, even the computation of modern computers. The advancement of physics has helped us to understand the connection of the statistical mechanics (the thermodynamics cost) with computation. Another important factor that remains a matter of concern in the field of computer science is the error correction of the error that occurs while transmitting the information through a communication channel. Here in this article, we have reviewed the progress of the thermodynamics of computation starting from Landauer's principle to the latest model, which simulates the modern complex computation mechanism. After exploring the salient parts of computation in computer science theory and information theory, we have reviewed the thermodynamic cost of computation and error correction. We have also discussed about the alternative computation models that have been proposed with thermodynamically cost-efficient.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Effect of chemical short-range order and percolation on passivation in binary alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a percolation model for face centered cubic binary alloys with chemical short-range order (SRO) to account for chemical ordering/clustering that occurs in nominally random solid solutions. We employ a lattice generation scheme that directly utilizes the first nearest neighbor Warren-Cowley SRO parameter to generate the lattice. We quantify the effects of SRO on the first nearest neighbor three-dimensional (3D) site percolation threshold using the large cell Monte Carlo renormalization group method and find that the 3D site percolation threshold is a function of the SRO parameter. We analyze the effects of SRO on the distribution of the total number of distinct clusters in the percolated structures and find that short-ranged clustering promotes the formation of a dominant spanning cluster. Furthermore, we find that the scaling exponents of percolation are independent of SRO. We also examine the effects of SRO on the 2D-3D percolation crossover and find that the thickness of the thin film for percolation crossover is a function of the SRO parameter. We combine these results to develop a percolation crossover model to understand the electrochemical passivation behavior in binary alloys. The percolation crossover model provides a theoretical framework to understand the critical composition of passivating elements for protective oxide formation. With this model, we show that SRO can be used as a processing parameter to improve corrosion resistance.</description>

      <title>A statistical analysis of the first stages of freezing and melting of Lennard-Jones particles: Number and size distributions of transient nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The freezing/melting transition is at the heart of many natural and industrial processes. In the classical picture, the transition proceeds via the nucleation of the new phase, which has to overcome a barrier associated to the free energy cost of the growing nucleus. The total nucleation rate is also influenced by a kinetic factor which somehow depends on the number of attempts to create a nucleus, that translates into a significant density of proto-nuclei in the system. These transient tiny nuclei are not accessible to experiments, but they can be observed in molecular simulations, and their number and size distributions can be acquired and analysed. The number distributions are carefully characterized as a function of the system size, showing the expected behavior, with limited spurious effects due to the finite simulation box. It is also shown that the proto-nuclei do exist even in the stable phase, in agreement with the fact that the (unfavorable) volume contribution to their free energy is negligible in the first stages of nucleation. Moreover, the number and size distributions evolve continuously between the stable and the metastable phases, in particular when crossing the coexistence temperature. The size distributions associated to \textit{any} nucleus and to the \textit{largest} one have also been calculated, and their relationship recently established for bubbles in a liquid [J. Puibasset, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 191102 (2022)] has been shown to apply here. This is an important relation for free energy barrier calculations with biased molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of metachronal waves in a chain of symmetrically beating filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that metachronal waves (MCWs) can emerge from a chain of symmetrically beating nematodes aligned at the edge of sessile droplets. Our study, employing a coupled elastohydrodynamic model of active filaments, elucidates that a misalignment caused by a tilt against the bounding wall disrupts the synchronization and generates a constant time lag between adjacent filaments, giving rise to MCWs. The MCWs, enhancing the fluid circulation, achieve their maximum thermodynamic efficiency over the same range of tilt angles observed in the nematode experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>
