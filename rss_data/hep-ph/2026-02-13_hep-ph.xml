      <title>Improved results of chiral limit study with the large $N_c$ standard U(3) ChPT inputs in the on-shell renormalized quark-meson model</title>

Abstract: When the $f_{\pi}, f_{K} \text{ and } M_{\eta}^2$ given by the $ (m_{\pi},m_{K}) $ dependent scaling relations of the large $N_{c}$ standard U(3) Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the infrared regularized U(3) ChPT,~are used in the on-shell renormalized 2+1 flavor quark-meson (RQM) model to find its parameters in the path to the chiral limit $(m_{\pi},m_{K}) \rightarrow 0$ away from the physical point $ (m_{\pi}^{\text{\tiny{Phys}}},m_{K}^{\text{\tiny{Phys}}})=(138,496) $ MeV,~one gets the respective framework of RQM-S model and RQM-I model.~Computing and comprehensively comparing the RQM-S and I model Columbia plots for the $m_{\sigma}=400,500\text{ and }600$ MeV,~it has been shown that the use of large $N_c$ standard U(3) ChPT inputs give the better and improved framework for the Chiral limit studies as the RQM-S model tricritical lines show the expected saturation pattern after becoming flat in the vertical meson (quark) mass $\mu-m_{K}$ ($\mu-m_{s}$) plane for all the cases of $m_{\sigma}$ whereas the divergent RQM-I model tricritical line for the $m_{\sigma}=500$ MeV becomes strongly divergent when the $m_{\sigma}=600$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Pion $\beta$ decay and $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ beyond leading logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consistent matching of short-distance contributions and hadronic matrix elements is crucial for precise predictions of weak processes involving hadrons. In this Letter, we address this point for charged-current processes involving two pions -- pion $\beta$ decay $\pi^\pm\to\pi^0 e^\pm\nu_e$ and hadronic $\tau$ decays $\tau^\pm\to\pi^\pm\pi^0\nu_\tau$ -- whose decay rates depend on the so-called $\gamma W$ box correction. Using recent results from lattice QCD, we show how to formulate the matching beyond leading-logarithmic accuracy, in particular, how to cancel the dependence on the scheme choice for evanescent operators. As main results, we obtain a prediction for the decay rate of pion $\beta$ decay with theory uncertainties improved by a factor of three, which renders theory uncertainties negligible for future determinations of $V_{ud}$ even beyond the reach of the PIONEER experiment, and an evaluation of isospin-breaking corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ with negligible uncertainty from the short-distance matching, as necessary for a future $\tau$-based determination of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.</description>

      <title>The X17 with Chiral Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the ATOMKI collaboration has performed a series of measurements of excited nuclei, observing a resonant excess of electron-positron pairs at large opening angles compared to the Standard Model prediction. The excess has been hypothesized to be due to the production of a new spin-1 or spin-0 particle, X17, with a mass of about 17 MeV. Recently, the PADME experiment has reported an excess in the $e^+e^-$ cross section at center-of-mass energies near 17 MeV, perhaps further hinting at the existence of a new state. Studies of the spin-1 case have hitherto focused on either vector {\em or} axial-vector couplings to quarks and leptons, whereas UV theories more naturally produce {\em both} vector and axial-vector (\textit{i.e.} chiral) couplings, analogous to the Standard Model weak interactions. We consider the ATOMKI anomalies in the context of an $X$ with chiral couplings to quarks and explore the parameter space that can explain the ATOMKI anomalies, contrasting them with experimental constraints. We find that it is possible to accommodate the reported ATOMKI signals. However, the $99\%$ CL region is in tension with null results from searches for atomic parity violation and direct searches for new low mass physics coupled to electrons. This tension is found to be driven by the magnitude of the reported excess in the transition of $^{12}{\rm C}(17.23)$, which drives the best-fit region towards excluded couplings.</description>

      <title>Thermal precondensation in gauge-fermion theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precondensation is a peculiar phenomenon in phase transitions, characterised by the occurrence of a condensate only over a finite range of length scales. It is closely connected to the emergence of domains, pseudo-gapped phases and spatial inhomogeneities in equilibrium. In this work, we show its occurrence in gauge-fermion theories in the chiral limit, close to the thermal chiral phase transition. We further show that the precondensation regime becomes increasingly pronounced and extends over a wider temperature range as the number of fermion flavours is increased. We analyse the underlying dynamics which is shared by a broad class of fermionic systems, ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics. Specifically, we discuss the potential relevance of this phenomenon for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Fate of $\theta_{12}$ under $\mu-\tau$ Reflection Symmetry in Light of the First JUNO Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent JUNO measurements of $\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ open a new avenue for probing flavor symmetric structures in the lepton sector. Motivated by this, we study a model in which $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry naturally emerges from an underlying $A_4$ flavor symmetry within a type-II seesaw framework. Beyond its standard predictions of $\theta_{23}=45^{\circ}$ and $\delta_{\rm CP}=\pm \pi/2$, the framework yields testable predictions for $\theta_{12}$ that can be probed by JUNO. Two viable scenarios arise, one predicting $\sin^2\theta_{12} \gsim 0.335$, which is strongly disfavored by the latest JUNO results. Correlations between $\theta_{12}$ and model parameters further enhance the model's predictivity. Future measurements at DUNE and T2HK will provide complementary tests of this scenario.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark axion portal: missing energy and fermion EDMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model in which a new interactions between the Standard Model (SM) photon and both the dark photon ($\gamma_D)$ and an ALP ($a$) are described by the dark axion portal operator. The implications of this dark axion portal scenario for electron fixed-target experiments are presented. In particular, we investigate the missing energy signatures associated with production of dark photons and their subsequent invisible decays into stable dark sector fermions, $\gamma_D \to \chi \bar{\chi}$. We discuss the discovery potential for such a scenario and derive projected sensitivity curves for the NA64$e$ and LDMX experiments. Furthermore, novel constraints of the NA64$e$ for $9.37\times 10^{11}$ electrons on target are derived by considering two production mechanisms for invisible states: (i)~the bremsstrahlung-like emission of an $a\gamma_D$ pair, $e N \to e N \gamma^* (\to a \gamma_D)$, and (ii)~the exclusive vector meson photoproduction, $\gamma^* N \to N V$, followed by the invisible decays of vector mesons, $V \to a \gamma_D$. Additionally, the constraints on the parameter space of $CP$-violating, fermion-specific ALP and dark photon couplings are established. These constraints are derived from current experimental bounds on the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of SM fermions, incorporating loop-induced contributions to the EDMs of the electron, muon, and neutron.</description>

      <title>A study of charged-particle multiplicity distribution in high energy p-O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the multiplicity distribution of charged particles generated in $p$-O collisions, employing Pythia (Angantyr) and $k_T$-factorization approach. Oxygen nucleus configurations are sampled using a $\alpha$-cluster model to evaluate both formalisms and assess how initial nucleus configuration influences the properties of the produced final states. Results obtained through clustering are systematically compared to those derived from the Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution. The analysis encompasses various pseudorapidity intervals ($|\eta|&lt;$ 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0) and center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}=$ 2.36, 5.02, 7.0, 13.0 TeV). Based on the resulting distributions, we examine the KNO scaling effect and fit the distributions with the double NBD model for parameterization, aiming to accurately characterize the observed results and elucidate contributions from both soft and semi-hard processes. Our results indicate that different geometric descriptions of the oxygen nucleus project significantly different multiplicities of charged particles, especially for large multiplicities and higher pseudorapidity. We also observed that multiplicity of charged particles calculated with Pythia reveals significantly different behavior from that calculated with $k_T$-factorization.</description>

      <title>The absence of global anomalies of CP symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some solutions to the strong CP problem assume that CP symmetry is a gauge symmetry, which is then spontaneously broken. For this scenario to be possible, the CP symmetry should not have any nonperturbative (global) anomalies. In this paper, we study anomalies of CP symmetry of fermions which are coupled to gravity and gauge fields with a gauge group $G$. When $G$ is connected and simply connected, we show that gauging a CP symmetry does not produce any new anomaly beyond the one before gauging it. In particular, the standard model matter content does not have anomalies.</description>

      <title>Triple Differential Heavy-to-light Semi-leptonic Decays at Next-to-Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first complete calculation of the five heavy-to-light hadronic structure functions underlying semi-leptonic heavy-quark decays at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$) in perturbative QCD. This theoretical advance, achieved via an innovative hybrid computational strategy, enables precision predictions for triple differential decay rates. The results are essential for harnessing the potential of high-precision experiments at Belle II, BES III, and LHCb. Selected applications of this work include a state-of-the-art prediction for the inclusive $B \to X_u \ell \nu$ width, crucial for a percent-level determination of $|V_{ub}|$, and the first $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ results for lepton-energy moments in charm decays, vital for extracting $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cd}|$. Our analysis also reveals significant higher-order corrections in the large-$q^2$ region of $b \to u$ transitions, offering new insights into the persistent tension between inclusive and exclusive $|V_{ub}|$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Particle Invariant Mass -- Standard Expressions and Corrections to Order $(m/E)^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collider-based particle physics, $invariant\ mass$ refers to the magnitude of the total-momentum 4-vector of a system of particles. An expression for the invariant mass of a 2-particle system is well known; it assumes that both the total energy $E$ and the transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}$ of each particle in the system greatly exceed its mass $m$. This note explores these assumptions by computing correction terms in powers of $m/E$ up to order $(m/E)^4$. The assumptions are found to be robust: not only is the leading correction quadratic in $m/E$, but also cancellations reduce its coefficient and that of the next-to-leading correction, which is of order $(m/E)^4$. Three- and four-particle systems are also treated and the generalisation to larger numbers of particles indicated. The zeroth-order expressions for these multi-particle systems are remarkably simple; they deserve to be better known.</description>

      <title>Probing mixed-state dark matter and $b \to s \mu^+\mu^-$ anomalies in a scalar-assisted baryonic gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a Standard Model extension based on a local $U(1)_B$ symmetry, where a baryon-charged scalar mediates interactions between a fermionic dark matter candidate and Standard Model quarks. In this setup, the dark matter relic abundance is shaped not only by standard annihilation channels but also by additional coannihilation processes induced by a new scalar. The presence of this mediator provides a unified link between dark sector and flavor physics, yielding distinctive phenomenological consequences. We conduct a detailed study of dark matter phenomenology, emphasizing the role of the mass splitting between the dark matter particles, and the scalar mediator in determining the efficiency of coannihilation. The parameter space is examined in light of existing constraints from cosmological observations, direct and indirect detection experiments, as well as the collider searches at the \texttt{LHC}. Our analysis shows that the extended scalar sector opens up viable regions of parameter space beyond those accessible in minimal \(U(1)_B\) realizations, many of which are expected to be tested by forthcoming searches at \texttt{XENONnT} and \texttt{CTA}. Moreover, the model induces correlated signatures from flavor observables associated with the $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions as well, serving as complementary tests of the underlying framework.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Soffer Bound: Positivity Constraints on Parton Distributions of Spin-3/2 Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the complete set of positivity bounds for the leading-twist parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a spin-3/2 hadron for the first time. This work generalizes the Soffer bound, a fundamental constraint for spin-1/2 nucleons, to quark and gluon distribution functions in higher-spin systems. Expressing the antiparton-hadron scattering amplitudes in terms of the PDFs and the spin density matrix, we establish the connections between the PDFs and the scattering amplitudes in the tensor product space of the parton and hadron spins. Moreover, we obtain the definitions of the PDFs in terms of the helicity amplitudes. Positive definiteness of the scattering amplitude matrix yields a set of inequalities that define the physically allowed parameter space for the helicity amplitudes and a set of constraints for the PDFs.</description>

      <title>Associated Production of Charmonia-Bottomonia with Color-Octet Channels at the Z Factory, CEPC and FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework, we investigate the associated production of charmonia+bottomonia at future super $Z$ factory and at the CEPC/FCC-ee. The color-octet(CO) channels in the $\gamma^*/Z^0$-propagated process are considered besides the color-singlet(CS) channels. We find that the contributions of the CO states to the total cross section are dominant for almost all processes from the production threshold to the $Z^0$ mass. Thus, the comparison between the theoretical results and future data may give constraints to the CO matrix elements. In addition, we calculate the relativistic corrections to both the CS and CO channels, which decrease the cross sections significantly, with the $K$ factor $\simeq0.5$. The predicted events of ($J/\psi+\Upsilon$, $\Upsilon+\eta_c$) production, with $J/\psi, \Upsilon$ reconstructed by lepton pair and $\eta_c$ reconstructed by hadronic decays, are (1,1) and (13,10) at the CEPC(2-yr) and FCC-ee(4-yr), respectively.</description>

      <title>QCD matter at a finite magnetic field and nonzero chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid equation of state (EoS) by smoothly interpolating the EoS in the hadron resonance gas at low temperatures to that in the ideal parton gas at high temperatures, and employ it to study the properties of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter at a finite magnetic field and nonzero chemical potential. We find that dimensionless observables such as the entropy density $s/T^3$, the pressure $P/T^4$, the energy density $\varepsilon/T^4$, the trace anomaly $\Delta = (\varepsilon - 3P)/T^4$, and the specific heat at constant volume $C_V/T^3$ are sensitive to both finite magnetic field and chemical potential. As the chemical potential increases from zero, these quantities rise in both the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. In contrast, introducing a magnetic field suppresses them at low temperatures but enhances them at high temperatures. Furthermore, nonzero chemical potential and magnetic field introduce nontrivial modifications to the squared speed of sound $c_s^2$. Both effects increase $c_s^2$ close to the critical temperature while reducing it at lower temperatures. When the chemical potential and magnetic field are present simultaneously, their influences superimpose, leading to more intricate changes in the thermodynamic behavior. Finally, we compare our results with the lattice QCD data for the quadratic fluctuations of conserved charges and their correlations. The model successfully reproduces the temperature dependence of these observables at $eB=0$ and 0.04 GeV$^2$. However, at the stronger field strength $eB=0.14$ GeV$^2$, the model underestimates the magnitudes while still capturing the overall temperature trend.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of $[cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]$ tetraquarks: Nature of $D^*_{s0}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$ and $T^*_{c\bar s0}(2900)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of exotic open-charm tetraquark candidates \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\) and \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{0}\), we systematically calculate the mass spectra of \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) tetraquarks within a nonrelativistic constituent quark potential model. In the model, the tetraquark states are treated as diquark-antidiquark bound systems with an interior interaction similar to the quark-antiquark interaction in conventional mesons. The well established states \(D_{s0}^*(2317)\) with \(J^P=0^+\) and \(D_{s1}(2460)\) with \(J^P=1^+\) could be identified as the two ground states of the \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) system. \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{0}\) and \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\) could be naturally interpreted as radially excited \(0^+\) tetraquark states with different interior components. Their large mass difference may result from their different interior structure instead of an isospin symmetry breaking. Whether \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{0}\) and \(T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\) belong to an isospin triplet deserves further experimental investigation. In addition, there may be another \(0^+\) \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) tetraquark state with mass around $2450$ MeV, which is composed of a $cq$ diquark and a $\bar s\bar q$ antidiquark both with spin-0. In the energy region $2640-2700$ MeV, there may be a $J^P=2^+$ \([cq][\bar{s}\bar{q}]\) tetraquark state composed of the $cq$ diquark and the $\bar s\bar q$ antidiquark both with spin-1.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in a magnetic field with baryon and isospin chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, we present the phase diagram of low-energy QCD in a magnetic field at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. The phase diagram consists of the QCD vacuum, the chiral soliton lattice, the uniform charged pion condensation, an Abrikosov vortex lattice of the charged pions, a baryonic vortex lattice composed of neutral and charged pion vortices with their topological linking number being the baryon number, and a hybrid phase of chiral soliton and vortex lattices, with their intersections carrying the baryon number. While the chiral soliton lattice demands ultra-strong magnetic field $\sim 10^{19}$ G,the intersection phase appears at $\sim10^{17}$ G, which is more realistic in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Heavy-to-light Structure Functions at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ perturbative QCD corrections to all five heavy-to-light structure functions underlying the triple-differential semi-leptonic decay rates of heavy quarks. This is achieved via a hybrid computational strategy that combines an efficient linear interpolation (with a suitable function basis) based on stratified Gauss-Kronrod points in the leptonic-mass $q^2$ with the differential equations in the other variable, further armed with reduced numerical $\varepsilon$-dependence. Among the selected applications, we highlight the state-of-the-art prediction $\Gamma(B \rightarrow X_u \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}) = \frac{|V_{ub}|^2}{|3.82\times 10^{-3}|^2}\,\big( 6.53 \,\pm 0.12 \, \pm 0.13\, \pm 0.03\, \big) \times 10^{-16}\,\text{GeV}\,$ derived in the kinetic-mass scheme. We report several notable observations regarding the convergence of the first three orders of QCD corrections to the $q^2$-spectrum and to inclusive moments of the lepton-energy spectrum in semi-leptonic weak decays of $b$- and $c$-quark in different quark-mass schemes; they are important both for improving the inclusive determinations of the relevant CKM elements, non-perturbative dynamical parameters, and for gaining new insights into the potential impact of high-order QCD corrections. Lastly we discuss a novel interesting point encountered in the consistent perturbative reformulation of the differential $q^2$-spectrum from the pole-mass to other mass schemes: certain boundary-effect terms are identified that are non-vanishing for $b \rightarrow u \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ firstly at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$; their incorporation is essential to preserve the integrity of the integrated moments of the perturbatively re-expanded $q^2$-spectrum but necessitates histogramming from $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ onward even within pure perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Full Three-Loop Electroweak Multiplet Contributions to the Electron Electric Dipole Moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental sensitivity to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron has improved remarkably in recent years. Consequently, future prospects could probe new physics whose contribution to the electron EDM first arises at three-loop order. Additional SU(2)$_L$ multiplets with CP-violating Yukawa interactions, which contribute to the electron EDM at three-loop level, is one such testable new physics scenario. In this scenario, the electron EDM is radiatively induced from two contributions: the CP-odd trilinear $W$-boson coupling, called the electroweak-Weinberg operator, and the CP-odd dipole operator of electron. The former and the latter operators are generated at two-loop and three-loop levels, respectively, after integrating out the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. Within the same models, according to an analysis based on the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we previously found that the contribution to the electron EDM from the electroweak-Weinberg operator can be probed in future experiments. However, the one-loop matching condition between the electron EDM and the electroweak-Weinberg operator does not receive a large logarithmic enhancement because the associated anomalous dimension is zero. The CP-odd dipole operator of the electron would contribute to the electron EDM at the same three-loop order as the contribution through the electroweak-Weinberg operator. In this paper, we directly calculate the electron EDM induced by the CP-violating Yukawa interactions of the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets at full three-loop level. A central result is that the full three-loop calculation is a factor of three larger than that of the electroweak-Weinberg operator alone.</description>

      <title>Recent progress in decays of $b$ and $c$ hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last ten years there has been great progress in calculations of decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons, and baryons containing a heavy $b$ or $c$ quark. One propelling factor has been the measurement of several anomalies in $b\to s$ and $b\to c$ transitions, these are one of the only signs of physics beyond the Standard Model. The deviations included measurements of branching ratios, angular observables and lepton universality ratios. Another factor is the exclusive-inclusive discrepancy in the determination of the CKM elements $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$. We will first review recent calculations involving $b\to s$ and $c\to u$ transitions that could shed light on the neutral current anomalies. We will then summarise the progress the determination of the CKM elements, $V_{ub}$ and $V_{cb}$. Finally we will discuss the current theoretical status and experimental prospects for the lepton universality ratios in $b\to s$ and $b\to c$ semileptonic decays.</description>

      <title>Existence of the $DD^*\bar{K}^*$ and $BB^*K^*$ three-body molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of the three-body molecular state composed of $DD^*\bar{K}^*$ within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. A major challenge is that while the pseudoscalar-meson couplings are well-determined, the couplings for scalar- and vector-meson exchanges render significant model dependence. To ensure the reliability of our predictions and reduce model dependence, we recalibrate the coupling constants of the OBE model. We treat the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$, or equivalently the scalar $\sigma$-exchange coupling constant, as the only unknown parameter. The coupling constants for the vector $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchanges are determined by the pole positions of the well established states $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. We demonstrate that these parameter sets also successfully describe the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ without further tuning. For the three-body system, our results indicate that an $I\left(J^P\right)=1 / 2\left(0^{-}\right)$ three-body molecular bound state exists when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state located within approximately $-10~\text{MeV}$ of the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the complex energy plane using the complex scaling method to search for molecular resonances, though no evidence of resonances is found in considered channels. We also apply this formalism to the bottom analog $BB^*K^*$ system. In this sector, the conditions for the existence of a three-body bound state are more relaxed, as a $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state located within $-25~\text{MeV}$ below the threshold suffices, although three-body molecular resonances remain absent. We suggest that future experiments precisely measure the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$ or search for the three-body bound state in $DD\bar{K}\pi\pi$ and $DD\bar{K}$ channels, as these efforts would mutually illuminate the nature of the associated states.</description>

      <title>Studies of low energy $l+p\to l+p+\gamma$ process in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a tree-level calculation of the scattering amplitude for the $lp\to lp\gamma$ (with a hard photon) process within the framework of Chiral Perturbation Theory. Our calculations, based on the $O(p^2)$ and $O(p^3)$ nucleon-pion Lagrangians, aim to provide a theoretical prediction for the differential cross-section. The result shows that explicit inclusion of the nonzero lepton mass significantly influences the low energy differential cross section for $\mu p\to \mu p \gamma$ process. The kinematic region of the present experimental data is beyond the validity domain of the $\chi$PT and is therefore not suitable for determining the low-energy constants (LECs). By comparing our results with future experimental data, we expect to determine the values of the LECs as a further test of $\chi$PT as an effective low-energy theory of QCD. The process is of significant interest as it can help to determine the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Resonating group method for baryon-baryon interactions with unequal oscillator frequencies and its application to the $N\Delta$ system in a chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonating group method (RGM) is widely used to investigate baryon-baryon interactions at the quark level, typically under the assumption that the two baryons involved share an identical harmonic-oscillator frequency. In reality, however, when a specific interaction Hamiltonian is given, different baryons should have unequal oscillator frequencies due to distinct interaction potentials induced by their different quantum numbers. In this work, we develop a new quark-level RGM formalism for baryon-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies, with the aim of describing both single baryons and baryon-baryon interactions in a consistent framework. We present the formalism for solving bound-state and scattering problems, with particular emphasis on constructing the wave functions of two-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies. The proposed formalism is then applied to the $N\Delta$ system within a chiral SU(3) quark model, where the quark-quark interaction includes, in addition to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) and a phenomenological confinement potential, the nonet scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(3) symmetry. The distinctive features of the newly developed formalism are elucidated by comparing the results from the new formulation with those from traditional calculations.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Kaluza-Klein Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Universal Extra Dimension (UED) scenarios, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) particle is naturally stable due to a remnant discrete symmetry, KK parity, arising from extra-dimensional compactification. This stability requires no ad hoc symmetry and renders Kaluza-Klein dark matter a well-motivated candidate, provided it reproduces the observed relic abundance. The minimal UED (mUED) framework being highly predictive is strongly constrained by the combined requirements of relic density and collider searches under standard cosmological assumptions. We revisit the dark matter phenomenology of mUED in the presence of a nonstandard cosmological history featuring a low reheating temperature driven by prolonged inflaton decay. Solving the coupled Boltzmann equations for dark matter, radiation, and inflaton energy densities, we show that entropy injection during reheating can dilute the relic abundance by orders of magnitude, reopening large regions of parameter space previously ruled out. We further demonstrate that the revived parameter space is consistent with current collider, direct-detection, and indirect-detection constraints, while remaining testable by upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Time-Structured Tail Probabilities for Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Hadron Discrimination in Water-Cherenkov Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-hadron discrimination based on shower observables is essential for identifying gamma-ray astrophysical sources at the highest energies. In this work, we introduce $P^{\alpha, T}_{\rm tail}$, a new discrimination variable for ultra-high-energy photon searches within the framework of a water-Cherenkov detector (WCD) array. The observable extends signal-integrated methods by incorporating the time structure of WCD traces, using cumulative signal distributions.
  Using simulated proton- and gamma-induced air showers at energies around $10^{17}\,\mathrm{eV}$, we evaluate the performance of $P^{\alpha, T}_{\rm tail}$ and compare it with established WCD-based observables such as $S_b$, risetime-based variables, and the SWGO-inspired, $P^\alpha_{\rm tail}$. The new variable attains a background contamination of roughly $2 \times 10^{-2}$ at $50\%$ gamma efficiency, improving upon existing WCD-only methods by nearly a factor of five and approaching the performance of an idealized muon-isolating reference. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting time-resolved signal tails to enhance ultra-high-energy photon searches in sparse surface arrays.</description>

      <title>Systematic Operator Construction for Non-relativistic Effective Field Theories: Hilbert Series versus Young Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a systematic framework for operator construction in the non-relativistic effective field theory, incorporating both the three dimensional Euclidean symmetry and the internal symmetries. By employing double cover of the rotation group, we extend the Hilbert series to the non-relativistic systems, and eliminates redundancies introduced by the spin operator. We also generalize the Young tensor method to the non-relativistic cases through the $SU(2)$ semi-standard Young tableaux, which allows for the construction of operator bases with repeated fields at any given mass dimension. Utilizing the Young tensor technique and Hibert series as cross-check, we obtain the complete operator bases for the following cases: heavy particle (and also heavy quark) effective theory operators up to mass dimension 9; pion-less effective theory operators, including nucleon-nucleon contact interactions up to $\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$ and three-nucleon interactions at $\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$; and finally the spin-1/2 dark matter-nucleon operators up to $\mathcal{O}(v^4)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a background rotation significantly catalyzes the chiral magnetovortical instability in chiral magnetohydrodynamics. The rotation splits the linearly polarized Alfven wave into two circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves, one of which exhibits a lower frequency than the original Alfven wave. We find that this low-frequency magneto-Coriolis wave is always unstable in the presence of even a weak chiral vortical effect. This instability may enable new dynamo mechanism applicable to various rotating chiral plasmas.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Parton Distribution Functions from Boosted Correlations in the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \times L_t=48^3\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_\pi=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the stochastic formalism including non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate stochastic dynamics in cosmology by solving Langevin equations for Infrared (IR) modes with stochastic noises generated by Ultraviolet (UV) modes at the coarse-graining scale. By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=\lambda\phi^4$ and $V=\mu\phi\chi + \lambda\phi^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>GR from RG: Gravity Is Induced From Renormalization Group Flow In The Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this essay and utilizing the holographic Renormalization Group (RG) flow, we demonstrate how the effective action of a non-gravitating quantum field theory in the ultraviolet (UV) develops an Einstein-Hilbert term in the infrared (IR). That is, gravity is induced by the RG flow. An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Connection Between Cosmological And Planck Scales: The Barrow-Tsallis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of quantum gravity is to understand how the microscopic degrees of freedom of the cosmological horizon shape the evolution of the Universe. One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of strange and multi-strange hadrons in isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a systematic measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of $K_{s}^{0}$, $\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$, $\phi$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\overline{\Xi}^{+}$, and $\Omega^{-}$+$\overline{\Omega}^{+}$ at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt; 1.0$) for isobar, $^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr, collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependence of $v_{2}$ is studied for various centrality classes. The number of constituent quark scaling of (multi-)strange hadrons is found to hold approximately within 20%, suggesting the development of partonic collectivity in isobar collisions similar to that observed in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The average $v_{2}$ ratio shows $\sim$2% deviation from unity in central and mid-central collisions for strange hadrons, indicating a difference in nuclear structure and deformation between the isobars. The $v_{2}$ in isobaric collisions is compared to Cu+Cu, Au+Au, and U+U collisions at similar collision energies. We observe an increase in $v_{2}(p_\mathrm{T})$ with increasing system size. The difference in $v_{2}$ between the isobar and other collision systems increases with $p_\mathrm{T}$. The results are compared with a multi-phase transport model calculations with a deformed density profile to provide further insight into the nuclear structure of these isobars.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Trapped by Ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violent cosmic events, from black hole mergers to stellar collapses, often leave behind highly excited black hole remnants that inevitably relax to equilibrium. The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.</description>

Abstract: Single-minus tree-level $n$-gluon scattering amplitudes are reconsidered. Often presumed to vanish, they are shown here to be nonvanishing for certain "half-collinear" configurations existing in Klein space or for complexified momenta. We derive a piecewise-constant closed-form expression for the decay of a single minus-helicity gluon into $n-1$ plus-helicity gluons as a function of their momenta. This formula nontrivially satisfies multiple consistency conditions including Weinberg's soft theorem.</description>

      <title>Extending the Cosmological Collider: New Scaling Regimes and Constraints from BOSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields during inflation offers a compelling observational target. Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity.</description>

Abstract: The collapse of large-amplitude primordial curvature perturbations into planetary-mass primordial black holes generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave background in the $\mu $Hz frequency range that may be detectable by future Lunar Laser Ranging and Satellite Laser Ranging data. We derive projected constraints on the primordial black hole population from a null detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by these experiments, including the impact of the electroweak phase transition on the abundance of planetary-mass primordial black holes. We also discuss the connection between the obtained projected constraints and the recent microlensing observations by the HSC collaboration of the Andromeda Galaxy.</description>

      <title>An EFT approach to baryon number violation: lower limits on the new physics scale and correlations between nucleon decay modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon number is an accidental symmetry of the Standard Model at the Lagrangian level. Its violation is arguably one of the most compelling phenomena predicted by physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, there is a large experimental effort to search for it including the Hyper-K, DUNE, JUNO, and THEIA experiments. Therefore, an agnostic, model-independent, analysis of baryon number violation using the power of Effective Field Theory is very timely. In particular, in this work we study the contribution of dimension six and seven effective operators to $|\Delta (B-L)|=0, \, 2$ nucleon decays taking into account the effects of Renormalisation Group Evolution. We obtain lower limits on the energy scale of each operator and study the correlations between different decay modes. We find that for some operators the effect of running is very significant.</description>

      <title>Indications for new scalar resonances at the LHC and a possible interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last few years, the CMS and ATLAS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have reported excesses that could hint at several new scalar resonances. Although none of them has touched the discovery level, at least two of them, at about 95 GeV and 650 GeV, have been indicated by more than one experiments, and have reached statistical significance worthy of a serious investigation. Conservatively using only the numbers given by the experimental collaborations, we find combined global significances around 3$\sigma$ and 4$\sigma$ respectively for the 95~GeV and 650~GeV putative resonances. There are some more, like the one at 320 GeV, which have also been hinted at. We show that the data on only the 650 GeV resonance, assuming they stand the test of time, predict the existence of a doubly-charged scalar, and make the more common extensions of the scalar sector like those by gauge singlet scalars, the 2-Higgs doublet models or the Georgi-Machacek model, highly disfavored. We provide the readers with a minimalistic model that may possibly explain all the indications. Such a model can also accommodate the hints of a singly charged scalar at about 375 GeV, and a doubly charged scalar at about 450 GeV, as found by both the major LHC Collaborations, the combined global significance for each of them being above $2.5\sigma$. We show that even the scant data, with large error bars, have the potential to strongly constrain our model containing four scalar multiplets, which makes the model easily testable and falsifiable. Our analysis comes with the obvious caveat that the allowed parameter space that we find depends on the available data on all the new resonances, and may change in future. One may also note that this is an exploratory exercise that illustrates the difficulties when it comes to fitting several resonances simultaneously, even for next-to-minimal extensions of the SM.</description>

Abstract: In this analysis, we examine the angular distribution of low-mass dimuon pairs produced in simulated electron-positron collisions at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC), which operates at a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV and has an integrated luminosity of 4 ab\(^{-1}\). Our focus is on the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) variable, which is defined in the Collins-Soper frame. In the Standard Model, the production of low-mass dimuon pairs is primarily driven by the Drell-Yan process, which exhibits a notable forward-backward asymmetry. However, many scenarios beyond the Standard Model predict different shapes for the cos\(\theta_{\text{CS}}\) distribution. This angular distribution can be valuable for distinguishing between these models, especially in the event of observing excesses beyond the Standard Model expectations. We utilized the mono-Z\(^{\prime}\) model to interpret the simulated data. In the absence of any discoveries of new physics, we establish upper limits at the 95\% confidence level on the masses of various particles in the model, which includes the spin-1 \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and fermionic dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of Majorana fermionic dark matter (DM) via the Higgs portal, considering both freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms during and after the post-inflationary reheating phase. We assume that the Universe is reheated through the decay of the inflaton ($\phi$) into a pair of fermions $f$ and $\bar f$ via the interaction $y\,\phi\,\bar f\,f$, where $y$ is the dimensionless Yukawa coupling. Our analysis focuses on how the non-standard evolution of the Hubble expansion rate and the thermal bath temperature during reheating influence DM production. Additionally, we examine the impact of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), distinguishing between scenarios where DM freeze-in or freeze-out occurs before or after EWSB. We further explore the viable DM parameter space and its compatibility with current and future detection experiments, including XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XLZD, and collider searches. Moreover, we incorporate constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound to ensure consistency with small-scale structure formation.</description>

While the importance of initial phase-space distributions is well-established, a general instability criterion for distributions dependent on both energy and emission angle has been lacking.

      <description>arXiv:2506.02176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPT) are ubiquitous in beyond the Standard Model physics and leave distinctive echoes in the history of early universe. We consider a FOPT serving the well-motivated role of dark matter mass generation and present {\it blast-frozen dark matter} (BFDM), which transitions from radiation to non-relativistic relic in a period much shorter than the corresponding Hubble time. Its cosmological imprint are strong oscillations in the dark matter density perturbations that seed structure formation on large and small scales. For a FOPT occurring not long before the matter-radiation equality, next generation cosmological surveys bear a strong potential to discover BFDM and in turn establish the origin of dark matter mass.</description>

Abstract: A deeper understanding of QCD matter at strong coupling remains challenging due to its non-perturbative nature. To this end, we study a two-flavor holographic hard-wall model to investigate the properties of QCD at finite-density and zero temperature with a nonvanishing quark mass. A dense matter phase is described by a classical solution of the equations of motion in a homogeneous Ansatz. We apply holographic renormalization to formulate the holographic dictionary that relates UV boundary data in the bulk with the physical quantities in QCD. We emphasize a role played by an IR boundary action on the hard-wall when analyzing the QCD phase structures in this holographic setup. It is found that a baryonic matter phase is manifested in this model with a high baryon number density and a nearly vanishing chiral condensate. We derive the equation of state for the resulting phase and use it to work out the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. We find that the maximum mass of neutron stars can exceed two solar masses for a wide range of free parameters in this model. We also comment on an alternative scenario about the phase structure such that the baryonic matter phase arises at a baryon number chemical potential greater than a critical value.</description>

      <title>WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect</title>

Abstract: The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may exist today and be candidates for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via the Hawking radiation of PBHs, and PBHs that survived Hawking evaporation via the memory burden effect. Feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are alternatives to WIMPs. Focusing on parameter regions where thermal production dominates and PBHs never dominate the energy density of the Universe, we identify a sufficient condition under which DM particles emitted from PBHs do not thermalize with the thermal bath. In this regime, the total DM relic abundance can be consistently obtained as the sum of the three components. In addition, we show that the contribution from gravitational freeze-in via graviton exchange remains subdominant within the parameter space considered.</description>

      <title>Rephasing Invariant Formula for CP Phase in Kobayashi-Maskawa Parametrization and Exact Sum Rule with Unitarity Triangle $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we obtain a rephasing invariant formula for the CP phase in the Kobayashi--Maskawa parameterization $\delta_{\rm KM} = \arg [ - { V_{ud} \det V_{\rm CKM} / V_{us} V_{ub} V_{cd} V_{td}} ]$. General perturbative expansion of the formula and observed value $\delta_{\rm KM} \simeq \pi/2$ reveal that the phase difference of the 1-2 mixings $e^{i (\rho_{12}^{d} - \rho_{12}^{u})}$ is close to maximal for sufficiently small 1-3 quark mixings $s_{13}^{u,d}$. Moreover, combining this result with another formula for the CP phase $\delta_{\rm PDG}$ in the PDG parameterization, we derived an exact sum rule $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$ which relating the phases and the angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ of the unitarity triangle.</description>

      <title>Diffractive vector meson photo-production in oxygen--oxygen and neon--neon ultraperipheral collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy-dependent hotspot model is used to predict cross sections for vector-meson diffractive photo-nuclear production off oxygen ($\gamma$O) and neon ($\gamma$Ne) that can be extracted from ultra-peripheral O--O and Ne--Ne collisions, recently recorded at the LHC. In both cases, two models are used to describe the nuclear shapes. Woods-Saxon prescriptions for O and Ne as well as an alpha-cluster description of O and a bowling-pin-like shape for Ne, according to the PGCM formalism. Predictions are presented for the dependence on the centre-of-mass energy of the photon--nucleus system, as well as on Mandelstam-$t$, of the cross sections for the coherent and the incoherent photo-nuclear production of $\rho^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ vector mesons. Furthermore, the rapidity dependence of the ultra-peripheral cross section is reported for all cases. It is found that the incoherent process provides a measurable signature for the approach to the gluon-saturation regime, and that the simultaneous determination of $\rho^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ coherent and incoherent production provides a strong constraint on nuclear models for both O and Ne.</description>

      <title>Studies of beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV within a transport model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy proton proton ($pp$) collisions at the LHC, non-prompt charm hadrons, originating from beauty hadron decays, provide a valuable probe for beauty quark dynamics, particularly at low transverse momentum where direct beauty measurements are challenging. We employ A Multi-Phase Transport Model (AMPT) of string melting version coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions to study the beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron productions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. In this work, the beauty quark mass during the generation stage has been increased to reproduce the measured $b\bar{b}$ cross section, and a beauty flavor specific coalescence parameter $r_{BM}^b$ is introduced to match LHCb measurements of beauty baryon to meson ratios. With these refinements, AMPT achieves a reasonable agreement with experimental data on beauty hadron yields and non-prompt charm hadron production from ALICE and LHCb. We present the transverse momentum and multiplicity dependence of non-prompt to prompt charm hadron ratios, providing new insights into the interplay between beauty quark production and hadronization process. We emphasize that the multiplicity dependence of the non-prompt to prompt charm hadron productions can be useful to constrain the flavor dependences of the coalescence dynamics. This work establishes a unified framework for future studies of heavy quark transport and collective flow behavior in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Holomorphic $A_4$ Modular Symmetry in Type-I Seesaw: Implications for Neutrino Masses and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos, governed by a non-holomorphic $A_{4}$ modular flavor symmetry. Within this model framework, the light neutrino masses are generated via the popular type-I seesaw mechanism in which the structure of the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings is decided by nonholomorphic modular forms. Unlike conventional flavor models with ad hoc flavon fields, the structure of Dirac and Majorana mass matrices is entirely determined by a modulus parameter $\tau$. We construct the predictive mass matrices for charged leptons, Dirac neutrinos, and right-handed Majorana neutrinos and show the compatibility with neutrino oscillation data by an appropriate choice of input model parameters. We present numerical analysis of two sets of benchmark points explaining neutrino masses while generating the correct amount of baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. We estimate numerically the values of CP-asymmetry and examine the evolution of the lepton asymmetry by studying Boltzman equations by considering both strong and washout regimes with CP-asymmetry parameter in the range $|\varepsilon_{1}| \sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-8}$. The model predicts an effective Majorana mass in the few meV range, below current experimental bounds but within reach of next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. The key feature of non-holomorphic $A_4$ modular symmetry naturally accommodates non-zero neutrino masses and mixings, minimizes the Yukawa arbitrariness, and establishes a direct connection between high-scale leptogenesis with low-energy neutrino observable parameters, thereby the model provides a testable link between neutrino flavor physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Subleading Effects in Soft-Gluon Emission at One-Loop in Massive QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the last missing ingredient necessary to approximate one-loop amplitudes in QCD with massive quarks in the limit of vanishing energy of a single gluon up to terms suppressed by this energy. Our main result is a soft operator acting in color and spin space that manipulates the momenta of the hard partons while keeping them on-shell and respecting momentum conservation. Additionally, we provide a complete expression for the subleading term of the expansion of an arbitrary tree-level amplitude in the limit where the momenta of a massless quark and a massless anti-quark of the same flavor become collinear. This limit is necessary to obtain the one-loop soft approximation whenever the process involves such a quark-anti-quark pair. Interestingly, the result involves a high-energy limit.</description>

      <title>Decay and production properties of strange double charm pentaquark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the decay and production properties of the strange double-charm pentaquark $P_{ccs}^{++}$ with strangeness $S=-1$. Building upon our previous work predicting its $J^P=1/2^-$ molecular configuration, we employ three-point QCD sum rules to calculate its strong decay widths and estimate its production branching ratio via $\Xi_{bc}^+$ baryon decays. The total strong decay width to the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ and $\Omega_{cc}\pi$ final-state channels is determined as $85\pm19$ MeV. Furthermore, using a rescattering mechanism, we analyze the $\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D_s^{\ast-}\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++}$ process and estimate the production branching ratio to be $\mathcal{B}r(\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++})=(4.3_{-1.5}^{+2.0})\times10^{-6}$. The relatively narrow width and detectable branching ratio suggest the possibility searching for this pentaquark state in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of multiple light axions in the infrared is a generic feature of many ultraviolet (UV) scenarios. In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.</description>

      <title>Revealing dipion correlations for the observed substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold in $\psi(3686)\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10345v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the world's largest $\psi(3686)$ data sample, the BESIII Collaboration recently reported a substructure near the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass threshold in the decay $\psi(3686) \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$, challenging the established understanding of the dipion invariant mass spectrum. We propose that this substructure arises directly from dipion correlations. Using a chiral unitary approach, we successfully reproduce the observed anomaly, thereby providing strong evidence of dipion correlation in heavy quarkonium decays. This approach also allows us to predict the corresponding dipion correlation function.</description>

Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and the discrete symmetries of Hermiticity, time-reversal, and parity invariance. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observe differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/\alpha$, the ``saturon" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2\pi)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/\alpha_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/\alpha_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study chiral symmetry restoration in hot and dense quark matter using the von Neumann chirality entropy within the in-medium Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Starting from the lesser Green's function G&lt;(k), we construct the chirality-reduced correlator C_L = P_L G&lt;(k) P_L and define the associated entropy S_chi = -Tr[C_L ln C_L + (1 - C_L) ln(1 - C_L)] to quantify quantum entanglement between left- and right-handed quark sectors. The dynamical quark mass M_q(T, mu_q) reproduces the expected QCD-like phase structure, showing a second-order transition in the chiral limit and a smooth crossover for finite current quark mass. The chirality entropy S_chi increases monotonically with temperature and chemical potential and approaches a maximal value as M_q -&gt; 0. Analyzing its critical behavior, we find a scaling exponent beta_Schi ~ 1, distinct from that of the chiral order parameter. This indicates that S_chi is not an order parameter but a thermodynamic measure of chiral quantum decoherence. Our results demonstrate that chiral symmetry restoration and chiral decoherence are not identical phenomena, and that the chirality entropy reveals information inaccessible to conventional symmetry-breaking observables.</description>

Abstract: The proposed fixed-target experiment, MUonE, at CERN will aim to measure the hadronic contribution to the running of the QED coupling by analysing the scattering of muons on electrons. Here we present state-of-the-art predictions for the process $\mu^{\pm}e^-\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}e^-$, where for the first time an all-order resummation of soft and soft-collinear logarithms has been performed. Further, we match this resummation with the complete next-to-leading and the dominant next-to-next-to-leading higher-order corrections. We find that the resummation has a dominant effect in the signal region, while the systematic matching significantly reduces the perturbative uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: We report new constraints on the parameters of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity, derived from its imprints on neutrino flavor oscillations. Our analysis reveals that the presence of spacetime torsion can alter both vacuum oscillations and the matter enhanced Mikheyev Smirnov Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance. By using data from solar neutrino experiments: Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, and KamLAND, we perform a combined analysis to place the first direct observational bounds on the neutrino-torsion coupling and $f(T)$ parameters. These results establish neutrino phenomenology as a novel astrophysical probe for testing fundamental modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>Axions on a Hyperbolic Ride: Geometric Suppression of CMB Isocurvature and a Blue-Tilted Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMB limits on cold-dark-matter isocurvature are often interpreted as excluding the simultaneous realization of high-scale inflation and large QCD axion decay constants in pre-inflationary Peccei--Quinn (PQ) scenarios. We show that this conclusion can be evaded by exploiting \emph{field-space geometry}. For a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and a nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term $d\sigma^{2}=dR^{2}+f^{2}(R)\,d\theta^{2}$, the observable axion fluctuation is $\delta\theta\sim H_{\rm inf}/f(R)$, so an enhanced effective decay constant $f(R)$ suppresses isocurvature without explicit PQ breaking, extreme radial displacements, or additional couplings. Specializing to a hyperbolic metric $f(R)\propto \sinh(R/L)$ with curvature scale $L$, we find that for $R\gtrsim L$ the exponential geometric-factor $f(R)$ strongly suppresses CMB-scale isocurvature while producing a characteristic blue-tilted spectrum. The same geometry induces a time-dependent $\mathcal{O}(H_{\rm inf})$ effective mass for the canonical axial mode even during radial slow-roll, which controls the scale-dependence of isocurvature. As a result, inflationary Hubble scales as large as $H_{\rm inf}\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ can be compatible with $f_a\sim 10^{14}$--$10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, reopening parameter space usually regarded as excluded. We present numerical benchmarks and a semi-analytic template that relates the scale-dependence of isocurvature to the geometric lever arm $R/L$, providing a direct phenomenological probe on PQ field-space geometry.</description>

      <title>The Balitsky-Kovchegov equation for dipole gluon density in the momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present derivation the BK equation for the dipole gluon density in momentum space, starting from its standard formulation in coordinate space. I review the equation for both proton and nuclear targets, and I also discuss the resummed BK evolution.The purpose of this paper is to consolidate derivations and formulas scattered across the literature, to show in detail how the structure of the triple-Pomeron vertex emerges in the unfolded form of the nonlinear term, and to establish a consistent notation throughout.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the triplet hadrons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the non-relativistic constituent quark model. A striking prediction of our study is the giant electric polarizabilities of the $D^*$ mesons: $\alpha_E(\bar{D}^{*0}) \approx 291.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(D^{*-}) \approx -0.4-64.4 i \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$. These anomalously large values arise from the near-degenerate mass between $D^*$ and $D \pi$, which are orders of magnitude larger than those of their bottom counterparts. This kinematic coincidence induces a pronounced cusp structure in the chiral loops, reflecting the long-range dynamics of a pion cloud. For doubly heavy baryons, polarizabilities depend strongly on heavy-flavor composition: the $bcq$ system differs markedly from $ccq$ and $bbq$ due to mixing with scalar heavy-diquark states. Using heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry (HDAS), we unify the chiral dynamics of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit. The pion-loop contributions dominate the electromagnetic structure of heavy hadrons and provide essential benchmarks for future lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from UV/IR mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holography and entropy bounds suggest that the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs of gravitational effective theories are related to one another as a form of UV/IR mixing. Motivated by this, we derive a bound on the allowed scalar field range in theories with cosmic horizons. We show how this bound challenges several inflationary scenarios, such as $\alpha$-attractors and modular-invariant inflation. Besides, we find a relation between the number of extra spatial dimensions and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Constraining Super-Heavy Dark Matter with the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT collaboration detected an astrophysical neutrino event, KM3-230213A, with an energy of approximately $220~\rm PeV$, providing unprecedented insights into the ultra-high-energy Universe. In this study, we introduce a novel likelihood framework designed to leverage this event to constrain the properties of super-heavy dark matter (SHDM) decay. Our approach systematically integrates multi-messenger constraints from galactic and extragalactic neutrino flux measurements by IceCube, the absence of comparable neutrino events at IceCube and Auger observatories, and the latest gamma-ray experiment upper limits. Our findings impose the most stringent constraints to date, placing a lower bound on the SHDM lifetime at $\gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{29}-10^{30} \rm s$. Importantly, we identify, for the first time, the significant potential of galactic neutrino flux measurements in advancing dark matter research. Future investigations targeting astrophysical neutrinos originating from the Galactic Center at energies above $10~\rm PeV$ will be crucial, not only for understanding the origin of the cosmic-ray knee but also for exploring the possible contributions of super-heavy dark matter to our Universe.</description>

      <title>Charm quark evolution in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks are predominantly generated at the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions such that heavy flavor observables have the potential to provide information on the pre-equilibrium medium dynamics. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ to early-time charm quark dynamics in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We employ the IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD framework to model the evolution of the bulk medium. Charm quarks are generated using PYTHIA with nuclear parton distribution functions and evolved using Langevin dynamics within MARTINI. We observe that even though there is significant momentum broadening in the earliest stage, D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ are only weakly sensitive to pre-equilibrium interactions.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

      <title>Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</description>
