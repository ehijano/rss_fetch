      <title>Evolution of Photospheric Magnetic Field and Electric Currents during the X1.6 Flare in Active Region NOAA 12192</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetic fields in the Sun's active regions plays a key role in triggering solar eruptions. Studies have shown that changes in the photosphere's magnetic field can destabilize large-scale structure of the corona, leading to explosive events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This paper delves into the magnetic field evolution associated with a powerful X1.6 class flare that erupted on October 22nd, 2014, from the flare-rich active region NOAA 12192. We utilized high-resolution vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) to track these changes. Our analysis reveals that a brightening, a precursor to the flare, began near the newly emerged, small-scale bipolar flux regions. During the X1.6 flare, the magnetic flux in both polarities displayed emergence and cancellation. The total current within the active region peaked during the flare. But, it is a non CME event and the ratio of direct to return current value remain close to 1. The large flare in this active region occured when the net current in both polarities attain the same sign. This implies that the Lorentz force, a consequence of the interaction between currents and magnetic fields, would have pushed the field lines together in this scenario. This reconnection of opposing magnetic fields is believed to be the driving force behind major flare occurred in this active region.</description>

      <title>Automated Methods for Abundance Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the multiplexing power of spectroscopic instruments increases, so does the need for automated analysis. In practice, the bottleneck for speed is the calculation of model spectra to evaluate the likelihood of candidate parameters. This presentation gives an overview of the steps required for automating spectroscopic analyses, focusing on the speedups achievable by precomputing regular grids of synthetic spectra for on-the-fly interpolation, and a new technique based on precomputed irregular grids capable of tackling problems with much higher dimensionality, as in the case when we are interested in deriving the abundances of multiple elements. Accuracy, ease of use and portability will be discussed.</description>

      <title>A stellar evolutionary grid for binary population synthesis: from the main sequence to helium ignition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass changes due to strong stellar winds and binary mass transfer have a dramatic impact on the consequent evolution of stars. This is generally not accounted for in population synthesis codes which are built using single star evolution models from full stellar evolution codes. We produce a new grid of models using the 1D stellar evolution code \textit{MESA} which includes models with a range of core mass fractions, at each total stellar mass, evolved from core hydrogen exhaustion to the onset of core helium burning. The model grid is used to produce an interpolation table, designed for use in population synthesis codes such as \textit{binary\_c}. We test the interpolation table with a simple integration algorithm to evaluate its capability of reproducing accurate evolutionary tracks. We test our method for stellar masses in the range $M=1-16~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and show that it successfully reproduces the Hertzpsrung-gap and giant branch lifetime, the core mass at helium ignition and the HR diagram.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Validating Physics Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17894v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present generative artificial intelligence (AI) to empirically validate fundamental laws of physics, focusing on the Stefan-Boltzmann law linking stellar temperature and luminosity. Our approach simulates counterfactual luminosities under hypothetical temperature regimes for each individual star and iteratively refines the temperature-luminosity relationship in a deep learning architecture. We use Gaia DR3 data and find that, on average, temperature's effect on luminosity increases with stellar radius and decreases with absolute magnitude, consistent with theoretical predictions. By framing physics laws as causal problems, our method offers a novel, data-driven approach to refine theoretical understanding and inform evidence-based policy and practice.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Criticality Across Thirteen Orders of Magnitude in the Solar-Stellar Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed size distributions of solar and stellar flares is found to be consistent with the predictions of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which predicts power law slopes with universal constants of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux, and $\alpha_E=(5/3)\approx 1.67$ for the fluence, respectively. In this Letter we explore the solar-stellar connection under this aspect, which extends over an unprecedented dynamic range of 13 orders of magnitude between the smallest detected solar nanoflare event ($E_{min}=10^{24}$ erg) and the largest superflare ($E_{max}=10^{37}$ erg) on solar-like G-type stars, observed with the KEPLER mission. The FD-SOC model predicts a scaling law of $L \propto E^{(2/9)}$ for the length scale $L$ as a function of the flare energy $E$, which limits the largest flare size to $L_{max} \lapprox 0.14 R_\odot$ for solar flares, and $L_{stellar} \lapprox 1.04\ R_{\odot}$ for stellar flares on G-type stars. In the overall we conclude that the universality of power laws (and their slopes) is a consequence of SOC properties (fractality, classical diffusion, scale-freeness, volume-flux proportionality), rather than identical physical processes at different wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Origins of the Elements Through Galactic Archeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-metallicity stars preserve the signatures of the first stellar nucleosynthesis events in the Galaxy, as their surface abundances reflect the composition of the interstellar medium from which they were born. Aside from primordial Big Bang nucleosynthesis, massive stars, due to their short lifetimes, dominate the ejecta into the interstellar medium of the early Galaxy. Most of them will end as core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions, and typical ejected abundance distributions, e.g. in terms of the alpha-element-to-Fe ratios, reflect these contributions. Essentially all CCSNe contribute 56Fe. Therefore, low-metallicity stars can be used to test whether the abundances of any other elements are correlated with those of Fe, i.e. whether these elements have been co-produced in the progenitor sources or if they require either a different or additional astrophysical origin(s). The present analysis focuses on stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-2, as they probe the earliest formation phase of the Galaxy when only one or very few nucleosynthesis events had contributed their ejecta to the gas from which the lowest metallicity stars form. This was also the era before low and intermediate mass stars (or type Ia supernovae) could contribute any additional heavy elements. Following earlier works into the origin of heavy r-process elements [1], we extend the present study to examine Pearson and Spearman correlations of Fe with Li, Be, C, N, Na, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Zn, Ge, Se, Sr, Zr, Ba, Ce, Sm, Eu, Yb, Lu, Hf, Os, Ir, Pb, Th, and U, using high-resolution stellar abundance data from the SAGA [2] and JINA [3] databases. The main goal is to identify which of the observed elements (i) may have been co-produced with Fe in (possibly a variety of) CCSNe, and which elements require (ii) either a completely different, or (iii) at least an additional astrophysical origin.</description>

      <title>LAMOST YSOs. I. Spectroscopically identifying and characterizing M-type young stellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilized LAMOST low-resolution spectra to identify M-type YSOs and characterize their accretion signatures. We measured characteristic features, including hydrogen Balmer, Li {\sc i}, He~{\sc i}, Na {\sc i}, and Ca {\sc ii} lines, as well as molecular absorption bands such as CaH. These features were evaluated for their potential to distinguish between different classes of M-type stars. In addition to the commonly used H$\alpha$ emission and {Li \sc i} $\lambda6708$~\AA~absorption, other features such as He~{\sc i}, Na {\sc i}, Ca~{\sc ii} HK and IRT lines, and CN, CaH, and VO bands also show potential for identifying YSOs from M-type dwarfs and giants. Based on key red-band features, we identified over 8,500 M-type YSO candidates from the LAMOST DR8 archive using the random forest technique, with over 2,300 of them likely being classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). By incorporating $Gaia$ astrometry, 2MASS photometry, and extinction from 3D dust maps, we estimated the basic properties (such as age and mass) of the YSO candidates based on {\sc parsec} models. We also estimated the mass accretion rates of the CTTS candidates using H$\alpha$ emission. The derived accretion rates show a dependence on age and mass similar to that described in previous studies. Significant scatter in mass accretion rates exists even among stars with similar age and mass, which may be partly attributed to variations in $\rm H\alpha$ emission and the veiling.</description>

      <title>KMTNet View of Blue Large-amplitude Pulsators Toward the Galactic Bulge: I. Discovery of Wide-orbit Companions in OGLE-BLAP-006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs), a recently classified type of variable stars, are evolved objects likely formed through interactions between stars in a binary system. However, only two BLAPs with stellar companions have been discovered to date. This paper presents photometric data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) for three BLAPs located in the direction of the Galactic bulge: OGLE-BLAP-006, OGLE-BLAP-007, and OGLE-BLAP-009. The data were collected over eight consecutive years, beginning in 2016, with a high cadence of approximately 15 minutes. Frequency analysis of light variations revealed OGLE-BLAP-006 as a multimode pulsator with a dominant frequency of 37.88 day$^{-1}$ and two new frequencies of 38.25 and 35.05 day$^{-1}$. In contrast, OGLE-BLAP-007 and OGLE-BLAP-009 exhibit single-mode pulsation. By combining the KMTNet data with archival OGLE observations, we investigated pulsation timing variations of the BLAPs using an $O-C$ diagram to identify the light travel time effect caused by the orbital motion of their companions. We found that OGLE-BLAP-006, with no evidence of close companions, has two wide-orbit companions with orbital periods of approximately 4,700 and 6,300 days, making it the third known BLAP in a stellar system; however, no companions were found for OGLE-BLAP-007 and OGLE-BLAP-009. Furthermore, we identified seven other BLAP candidates with wide companions using OGLE data, suggesting that such systems are relatively common. We propose that a BLAP with a wide companion may be a merger remnant of an inner close binary within a hierarchical triple system.</description>

      <title>Making sense of the spectral line profiles of Betelgeuse and other Red SuperGiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetry of atomic lines in the spectra of Betelgeuse, and other Red SuperGiants (RSG), presents broad line profiles in linear polarization, but narrow profiles in intensity. Recent observations of the Red SuperGiant RW Cep show, on the other hand, broad intensity profiles, comparable to those in linear polarization. This observation hints that this difference in the Stokes Q/U and I profile widths noted in many RSG is just a temporary situation of the atmosphere of a given star. We propose an explanation for both cases based on the presence of strong velocity gradients larger than the thermal broadening of the spectral line. Using analytical but very simple radiative transfer we can compute intensity line profiles in such scenarios. We find that they qualitatively match the observed broadenings: large gradients are required for the narrow profiles of Betelgeuse, small gradients for the broad profiles of RW Cep. Profile bisectors are also reasonably well explained by this scenario in spite of the simple radiative transfer treatment. These results give a comprehensive explanation of both intensity and polarisation profiles. They provide also comfort to the approximationof a single-scattering event used in explaining the observed linear polarization in the inference of images of the photosphere of Betelgeuse and other Red SuperGiants as RW Cep, $\mu$ Cep and CE Tau.
  The atmospheres of Red SuperGiants appear to be able, perhaps cyclically, to either produce large velocity gradients that prevent photospheric plasma
  from reaching the upper atmosphere and that must hinder large events of mass loss, either to leave vertical movements unchanged, letting
  plasma raising, escaping gravity and forming large dust clouds in the circumstellar environement.
  The origin of the velocity gradient and its modulation within the atmosphere remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Brown dwarf number density in the JWST COSMOS-Web field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 $M_J$), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 $\mu$m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities $12\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, $12\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, and $17\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Convergence study of ambipolar diffusion in realistic simulations of magneto-convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to improve our understanding of the heating mechanisms of the solar chromosphere via realistic three-dimensional (3D) modeling of solar magneto-convection, considering the fact that solar plasma contains a significant fraction of neutral gas. For that we performed simulations of the same physically volume of the Sun, namely 5.76x5.76x2.3 Mm^3 (with 1.4 Mm being above the optical surface), at three different resolutions: 20x20x14, 10x10x7 and 5x5x3.5 km^3. At all three resolutions we compare the time series of simulations with/without ambipolar diffusion, as the main non-ideal heating mechanism due to neutrals. We also compare simulations with three different magnetizations: (1) case of a small-scale dynamo; (2) an initially implanted vertical magnetic field of 50 G; (3) an initially implanted vertical field of 200 G, though not all of them are available at all resolutions. We obtain that the average magnetization of the simulations increases with improving resolution. So does the average magnetic Poynting flux, meaning that there is more magnetic energy in the simulation box at higher resolutions. Ambipolar diffusion operates at relatively large scales, which can be actually numerically resolved with the grid scale of the highest resolution simulations as the ones reported here. We consider two ways of evaluating where the ambipolar scales are numerically resolved: (i) a method to evaluate the numerical diffusion of the simulations and compare it to the physical ambipolar diffusion; (ii) an order of magnitude comparison of spatial scales given by the ambipolar diffusion to our grid resolution. At the resolved locations we compare the average temperature in the simulations with/without ambipolar diffusion, and conclude that the plasma is on average about 600 K hotter after 1200 sec of simulation time when the ambipolar diffusion is included.</description>

      <title>A benchmark companion at the hydrogen-burning limit imaged in the core cluster of the Fornax-Horologium association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass stellar and substellar companions are indispensable objects for verifying evolutionary models that transition from low-mass stars to planets. Their formation is likely also affected by the surrounding stellar environment. The Fornax-Horologium (FH) association is a recently classified young association in the solar neighbourhood with a dissolving open cluster in its centre. It has not been searched widely for substellar companions and exoplanets with direct imaging. We search for companions of stars in the FH and investigate the formation and evolution of companions during the expansion and dissolution of a star cluster. We conduct a direct-imaging survey of 49 stars in FH with VLT/SPHERE. We present HD 24121B, a companion at the hydrogen-burning limit that orbits star HD 24121 in the core cluster of the FH. The companion is located at a projected angular separation of 2.082 $\pm$ 0.004 arcsec from the central star and has contrasts of $\Delta$H2 = 5.07 $\pm$ 0.05 mag and $\Delta$H3= 4.98 $\pm$ 0.05 mag. We estimate a photometric mass of 74.9 $\pm$ 7.5 $M_J$ for HD 24121B, which places it at the boundary of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. It is a new benchmark object for evolutionary models at the hydrogen-burning boundary, especially at the age of 30 - 40 Myr. Orbital fitting with joint Gaia and SPHERE relative astrometry found a high eccentricity for HD 24121B. This suggests that it may have undergone dynamic scattering. Future chemical composition measurements such as high-resolution spectroscopic observations will provide more clues on its formation history.</description>

      <title>Further evidence of saturated, boosted, and disrupted magnetic braking from evolutionary tracks of cataclysmic variables</title>

Abstract: Angular momentum loss through magnetic braking drives the spin-down of low-mass stars and the orbital evolution of various close binary systems. Current theories for magnetic braking, often calibrated for specific types of systems, predict angular momentum loss rates that differ by several orders of magnitude. A unified prescription would provide valuable constraints on the relationship between angular momentum loss, stellar dynamos, and magnetic activity. Recent studies have shown that a saturated, boosted, and disrupted (SBD) magnetic braking prescription can explain the observed increase in the fraction of close white dwarf plus M-dwarf binaries at the fully convective boundary, the period distribution of main-sequence binaries, and the mass distribution of close M-dwarf companions to hot subdwarfs. To analyze whether this prescription also applies to related binaries, we investigated the evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) using the SBD magnetic braking model. We implemented the SBD prescription into the stellar evolution code MESA and simulated CV evolution, testing different values for the boosting and disruption parameters over a range of stellar properties. Our model reproduces the observed mass transfer rates and donor mass-radius relation with good accuracy. The evolutionary tracks match the observed boundaries of the orbital period gap and the period minimum for values of boosting and disruption slightly smaller but still consistent with those derived from detached binaries. Angular momentum loss through SBD magnetic braking can explain not only detached binaries but also cataclysmic variables, making it the only current prescription suitable for multiple types of close binary stars. Further testing in other systems is needed, and the semi-empirical convective turnover times currently used for main-sequence stars should be replaced with self-consistent values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study presents an effective approach for deriving and utilizing polarity-based cross-correlation functions to forecast Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) fluxes based on solar activity proxies. By leveraging a universal correlation framework calibrated with AMS-02 and PAMELA proton flux data under a numerical model, the methodology incorporates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and a global spline fit. These techniques ensure robust handling of short-term fluctuations and smooth transitions during polarity reversals. The results have significant potential for space weather applications, enabling reliable GCR flux predictions critical for radiation risk assessments and operational planning in space exploration and satellite missions.</description>

      <title>Solar Radio Burst Detection Based on Deformable DETR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar radio bursts (SRBs) detection is crucial for solar physics research and space weather forecasting. The main challenges faced are noise interference in the spectrum and the diversity of SRBs. However, most research focuses on classifying whether SRBs exist or detecting a single type of SRBs. Existing detection models exhibit deficiencies in the accuracy of SRBs detection. Moreover, existing detection models cannot effectively handle background noise interference in solar radio spectrograms and the significant scale variations among different burst types. This paper proposes a high-performance detection model for solar radio bursts (SRBs) based on Deformable DETR (DEtection TRansformers) called DETR4SBRs. Firstly, this study designed a scale sensitive attention (SSA) module better to address the scale variations of SRBs. Subsequently, this study introduced collaborative hybrid auxiliary training to mitigate the positive-negative sample imbalance issue in Deformable DETR. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mAP@50 of 83.5% and a recall rate of 99.4% on the SRBs dataset. Additionally, the model exhibits excellent noise-robust performance and can efficiently detect and locate Type II, III, IV, and V SRBs. The model proposed in this study provides robust support for preliminary solar radio burst data processing and has significant implications for space weather forecasting. The source code and data are available on the https://github.com/onewangqianqian/SSA-Co-Deformable-DETR.git and archived on Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on Hubble Constant Measurements from Gravitational Wave Observations: A Case Study of the GW190514-GW190521 Hierarchical Triple Merger inside AGN J124942.3+344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Emulation of Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based emulators for the inference of stellar parameters and elemental abundances represent an increasingly popular methodology in modern spectroscopic surveys. However, these approaches are often constrained by their emulation precision and domain transfer capabilities. Greater generalizability has previously been achieved only with significantly larger model architectures, as demonstrated by Transformer-based models in natural language processing. This observation aligns with neural scaling laws, where model performance predictably improves with increased model size, computational resources allocated to model training, and training data volume. In this study, we demonstrate that these scaling laws also apply to Transformer-based spectral emulators in astronomy. Building upon our previous work with TransformerPayne and incorporating Maximum Update Parametrization techniques from natural language models, we provide training guidelines for scaling models to achieve optimal performance. Our results show that within the explored parameter space, clear scaling relationships emerge. These findings suggest that optimal computational resource allocation requires balanced scaling. Specifically, given a tenfold increase in training compute, achieving an optimal seven-fold reduction in mean squared error necessitates an approximately 2.5-fold increase in dataset size and a 3.8-fold increase in model size. This study establishes a foundation for developing spectral foundational models with enhanced domain transfer capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Electromagnetic Transition Radiation on Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational shockwave hits a magnetar it creates perturbations of the magnetar magnetic field in a form of a transition radiation. We argue that this radiation can be a novel candidate to explain the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB). A unique feature of the transition radiation on the shockwaves is that normal components of its Maxwell strength `remember' only the spatial `profile' of the shock, not the form of the signal. This fact allows us to determine completely a characteristic initial problem for the perturbations with Cauchy data defined on a null hypersurface just behind the shockwave front. The computations are carried by modeling magnetar as a magnetic dipole. As an illustration we consider shockwaves created by ultrarelativistic objects of two types, by compact sources or by cosmic strings. In the both cases the duration of the engine pulse is determined by an impact distance between the magnetar and the source. We present the angular distribution of the transition radiation flux and show that it is consistent with properties of the FRB engine.</description>

      <title>Accreting Binary Eccentricities follow Predicted Equilibrium Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate observations of circumbinary disks (CBD), to find evidence for an equilibrium eccentricity predicted by current binary accretion theory. Although stellar binary demographics in the Milky Way show no evidence for a preferred eccentricity for binary systems, we show that actively accreting systems lie on a predicted equilibrium eccentricity curve. We constrain our sample to only systems that have well defined orbital parameters (e.g,. eccentricity, mass-ratio, inclination angle). We find observations are consistent with theory for stellar binaries that are aligned with the disk and that are separated enough that tidal circularization is negligible. This suggests that eccentricity in these systems evolves after the dissipation of the CBD, given the flat eccentricity distribution of binary systems in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.</description>

      <title>Resonance Locking of Anharmonic $g$-Modes in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars in coalescing binaries deform due to the tidal gravitational fields generated by their companions. During the inspiral phase, the tidal deformation is dominated by the fundamental oscillation ($f$-) mode of the stars. The tide also has sub-dominant gravity ($g$-) modes that are resonantly excited when the linear tidal forcing sweeps through their eigenfrequencies. Beyond the linear order in perturbed fluid displacement, the $g$-modes are anharmonic, i.e., their oscillation frequencies depend on the mode energy. For the lowest-order $g$-mode, we show that when the tidal forcing reaches its linear eigenfrequency, the mode starts to dynamically adjust its energy so that its nonlinearly shifted oscillation frequency always matches that of the driving field. This phenomenon, which we term `resonance locking', persists through the rest of the inspiral, and hence, the mode grows to substantially larger energies than in the linear theory. Using a $1.4$--$1.4\, M_{\odot}$ binary neutron star system with the SLy4 equation of state, we find this results in an extra correction to the frequency-domain gravitational wave (GW) phase of $|\Delta \Psi|\approx 3\,{\rm rad}$ accumulated from the onset of resonance locking at the GW frequency of $94\,{\rm Hz}$ to the merger at $1.05\,{\rm kHz}$. This effect probes details of the internal structure of merging neutron stars beyond their bulk properties such as tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a small radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the currently inferred values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations). In this paper, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state (EOSs) for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J1814-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J1814-338 are only stable for a "stiff" low density phase. For a "soft" hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cryoscope--a new 50 deg$^2$ field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, $K_{dark}$ survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, and NEO Surveyor. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the $K_{dark}$ passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation. We plan to deploy the Cryoscope Pathfinder to Dome C in December 2026 and the full-scale telescope by 2030.</description>

      <title>Study of Open Star Clusters Using the Gaia DR3: I- Poorly Studied King 2 and King 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize photometric and kinematic data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and the {\sc ASteCA} package to analyze the sparsely studied open clusters, King 2 and King 5. For King 2, we identify 340 probable members with membership probabilities exceeding 50\%. Its mean proper motion components are determined as $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-1.407 \pm 0.008, -0.863 \pm 0.012)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its limiting radius is derived as $6.94_{-1.06}^{+0.22}$ arcminutes based on radial density profiles. The cluster has an estimated age of $4.80 \pm 0.30$ Gyr, a distance of $6586 \pm 164$ pc, and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.25$ dex ($z = 0.0088$). We detect 17 blue straggler stars (BSSs) concentrated in its core, and its total mass is estimated to be $356 \pm 19~M_{\odot}$. The computed apex motion is $(A_o,~D_o) = (-142^\circ.61 \pm 0^\circ.08, -63^\circ.58 \pm 0^\circ.13)$. Similarly, King 5 consists of 403 probable members with mean proper motion components $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-0.291 \pm 0.005, -1.256 \pm 0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and a limiting radius of $11.33_{-2.16}^{+5.45}$ arcminutes. The cluster's age is determined as $1.45 \pm 0.10$ Gyr, with a distance of $2220 \pm 40$ pc and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.15$ dex ($z = 0.0109$). We identify 4 centrally concentrated BSSs, and the total mass is estimated as $484 \pm 22~M_{\odot}$. The apex motion is calculated as $(A_o,~D_o) = (-115^\circ.10 \pm 0^\circ.09, -73^\circ.16 \pm 0^\circ.12)$. The orbital analysis of King 2 and King 5 indicates nearly circular orbits, characterized by low eccentricities and minimal variation in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. King 2 and King 5 reach maximum heights of $499 \pm 25$ pc and $177 \pm 2$ pc from the Galactic plane, respectively, confirming their classification as young stellar disc population.</description>
