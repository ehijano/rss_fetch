      <title>On $\sqrt{T\overline{T}}$ deformed pathways: CFT to CCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the marginal $\sqrt{T\overline{T}}$ deformation of massless scalar field theories in two dimensions from a dynamical perspective. The operator flow equations for such deformations induce a particular Legendre Transformation between flowed Lagrangians and flowed Hamiltonians. The marginal deformation does not change the conformal symmetries of the theory, until some special points in the moduli space are reached, and the relativistic conformal algebra smoothly changes to the Carrollian conformal (equivalently BMS) one. We investigate this change of symmetry from both configuration space and phase space point of view, while keeping the notion of Legendre Transformation unchanged during the flow. By expanding the actions, in the extreme limits of the flow parameter, we recover the usual ``Electric'' Carroll theory and further uncover a novel ``Magnetic'' counterpart. We discuss the intriguing geometric understanding of such dynamical maps for the deformed theories, and also provide a concrete example for the same from a deformed string theory in flat space.</description>

      <title>Reduced superblocks at next-to-next-to-extremality for all maximally supersymmetric CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mixed four-point correlators of 1/2-BPS operators $\mathcal{O}_{k_i}$ in the maximally supersymmetric CFTs, i.e. the 3d $\mathcal{N}=8$, 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$, and 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories. In \cite{Dolan:2004mu}, Dolan, Gallot, and Sokatchev demonstrated that four-point correlators of identical $\mathcal{O}_{k_i}$ in these SCFTs can be expressed in terms of unconstrained ``reduced correlators" $\mathcal{T}^{\{k_i\}}_{I,J}(U,V)$, $h^{\{k_i\}}_I(z)$ acted on by a $2(\varepsilon-1)^\text{nd}$ order differential operator $\Delta_\varepsilon$, which is non-local in odd dimensions $d=2(\varepsilon+1)$. We generalize this construction to mixed correlators $\langle \mathcal{O}_{k_1}\mathcal{O}_{k_2}\mathcal{O}_{k_3}\mathcal{O}_{k_1+k_2+k_3-2\mathcal{E}}\rangle$ up to extremality $\mathcal{E}=2$. To construct superconformal blocks, we generalize the R-symmetry channel equations and use Jack polynomial expansions to recursively generate the full spectrum of conformal blocks in a superblock from a single channel. We observe that this channel equation can be inverted to expand $\mathcal{T}^{\{k_i\}}_{I,J}$, $h^{\{k_i\}}_I$ in ``reduced" blocks with shifted kinematics $(\tilde{\Delta}_{12},\tilde{\Delta}_{34})=\left(\Delta_{12},\Delta_{34}-2(\varepsilon-1)\right)$. These reduced blocks reproduce what is known in 4d, generalize the known $\langle \mathcal{O}_{2}\mathcal{O}_{2}\mathcal{O}_{k}\mathcal{O}_{k}\rangle$ case in 6d, and offer a novel result in 3d.</description>

      <title>A Computational Companion to Transient de Sitter and Quasi de Sitter States in SO(32) and E_8 X E_8 Heterotic String Theories I: Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct four-dimensional de Sitter space as an excited state, rather than as a vacuum configuration, in type IIB, heterotic SO(32), and heterotic E_8 \times E_8 string theories. This framework provides a mechanism to evade vacuum-based no-go theorems for de Sitter solutions in string theory. Starting from a generic M-theory configuration, we obtain de Sitter isometry in the dual string theories through appropriate dynamical duality sequences in the late-time limit. The excited state, identified as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, is constructed as the expectation value of the metric operator in M-theory using path-integral techniques.
  We further analyze the conditions required for the existence of a well-defined effective field theory description and show that these conditions are equivalent to the Null Energy Condition for a (3+1)-dimensional FLRW cosmology. Finally, we investigate constraints arising from axionic cosmology and demonstrate how the time-dependent solutions are modified when experimental bounds on the axionic coupling constant are taken into account.
  This article serves as a computational companion to sections 3 and 4 of the paper https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.03798.</description>

      <title>Extended symmetry of the Maxwell theory with a gauge coupling constant as a conserved charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that any coupling constant in a covariant action
  can be treated as a conserved charge by promoting the coupling constant to auxiliary fields, typically realized by a scalar field paired with a
  higher-form gauge field. However, the procedure may break local symmetries,
  which can be explicitly shown in a simpler setting such as Maxwell theory.
  The Hamiltonian analysis of Maxwell theory with the auxiliary fields
  reveals that some of the constraints are second-class. Applying the BFT formalism, we restore the broken local symmetries and obtain
  a fully symmetric action defined on an extended configuration space. Despite the restoration of the local symmetries, no additional conserved charges are associated with the recovered symmetries.
  Consequently, the original theory turns out to be the gauge-fixed version of the
  extended theory.</description>

      <title>Heavy holographic correlators in defect conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic defect conformal field theories which are dual to probe branes with bottom-up methods. First we determine the embedding of codimension-1 probe branes in AdS space. Then we compute defect one and two-point correlation functions of heavy scalar operators at strong coupling. In particular, we use geodesic approximations to compute scalar two-point functions across the defect, reflected two-point functions, and ambient channel two-point functions. In appropriate limits, our results agree with the boundary operator expansion (BOE) and the operator product expansion (OPE).</description>

      <title>The thermal backreaction of a scalar field in dS spacetime. II. Spectrum enhancement and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a spacetime obtained from the semi-classical backreaction computed via the Thermofield dynamics approach in the Poincare patch of de Sitter spacetime. The resulting bulk equation takes the Whittaker form and we examine two distinct applications. At leading order, the co-moving curvature perturbations are shown to match a constant-roll model in the frozen attractor regime, corresponding to a UV enhancement of the spectrum with $n_S \sim 2$. In the holographic context, we compute the CFT two-point function at the future boundary, and away from it we construct the flow-equation of the dual QFT that matches beta-function of the Sp(N ) model in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Lattice U(1) Chern-Simons Theory via Lattice Deligne-Beilinson Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define Deligne-Beilinson (DB) cohomology on a cubic lattice and use it to formulate and analyze lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory at even levels. The continuum DB cohomology provides a refined mathematical framework for continuum $U(1)$ connections constructed in a patchwise manner. The lattice DB cohomology we construct retains many essential properties of the continuum DB cohomology and naturally incorporates a notion of self-linking number. The lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action formulated using the lattice DB cohomology is expressed as a simple quadratic form via the star product, which naturally exhibits level quantization. Framed Wilson lines respecting staggered symmetry are defined in a gauge-invariant manner, and their expectation values are shown to be given by the self-linking number, as follows from completing the square. Using the lattice Hodge decomposition, we explicitly characterize the DB cohomology on a three-dimensional cubic toroidal lattice and present a gauge-fixed, rigorous path integral for the lattice Chern-Simons theory. To regulate divergences in the lattice Chern-Simons path integral arising from staggered symmetry, we introduce a small Maxwell term. The resulting error is controlled by the linear order in the small Maxwell coupling.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle correlators with higher KK modes I: a bootstrap approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bootstrap tree-level supergravity four-point correlators on AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ with one external half-BPS double-particle operator and three half-BPS single-particle operators. Our only input is the consistency of the operator product expansion of $SU(N)$ ${\cal N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory at large $N$ and large 't Hooft coupling. Even though the leading order OPE does not close on double-particle operators, but involves triple-particle operators, the CFT data of the double-particle operators, both long and protected, is sufficient to uniquely fix the correlators. We then verify that our results for the four-point correlators with one double-particle and three single-particle operators are reproduced by the appropriate double-particle limit of the five-point tree-level correlators of single-particle operators, with arbitrary Kaluza-Klein levels, recently conjectured in arXiv:2507.14124. Our study thus provides further evidence for the latter result.</description>

      <title>Matrix Bootstrap Approximation without Positivity Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bootstrap approximation method for the Hermitian one-matrix model that does not rely on positivity constraints. The theoretical foundation of this method is that the one-matrix model admits an eigenvalue distribution $\rho(\lambda)$, and that the moments $w_n$ generated from it satisfy the loop equations. Our framework is designed to numerically determine a self-consistent pair of $\rho(\lambda)$ and $w_n$ that simultaneously satisfies these two requirements. In the concrete implementation, we employ a least-squares method, for which no sign problem arises in principle, and therefore the method can be formally applied also to Minkowski-type models. Actual numerical calculations show that this bootstrap approximation reproduces, with very high accuracy, the exact solutions for Euclidean-type models and the perturbative results for Minkowski-type models.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory and Skein Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study skein modules of 3-manifolds by embedding them into the Hilbert spaces of 4d ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theories. When the 3-manifold has reduced holonomy, we present an algorithm to determine the dimension and the list of generators of the skein module with a general gauge group. The analysis uses a deformation preserving ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry to express the dimension as a sum over nilpotent orbits. We find that the dimensions often differ between Langlands-dual pairs beyond the A-series, for which we provide a physical explanation involving chiral symmetry breaking and 't Hooft operators. We also relate our results to the structure of $\mathbb{C}^*$-fixed loci in the moduli space of Higgs bundles. This approach helps to clarify the relation between the gauge-theoretic framework of Kapustin and Witten with other versions of the geometric Langlands program, explains why the dimensions of skein modules do not exhibit a TQFT-like behavior, and provides a physical interpretation of the skein-valued curve counting of Ekholm and Shende.</description>

      <title>Compact Stars Sourced by Dark Matter Halos and Their Frozen States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -\rho$ condition between radial pressure and density. We demonstrate that while RBHs are a unique special case, a broader class of relations yields horizonless compact stars. Under specific parameter limits, these objects approach a ``frozen state," mimicking black hole features without an event horizon. These compact star solutions could satisfy weak energy conditions and provide a robust mechanism for dark matter-sourced black hole mimickers.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional teleportation using scrambling dynamics: a practical protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum information scrambling can enable a generic SWAP gate between collective degrees of freedom in systems without universal local control. Our protocol combines the Hayden-Preskill recovery scheme, associated with the black hole information paradox, with quantum teleportation and runs them in parallel and in opposite directions, enabling bidirectional exchange of quantum states through global interactions alone. This approach cleanly distinguishes the roles of information spreading, entanglement, and chaos for enabling both coherent state transfer and recovery. We propose an experimental realization using the Dicke model, which can be realized in cavity-QED and trapped-ion platforms, highlighting the utility of holography in designing practical quantum gates.</description>

      <title>A Modified Center-of-Mass Conservation Law in Finite-Domain Simulations of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate conservation laws of the two-dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, a natural higher-dimensional and non-integrable extension of the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational equal-area law and critical phenomena of cuspy black hole shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of a cusp on a black hole shadow is a striking signature of physics beyond the Kerr paradigm. We demonstrate that this morphological change fundamentally alters the shadow's topology with the topological charge flipping from 1 to -1. To analyze this topological transition, we introduce a gravitational equal-area law, analogous to Maxwell's construction in thermodynamics, and identify a critical point for cusp formation. Near this point, we uncover universal behavior characterized by a critical exponent 1/2, which places this gravitational lensing system within the mean-field universality class. These results establish a new framework for testing fundamental physics of black hole shadows, reframing the search for deviations from general relativity as a targeted hunt for a distinct topological and critical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the chiral and deconfinement transitions from a Curci-Ferrari-based Polyakov loop potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We couple the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to a gluonic background corresponding to the gauge-field expectation value in the center-symmetric Landau gauge. Low-energy features in this gauge are captured by a center-symmetric extension of the Curci-Ferrari model and provide a good grasp on key aspects of the confinement/deconfinement transition. Within this framework, we can investigate the interplay between the chiral and deconfinement transitions. Compared to other approaches based on multi-parameter Ans\"atze of the Polyakov loop potential fixed from comparison to finite-temperature lattice data, the modeling of the glue sector in the present set-up depends on only one phenomenological parameter that can be fixed by comparison to lattice data in the vacuum. We detail the structure of the phase diagram, with special emphasis on the finite density axis, and compute thermodynamical observables relevant for applications. We also highlight the properties of the recently introduced net quark number response of the medium as a sensible probe of the phases of QCD, in particular as a tool to disambiguate the nature of certain regions of the phase diagram where the use of the Polyakov loops could lead to misinterpretations. Finally, we critically assess the sensitivity of our results to the various parameters, both in the glue sector and in the chiral sector.</description>

      <title>Weyl-transverse gravity with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the covariant phase space formulation of Weyl-transverse gravity (WTG) in the presence of general timelike and spacelike boundaries. WTG is classically equivalent to General Relativity (GR) but possesses a reduced gauge symmetry consisting of Weyl transformations and transverse diffeomorphisms, together with a fixed background volume form. This structure modifies the variational principle and the definition of conserved quantities relative to GR. We derive the symplectic potential, presymplectic current, and Hamiltonian generators associated with transverse diffeomorphisms, and we identify a set of boundary conditions under which the WTG action is differentiable. These include Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for both the auxiliary Weyl-invariant metric and the dynamical metric, as well as a natural implementation of York boundary conditions, for which WTG exhibits a particularly transparent geometric formulation. We obtain the Noether current and surface charge, clarify the role of the Lagrangian ambiguity related to the cosmological constant, and evaluate the Hamiltonian identity on spacetimes containing a bifurcate Killing horizon. The resulting first-law relation shows that variations of the cosmological constant can contribute nontrivially unless additional physical restrictions are imposed.</description>

      <title>Exact Kerr-Newman-(A)dS and other spacetimes in bumblebee gravity: employing a novel generating technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that if the bumblebee field in the Einstein-bumblebee theory is given by its vacuum expectation value ($B_{\mu}=b_{\mu}$) and it is not dynamical ($\partial_{\mu}B_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu}=0$), then these conditions uniquely provide a generating technique, allowing us to construct exact solutions to bumblebee gravity from the vacuum solutions by adding a term $\sim b_{\mu}b_{\nu}$ to the metric tensor. Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Spectral Morphological Division of Fast Radio Bursts with CHIME/FRB Catalog 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>Carrier envelope phase and pulse shape effects on vacuum pair production in asymmetric electric fields with bell-shaped envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of carrier envelope phase and laser pulse shape on electron-positron pair production in the presence of an external time-dependent asymmetric electric field by solving the quantum Vlasov equation. We analyze how the pulse asymmetry, the envelope type (Gaussian, Lorentzian and Sauter), and the carrier envelope phase jointly influence the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs. Our results show that pair production exhibits extreme sensitivity to both the degree of temporal asymmetry and the steepness of the envelope on either side of the pulse. These effects are qualitatively explained through a turning-point analysis, which, for the first time, is carried out for a non-analytic electric field using a regularization scheme. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates the Schwinger mechanism in the case of a long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-topped profile, pair production is further facilitated. We demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude by choosing certain field parameters.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-bosonic Klein-Gordon field with finite two-points function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of pseudo-bosonic Klein-Gordon fields in 1+1 dimensions and we discuss some of their properties. This work originates from non Hermitian quantum mechanics and deformed canonical commutation relations. We show that, within this class of fields, there exist a specific subclass with the interesting feature of having finite equal space-time two-points function, contrarily to what happens for {\em standard} Klein-Gordon fields. This, in our opinion, is a relevant aspect of our proposal which is a good motivation to undertake a deeper analysis of this (and related) quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 4. Percent-Level Cosmological Constraints from Combined Probes and Robust Evidence for the Normal Neutrino Mass Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present cosmological parameters measurements from the full combination of DESI DR1 galaxy clustering data described with large-scale structure effective field theory. By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\pm 0.37~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $\Omega_m=0.2973\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.815\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.811\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\%$, $1.7\%$, and $2\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6\sigma$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8\sigma$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_\nu&lt;0.057$ eV in $\Lambda$CDM and $M_\nu&lt;0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date. Our results suggest that the preference for the normal ordering of neutrino mass states holds regardless of the cosmological background model, and is robust in light of tensions between cosmological datasets.</description>

      <title>A Two-Loop Four-Point Form Factor at Function Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the maximally-helicity-violating four-point form factor for the chiral stress-energy tensor in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills was computed to three loops at the level of the symbol associated with multiple polylogarithms. It exhibits {\it antipodal self-duality}, or invariance under the combined action of a kinematic map and reversing the ordering of letters in the symbol. Here we lift the two-loop form factor from symbol level to function level. We provide an iterated representation of the function's derivatives (coproducts). In order to do so, we find a three-parameter limit of the five-parameter phase space where the symbol's letters are all rational. We also use function-level information about dihedral symmetries and the soft, collinear, and factorization limits, as well as limits governed by the form-factor operator product expansion (FFOPE). We provide plots of the remainder function on several kinematic slices, and show that the result is compatible with the FFOPE data. We further verify that antipodal self-duality is valid at two loops beyond the level of the symbol.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Corrections to Thermodynamics of Accelerating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As pointed out in recent research, the near extremal black hole entropy with one-loop effect exhibits universal $\log T$ behavior at sufficiently low temperature. In this paper, we discuss the low-temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four-dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a warped and twisted product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>4d Maxwell on the Edge: Global Aspects of Boundary Conditions and Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Maxwell theory in 4d with a boundary, with particular attention to the global properties of the boundary conditions, both in the free (topological) and interacting (conformal) cases. We analyze the fate of Wilson-'t Hooft lines, identifying the subset that is trivialized on the boundary and the ones that become topological, thus generating a boundary 1-form symmetry. We further study how the boundary conditions are mapped to each other by 3d topological interfaces implementing bulk dualities and rescalings of the coupling. Together, these interfaces generate an $SL(2,\mathbb{Q})$ action on the bulk complexified coupling $\tau$, and they generalize the usual $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ action on 3d CFTs by including both topological and non-topological manipulations within a unified framework. We then show how to recover our results in a streamlined way from a SymTFT picture in 5d with corners. Finally, we comment on the possible inclusion of non-compact 3d edge modes.</description>

Abstract: We extend recent discussions on generalization of the Connected Wedge Theorem about $2$-to-$2$ holographic scattering problem to $n$-to-$n$ scatterings ($n&gt;2$). In this broader setting, our theorem provides a weaker necessary condition for the connectedness of boundary entanglement wedges than previously identified. Besides, we prove a novel sufficient condition for this connectedness. We also present an analysis of the criteria ensuring a non-empty entanglement wedge intersection region $\mathcal{S}_E$. These results refine the holographic dictionary between geometric connectivity and quantum entanglement for general multi-particle scattering.</description>

Abstract: We consider higher-point generalizations of the "octagon" large-charge four-point function in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. These n-point polygon correlators are defined as ten-dimensional null limits of generating functions of n-point correlators of protected scalar operators with arbitrary R-charge, and are conjecturally dual to massive scattering amplitudes of W-bosons on the Coulomb branch of the theory. We present a twistor-based direct computation of the polygon loop integrands, and determine the two-loop integrands for any number of external operators. The result is expressed as a linear combination of conformal integrals, with coefficients that are rational functions of the spacetime distances and operator polarizations. We obtain an exact match with a one-loop integrability computation, and study the near-massless limit of the pentagon function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence for $\mathcal{N}=4$ $U(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on $S^3/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma \subset SU(2)$ is a finite subgroup, leading to an ADE singularity in the bulk AdS geometry. We show that a large vacuum degeneracy arises from the choice of gauge holonomy on $S^3/\Gamma$. On the gravity side, we argue that the bulk ADE singularity supports topological degrees of freedom responsible for this degeneracy. We then provide a holographic derivation of a corresponding large vacuum degeneracy for class S theories of type $U(N)$, showing that these topological degrees of freedom admit an effective description in terms of a three-dimensional level-$N$ Chern-Simons theory, whose gauge group $\mathsf{G}$ is determined by $\Gamma$. Finally, we discuss how the one-form symmetries of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory are realized on the Chern-Simons theory side.</description>

      <title>Duality and Axion Wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prototype of a Euclidean wormhole solution of Einstein gravity coupled to matter is the axion wormhole in four spacetime dimensions. In this primarily expository article, we spell out some details about this construction. The axion wormhole has a semiclassical description, found in the original paper [1], in which the matter system is a two-form gauge field B with three-form field strength H=dB. The two-form is dual to a massless scalar, but the wormhole does not have a semiclassical description in terms of the scalar. There is no contradiction here as the duality between the two-form and the scalar is not a simple transformation of classical fields but involves, in Euclidean signature, a Poisson resummation of the sum over fluxes. Because of the need for this Poisson resummation, the scalar field cannot be treated semiclassically in the wormhole throat. Nonetheless, it is straightforward to compute the effective action derived from the wormhole in the scalar (or two-form) language, recovering standard claims.</description>

      <title>Probing Black Hole Thermal Effects in the Dual CFT via Wave Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the gravitational effects of a black hole manifest themselves as thermal behavior in the dual finite-temperature conformal field theory (CFT). In the holographic framework of AdS/CFT, we analyze a wave packet propagating into a black hole geometry in the bulk by computing three-point functions of a scalar primary operator in the boundary CFT. Our setup captures thermal signatures such as exponential damping of the expectation value, which are absent at zero-temperature. This provides a concrete and analytically tractable example of how black hole physics can be probed from the CFT side.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>

      <title>GW/DT invariants and 5D BPS indices for strips from topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological string theory partition function gives rise to Gromov-Witten invariants, Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 5D BPS indices. Using the remodeling conjecture, which connects Topological Recursion with topological string theory for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, we study a more direct connection for the subclass of strip geometries. In doing so, new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$-$y$ duality. Through these techniques, our main result in this paper is a direct derivation of all free energies from topological recursion for general strip geometries. In analyzing the expression of free energy, we shed some light on the meaning and the influence of the $x$-$y$ duality in topological string theory and its interconnection to GW and DT invariants as well as the 5D BPS index.</description>

      <title>Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM. In particular, gamma-ray lines could provide a way to measure the DM mass. The excellent energy resolution of the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) will allow us to probe underexplored regions of the DM parameter space while being sensitive to distinctive spectral features of potential DM signals. In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). We estimate the sensitivities of COSI and AMEGO-X to sub-GeV DM in this context, considering a B-L and a purely axial $Z'$ as benchmark examples. We find regions of the parameter space where COSI will provide leading constraints, beyond the strong CMB limits. On the other hand, AMEGO-X would probe most of the viable parameter space leading to continuum gamma rays. The implementation of our generic vector-scalar portal model in the Hazma toolkit is available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>A gravitational spin-orbit interaction in Poincar\'e gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a gravitational spin-orbit interaction that can potentially modify the space-time geometry naturally emerges in the framework of Poincar\'e gauge theory. For this purpose, we derive the field equations of a particular model with cubic order invariants and demonstrate the existence of analytical solutions which display an interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic angular momentum parameters in the gravitational action, in analogy to the spin-orbit interaction arising from atomic and nuclear systems. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the field equations under stationary and axisymmetric conditions, we focus on a degenerate case which simplifies their complexity, at the cost of constraining the geometry to the Kerr space-time. Thereby, our results indicate more general solutions with a spin-orbit interaction beyond the Kerr space-time are expected to arise in the nondegenerate models of Poincar\'e gauge theory.</description>

      <title>An improved formula for Wigner function and spin polarization in a decoupling relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an upgraded formula for Wigner function and spin polarization of fermions emitted by a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the decoupling which improves the one obtained in refs. [1, 2] and used in numerical simulations of relativistic nuclear collisions. By using a new expansion method, applicable to decoupling hypersurfaces with arbitrary geometry, we reproduce the known term proportional to thermal vorticity and obtain an upgraded form of the spin-shear term which captures the dependence on the geometry. The new method also includes additional contributions whose physical nature is to be assessed. The new expression also naturally excludes contributions from space-time gradients in the normal direction of the hypersurface, providing a theoretical justification for the isothermal condition previously imposed a priori. This framework can be extended to particles with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Kruskal Universe: a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole in unitary unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the physical properties of an analytical, nonsingular quantum-corrected black hole solution recently derived in a minisuperspace model for unimodular gravity under the assumption of unitarity in unimodular time. We show that the metric corrections compared to the classical Schwarzschild solutions only depend on a single new parameter, corresponding to a minimal radius where a black hole-white hole transition occurs. While these corrections substantially alter the structure of the spacetime near this minimal radius, they fall off rapidly towards infinity, and we show in various examples how physical properties of the exterior spacetime are very close to those of the Schwarzschild solution. We derive the maximal analytic extension of the initial solution, which corresponds to an infinite sequence of Kruskal spacetimes connected via black-to-white hole transitions, and compare with some other proposals for non-singular black hole metrics. The metric violates the achronal averaged null energy condition, which indicates that we are capturing physics beyond the semiclassical approximation. Finally, we include some thoughts on how to go beyond the simple eternal black hole-white hole model presented here.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Multipole moments do not uniquely characterize spacetimes beyond general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments. Given the usefulness of moments in the categorization of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spatially homogeneous Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universes filled with a massive scalar field in a neighbourhood of the massless transition $s=1$. At this point the Einstein--scalar system exhibits a codimension--two Hopf--steady--state organising centre whose versal unfolding describes all small deformations of the quadratic model. After reduction to the centre manifold, the dynamics is governed by two slow geometric modes $(r,z)$: the Hopf amplitude $r$, measuring the kinetic departure from de Sitter, and the slowly drifting Hubble mode $z$. We show that the standard slow--roll parameters follow directly from these unfolding variables, $\epsilon\sim\tfrac32 r^{2}$ and $\eta\sim z$, so that the spectral tilt, tensor--to--scalar ratio, and scalar amplitude arise as universal functions of $(r,z)$, independently of the choice of potential. The two unfolding parameters $(\mu_{1},\mu_{2})$ classify all perturbations of the quadratic model and can be interpreted physically as controlling the tilt and curvature deformations of generic polynomial inflationary potentials. Thus the near scale--invariance of primordial perturbations emerges as a structural property of the unfolding of the organising centre, providing a potential--independent mechanism for an early phase of accelerated expansion. We discuss the implications of this geometric framework for the interpretation and classification of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Lorentz-Dirac Dynamics and Post-Newtonian Interaction of Radiating Point Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy for Screened Interactions via Dimensional Mapping to Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate interaction-induced corrections to entanglement entropy by mapping a screened Yukawa-type interaction to an effective harmonic oscillator system with controlled anharmonic perturbations. Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-\alpha m x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $\rho^4$, which appears at order $\alpha^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $\alpha^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $\alpha$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $\rho^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic systems.</description>
