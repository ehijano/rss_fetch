      <title>And if Vulcan was a primordial black hole of planetary-mass ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I re-examine the question of a possible explanation for the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion by the existence of a hypothetical planet, Vulcan, which I consider to be a kind of primordial black hole of planetary-mass. The detection of this kind of celestial body has become possible with modern experimental techniques, inter alia, such as the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Recently, an excess of ultra-short microlensing events with crossing times of 0.1 to 0.3 days has been reported, suggesting the possible existence of sub-Earth-mass primordial black holes in our solar system. The primordial black hole Vulcan planetary mass hypothesis could then explain the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion under the influence of its gravitational attraction, still remaining hidden from astronomers' telescopes. But in this case, it will also influence the perihelion advance of the other planets. To this end, I first calculate the mutual partial contributions to the perihelion motion of all the planets by two different methods without Vulcan in a model of simplified solar system consisting of the Sun and eight planets. Next, I include Vulcan in this model within the framework of the Newtonian theory of classical gravitation and analyze Vulcan's influence on the perihelion advance of the inner planets, using Vulcan parameters from my previous work. These results are compared with the perihelion advances of the inner planets predicted by the theory of general relativity, and with the data obtained by modern observations.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a volcanic atmosphere on the sub-Earth L98-59b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets around M-dwarf stars is a top priority of exoplanet science. High-energy activity from M-dwarfs can destroy the atmospheres of these planets, which could explain the lack of atmosphere detections to date. Volcanic outgassing has been proposed as a mechanism to replenish the atmospheres of tidally-heated rocky planets. L 98-59 b, a sub-Earth transiting a nearby M dwarf, was recently identified as the most promising exoplanet to detect a volcanic atmosphere. We present the transmission spectrum of L 98-59 b from four transits observed with JWST NIRSpec G395H. Although the airless model provides an adequate fit to the data based on its $\chi^2$, an SO$_2$ atmosphere is preferred by 3.6$\sigma$ over a flat line in terms of the Bayesian evidence. Such an atmosphere would likely be in a steady state where volcanism balances escape. If so, L 98-59 b must experience at least eight times as much volcanism and tidal heating per unit mass as Io. If volcanism is driven by runaway melting of the mantle, we predict the existence of a subsurface magma ocean in L 98-59 b extending up to $R_p\sim 60-90\%$. An SO$_2$-rich volcanic atmosphere on L 98-59 b would be indicative of an oxidized mantle with an oxygen fugacity of $f\rm{O}_2&gt;IW+2.7$, and it would imply that L 98-59 b must have retained some of its volatile endowment despite its proximity to its star. Our findings suggest that volcanism may revive secondary atmospheres on tidally heated rocky planets around M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Updated Mass, Eccentricity, and Tidal Heating Constraints for the Earth-sized Planet LP 791-18 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LP 791-18 d is a temperate Earth-sized planet orbiting a late M dwarf, surrounded by an interior super-Earth (LP 791-18 b, $R_P$ = 1.2 $R_{\oplus}$, $P=0.95$ days) and an exterior sub-Neptune (LP 791-18 c, $R_P$ = 2.5 $R_{\oplus}$, $P=4.99$ days). Dynamical interactions between LP 791-18 d and c produce transit timing variations (TTVs) that can be used to constrain the planet masses and eccentricities. These interactions can also force a non-zero eccentricity for LP 791-18 d, which raises its internal temperature through tidal heating and could drive volcanic outgassing. We present three new transit observations of LP 791-18 c with Palomar/WIRC, including the most precise TTV measurements ($&lt;$ 6 seconds) of this planet to date. We fit these times with a TTV model to obtain updated constraints on the mass, eccentricity, and tidal heat flux of LP 791-18 d. We reduce the mass uncertainty by more than a factor of two ($M_d$ = 0.91 $\pm$ 0.19 $M_{\oplus}$). We perform an updated fit assuming tidally damped free eccentricities and find $e_d = 0.0011^{+0.0010}_{-0.0008}$ and $e_c = 0.0001 \pm 0.0001$, consistent with circular orbits. We find that the observed TTVs are not sensitive to $e \leq$ $\sim$0.01. Without a tidally damped eccentricity prior, $e_d = 0.056^{+0.015}_{-0.014}$, much higher than the eccentricity predicted by n-body simulations incorporating the effects of dynamical excitation and tidal damping. We predict the timing of upcoming JWST secondary eclipse observations for LP 791-18 d, which could tightly constrain the eccentricity and tidal quality factor of this Earth-sized exoplanet.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Estimate the FUV Flux and a Catalogue for Star-Hosting Discs in Nearby Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary discs, when externally irradiated by Far Ultraviolet (FUV) photons from OBA-type stars, lose material through photoevaporative winds, reducing the amount of material available to form planets. Understanding the link between environmental irradiation and observed disc properties requires accurately evaluating the FUV flux at star-hosting discs, which can be challenging due stellar parallax uncertainties. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a novel approach: using the local density distribution of a star-forming region (i.e. 2D pairwise star separations distribution) and assuming isotropy, we infer 3D separations between star-hosting discs and massive stars. We test this approach on synthetic clusters, showing that it significantly improves the accuracy compared to previous methods. We compute FUV fluxes for a large sample of star-bearing discs in 7 regions within 200 pc, 6 regions in Orion, and Serpens sub-regions, providing a publicly accessible catalogue. We find that discs in regions hosting late-type B and early-type A stars can reach non-negligible irradiation levels for disc evolution (10-100 G0). We investigate dust disc masses relative to FUV fluxes detecting hints of a negative correlation when restricting to average region ages. However, we emphasize the need for more stellar and disc measurements at &gt;10^2 G0 to probe the dependence of disc properties on the environmental irradiation. Including average interstellar dust extinction, median FUV fluxes are not significantly attenuated, though this result may change if high-resolution 3D dust extinction maps were available. The method presented in this work is a powerful tool that can be expanded to additional regions.</description>

      <title>FAUST XX. The chemical structure and temperature profile of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino at 20-50 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young low-mass protostars often possess hot corinos, compact, hot and dense regions bright in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs). Besides of their prebiotic role, iCOMs can be used as a powerful tool to characterize the chemical and physical properties of hot corinos. Using ALMA/FAUST data we aim to explore the iCOMs emission at &lt; 50 au scale around the Class 0 prototypical hot corino IRAS 4A2. We imaged IRAS 4A2 in six abundant, common iCOMs (CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_2$OHCHO, and NH$_2$CHO), and derived their emitting size. The column density and gas temperature for each species were derived at 1$\sigma$ from a multi-line analysis by applying a non-LTE approach for CH$_3$OH, and LTE population or rotational diagram analysis for the other iCOMs. Thanks to the unique estimates of the absorption from foreground millimeter dust toward IRAS 4A2, we derived for the first time unbiased gas temperatures and column densities. We resolved the IRAS 4A2 hot corino finding evidence for a chemical spatial distribution in the inner 50 au, with the outer emitting radius increasing from ~ 22-23 au for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_2$OHCHO, followed by CH$_3$CH$_2$OH (~ 27 au), CH$_3$CHO (~ 28 au), HCOOCH$_3$ (~ 36 au), and out to ~ 40 au for CH$_3$OH. Combining our estimate of the gas temperature probed by each iCOM with their beam-deconvolved emission sizes, we inferred the gas temperature profile of the hot corino on scales of 20-50 au in radius, finding a power-law index $q$ of approximately -1. We observed, for the first time, a chemical segregation in iCOMs of the IRAS 4A2 hot corino, and derived the gas temperature profile of its inner envelope. The derived profile is steeper than when considering a simple spherical collapsing and optically-thin envelope, hinting at a partially optically-thick envelope or a gravitationally unstable disk-like structure.</description>

      <title>Circumstellar and circumbinary discs in multiple stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between stellar multiplicity and protoplanetary discs represents a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, offering key insights into the processes of planet formation. Protoplanetary discs act as cradles for planetary systems, yet their evolution and capacity to form planets are profoundly affected by gravitational forces within multiple stellar systems. This review synthesises recent advancements in observational and theoretical studies to explore the rich diversity of circumstellar and circumbinary discs within multiple stellar systems. We examine how stellar companions shape disc morphology through truncation, spirals, and misalignment. We also outline how dust dynamics and planetesimal formation are impacted by stellar multiplicity. On top of this, observations at high angular resolution reveal detailed disc structures, while simulations offer key insights into their evolution. Last, we consider the implications of stellar multiplicity for planetary system architectures, emphasising the diversity of planetary outcomes in such environments. Looking ahead, coordinated efforts combining high-resolution observations with advanced numerical models will be critical for unravelling the role of multiple stellar systems in shaping planetary formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Kepler meets Gaia DR3: homogeneous extinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram and binary classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original Kepler mission has delivered unprecedented high-quality photometry. These data have impacted numerous research fields (e.g., asteroseismology and exoplanets), and continue to be an astrophysical goldmine. Because of this, thorough investigations of the ~ 200,000 stars observed by Kepler remain of paramount importance. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art characterization of the Kepler targets based on Gaia DR3 data. We place the stars on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), account for the effects of interstellar extinction, and classify targets into several CMD categories (dwarfs, subgiants, red giants, photometric binaries, and others). Additionally, we report various categories of candidate binary systems spanning a range of detection methods, such as Renormalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE), radial velocity variables, Gaia non-single stars (NSS), Kepler and Gaia eclipsing binaries from the literature, among others. First and foremost, our work can assist in the selection of stellar and exoplanet host samples regarding CMD and binary populations. We further complement our catalog by quantifying the impact that astrometric differences between Gaia data releases have on CMD location, assessing the contamination in asteroseismic targets with properties at odds with Gaia, and identifying stars flagged as photometrically variable by Gaia. We make our catalog publicly available as a resource to the community when researching the stars observed by Kepler.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass stars and the origin of the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of known planets around intermediate-mass stars (1.5 M$_{\odot}$ &lt; M$_{\star}$ &lt; 3.5 M$_{\odot}$) is rather low. We aim to test whether the correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant planets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In particular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation changes as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results confirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower metallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of intermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation, although the differences in metal content between planet and non-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is significantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the red giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible with that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in the convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured metallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity correlation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a scenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material on the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the metallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the composition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops a sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is recovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet formation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk property of the star.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Dynamos Sustained by a Modified Ohm's Law in a Toroidal Volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work tackles a significant challenge in dynamo theory: the possibility of long-term amplification and maintenance of an axisymmetric magnetic field. We introduce a novel model that allows for non-trivial axially-symmetric steady-state solutions for the magnetic field, particularly when the dynamo operates primarily within a ``nearly-spherical'' toroidal volume inside a fluid shell surrounding a solid core. In this model, Ohm's law is generalized to include the dissipative force, arising from electron collisions, that tends to align the velocity of the shell with the rotational speed of the inner core and outer mantle. Our findings reveal that, in this context, Cowling's theorem and the neutral point argument are modified, leading to magnetic energy growth for a suitable choice of toroidal flow. The global equilibrium magnetic field that emerges from our model exhibits a dipolar character. The central insight of the model developed here is that if an additional force is incorporated into Ohm's law, symmetric dynamos become possible.</description>

      <title>Constraining atmospheric composition from the outflow: helium observations reveal the fundamental properties of two planets straddling the radius gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-836 is a ~2-3 Gyr K dwarf with an inner super Earth ($R=1.7 R_\oplus$, $P=3.8$ d) and an outer mini Neptune ($R=2.6 R_\oplus$, $P=8.6$ d). JWST/NIRSpec 2.8--5.2 $\mu$m transmission spectra are flat for both planets. We present Keck/NIRSPEC observations of escaping helium for super-Earth b, which shows no excess absorption in the 1083 nm triplet to deep limits (&lt;0.2%), and mini-Neptune c, which shows strong (0.7%) excess absorption in both visits. These results demonstrate that planet c retains at least some primordial atmosphere, while planet b is consistent with having lost its entire primordial envelope. Self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamic models of planet c reveal that the helium excess absorption signal is highly sensitive to metallicity: its equivalent width collapses by a factor of 13 as metallicity increases from 10x to 100x solar, and by a further factor of 12 as it increases to 200x solar. The observed equivalent width is 88\% the model prediction for 100x metallicity, suggesting an atmospheric metallicity similar to K2-18b and TOI-270d, the first two mini-Neptunes with detected absorption features in JWST transmission spectra. We highlight the helium triplet as a potentially powerful probe of atmospheric composition, with complementary strengths and weaknesses to atmospheric retrievals. The main strength is its extreme sensitivity to metallicity in the scientifically significant range of 10--200x solar, and the main weakness is the enormous model uncertainties in outflow suppression and confinement mechanisms, such as magnetic fields and stellar winds, which can suppress the signal by at least a factor of ~several.</description>

Abstract: We present the first polarimetric observations of a circumstellar disk in the far-infrared wavelength range. We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114{\deg} at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.</description>
