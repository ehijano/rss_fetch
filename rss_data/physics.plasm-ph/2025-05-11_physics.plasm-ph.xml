      <title>Electromagnetic plasma waves in Big Bounce and Big Crunch cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exact dynamics of electromagnetic waves in cold electron-positron plasma in the simplest background of Big Bounce and Big Crunch cosmologies. We show that these waves are described by a Mathieu equation in a Big Bounce cosmology, which opens the possibility of electromagnetic wave amplification due to the cosmological constant in this Universe. On the contrary, in a Big Crunch cosmology, electromagnetic plasma waves are described by a modified Mathieu equation. In both cases, the features (grow/collapse) of the Universes imprint similar characteristics in the temporal evolution of these waves.</description>

      <title>Seedless magnetic field generation via ultraintense laser irradiation of an aluminum tetrafoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field generation and amplification techniques are popular due to their applications in several fields, including laboratory astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion. Microtube Implosion (MTI) is a scheme that amplifies a seed magnetic field by several orders of magnitude through ultraintense laser irradiation of solid targets. In this study, we conducted 2D EPOCH simulations to investigate the ability of a tetrafoil target to generate a magnetic field in the absence of a seed magnetic field. The results show that the tetrafoil target generates magnetic field intensities comparable to a hollow cylindrical aluminum target undergoing MTI with a 10kT seed. Furthermore, the configuration of the tetrafoil can be used to control the direction of the magnetic fields produced. The combined tetrafoil and microtube target sustained higher magnetic field and flux compared to both the microtube and tetrafoil targets, without the need for a seed magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the quasiparticle effective mass of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-space variation quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to calculate the quasiparticle energy bands and the quasiparticle effective mass of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic two-dimensional uniform electron liquid (2D-UEL)\@. The many-body finite-size errors are minimized by performing simulations for three system sizes with the number of electrons $N=146$, 218, and 302 for paramagnetic and $N=151$ for ferromagnetic systems. We consider 2D-UEL to be within the metallic density range $1\leq r_s \leq 5$. The VMC and DMC results predict that the quasiparticle effective mass $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL at high density $r_s=1$ is very close to 1, suggesting that effective mass renormalization due to electron-electron interaction is negligible. We find that $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL obtained by the VMC and DMC methods increases by $r_s$ but with different slopes. Our VMC and DMC results for ferromagnetic 2D-UEL indicate that $m^*$ decreases rapidly by reducing the density due to the strong suppression of the electron-electron interaction.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and safety of air plasma inactivated SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) displays antimicrobial, antitumor, and antiviral properties, while the underlying mechanism is seldom clearly elucidated. In this work, we employed CAP with air-feeding gas to directly inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The results indicate that the typical SARS-CoV-2 morphological spikes disappeared after plasma treatment and the proteosomes of SRAS-CoV-2 were modified. In addition, we also evaluated the safety of the air plasma device in simulating daily life environments through rat experiments. We evaluated rats' daily physiological behavior, body weight, food consumption, organ histopathology, blood biochemical indicators, and so on. These results demonstrate air plasma device is a safe and effective mean prevents virus transmissions and infections.</description>

      <title>Exploring exponential time integration for strongly magnetized charged particle motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental task in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of plasma physics is solving for charged particle motion in electromagnetic fields. This problem is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized due to numerical stiffness arising from the wide separation in time scales between highly oscillatory gyromotion and overall macroscopic behavior of the system. In contrast to conventional finite difference schemes, we investigated exponential integration techniques to numerically simulate strongly magnetized charged particle motion. Numerical experiments with a uniform magnetic field show that exponential integrators yield superior performance for linear problems (i.e. configurations with an electric field given by a quadratic electric scalar potential) and are competitive with conventional methods for nonlinear problems with cubic and quartic electric scalar potentials.</description>
