      <title>A dispersal recolonisation 3D biofilm in vitro model based on co-assembled peptide amphiphiles and clinical wound fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic wound infections are sustained by dynamic 3D biofilm cycles involving maturation, dispersal, and recolonisation, yet existing in vitro models fail to reproduce these temporal and structural complexities. Here, we report a strategy that co-assembles a designed protease-inhibitory peptide amphiphile (PA-GF) with patient-derived wound fluid (WF) to reconstruct the complete biofilm life cycle in vitro. The PA-GF sequence incorporates an HWGF motif capable of binding and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), thereby preserving the integrity of recolonised biofilms under proteolytic stress. Co-assembling with WF generated a living material that faithfully mimicked the biochemical and mechanical microenvironment of chronic wounds, supporting the formation of stable 3D biofilms capable of dispersal and recolonisation. Furthermore, we established a controllable polymicrobial infection model and validated its translational relevance through antibiotic susceptibility profiling and spatial microbiological analyses. Notably, the antibiotic response patterns of the PA/WF-derived biofilms closely mirrored those observed in a rat wound infection in vivo model. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that co-assembling living materials can recapitulate the nutritional composition, 3D architecture, and recolonisation dynamics of in vivo infectious biofilms, offering a physiologically relevant and customisable platform for investigating chronic wound infections and accelerating anti-biofilm drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Low-exposure, high-quality multimodal speckle X-ray imaging via an intrinsic gradient-flow approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20209</link>

Abstract: We present a new approach for retrieving dark-field, phase shift, and attenuation images from speckle-based X-ray imaging data. Speckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) exploits sample-induced alterations to a reference near-field speckle pattern produced by a randomly structured mask. Attenuation images allow materials of different densities to be visualised. Phase-shift images are useful because they reveal how materials in a sample refract the X-ray beam, providing contrast between similar low-density structures that are difficult to reconstruct in attenuation images. Dark-field images convey information about structures that are smaller than the spatial resolution and thus invisible in both attenuation and phase-shift images. In previous works, we presented the Multimodal Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking (MIST) algorithm, which recovers the three complementary imaging modes from SBXI data by solving the associated Fokker--Planck equation. In this work, we present a variation of MIST, called ``gradient-flow MIST", which (1) reduces the amount of SBXI data required for image retrieval, (2) maintains the full generality of the X-ray Fokker--Planck equation, and (3) recovers dark-field images with higher quality than the previously proposed variants for weakly attenuating (i.e., low density) samples. We demonstrate the new gradient-flow MIST approach on experimental SBXI data of a knotted bundle of carbon fibres acquired at the Australian synchrotron. This approach is anticipated to be useful in phase-contrast and dark-field applications that require simplicity in experimentation and low sample X-ray exposure.</description>
