      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of wavelength-sensitive magnons in unconventional compensated semiconducting antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnet is a promising candidate for the next generation spintronic devices, benefiting from its ultrafast dynamics and spontaneous zero stray field. However, the understanding of their ultrafast spin behaviors is lacking due to the challenges of controlling/detecting the quenched net magnetization. Unconventional compensated semiconducting antiferromagnets present strong time-reversal symmetry breaking, spin splitting in the momentum space, and suitable bandgap for optical control/detection. Thus, it is a powerful platform to uncover the ultrafast dynamics of antiferromagnets. Here, we show an exotic wavelength-dependent spin dynamic in the unconventional compensated semiconducting antiferromagnet {\alpha}-MnTe via time-resolved quadratic magneto-optical Kerr effect measurement, where the probing photon energy of the laser matches its bandgap. This direct excitation and detection of distinct magnon modes reveal varying spin behaviors and time characteristics in a broad temperature range. It originates from the spins triggered at different bands of electronic structures and is depicted in an energy transfer model among electrons, phonons, and magnons. Our study of exotic optical properties in this unconventional semiconducting antiferromagnet fulfills the missing information of spin evolution in the time domain and paves the way for its utilization in ultrafast spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mapping reaction mechanism during overcharge of a LiNiO2/Graphite-silicon lithium-ion battery: a correlative operando approach by simultaneous gas analysis and synchrotron scattering techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Li-ion battery degradation processes are multi-scale, heterogeneous, dynamic and involve multiple cell components through cross talk mechanisms. Correlated operando characterization capable of measuring several key parameters are needed to accelerate understanding on these complex degradation processes. In particular, degradation mechanisms during overcharge of LiNiO2/Graphite-Silicon is well known at the material level featuring O2 gas release and concomitant surface reconstruction of LiNiO2. However, there are still debates regarding the role of high voltage O1 phase formation on gas production and no information on the effect of produced gases on the cell components (anode or sensors), or effect of overcharge on electrode level behavior. In this work, we simultaneously measured the gas produced using operando mass spectrometry while spatially resolving nanostructure and lattice changes using operando micro SAXS/WAXS mapping during the formation and over charge of a LiNiO2/Gr-Si pouch cell. This new correlated operando characterization experiment allowed to (1) confirm the absence of O1 phase even with substantial gas produced at end of charge, (2) unveil the effect of gases on reference and negative electrodes, (3) show that overcharge increases in-plane reaction heterogeneities by creating local degraded spots lagging behind the ensemble electrochemistry. These findings will be important to optimize ageing of devices based on similar chemistries, in particular Ni-rich NMC, while showing the strength of correlated characterization leading to more efficient and robust information on complex mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Theoretical Limits of Efficiency in Multilayer Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photovoltaic materials are recognized for their potential as sustainable energy sources that enable the conversion between light and electrical energy. However, solar cells have been unable to surpass the theoretical limit of 32%, known as the Shockley-Queisser limit, and face challenges in effectively utilizing the broad spectrum of sunlight. To address this issue, extensive research is being conducted on multi-junction solar cells, which employ a layered structure comprising materials with varying bandgaps to more effectively harness the wide spectrum of sunlight. This study calculates the theoretical limit of these multi-junction solar cells and identifies optimal bandgap combinations, exploring new possibilities for photovoltaic devices and suggesting directions for technological advancement. The performance saw a 31% improvement when moving from a single layer to two layers, and a 12% improvement from two layers to three, with the average wavelength situated in the late 800nm range. The wavelength of the bottom layer increased by about 200nm, and that of the second layer by about 150nm. Our findings present new opportunities to surpass the current limitations of solar cell technology, potentially enhancing the economic feasibility and utility of solar energy as a sustainable source.</description>

      <title>Minimizing readout-induced noise for early fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting code can diagnose potential errors and correct them based on measured outcomes by leveraging syndrome measurement. However, mid-circuit measurement has been technically challenging for early fault-tolerant quantum computers and the readout-induced noise acts as a main contributor to the logical infidelity. We present a different method for syndrome extraction, namely Generalized Syndrome Measurement, that requires only a single-shot measurement on a single ancilla, while the canonical syndrome measurement requires multiple measurements to extract the eigenvalue for each stabilizer generator. As such, we can detect the error in the logical state with minimized readout-induced noise. By adopting our method as a pre-check routine for quantum error correcting cycles, we can significantly reduce the readout overhead, the idling time, and the logical error rate during syndrome measurement. We numerically analyze the performance of our protocol using Iceberg code and Steane code under realistic noise parameters based on superconducting hardware and demonstrate the advantage of our protocol in the near-term scenario. As mid-circuit measurements are still error-prone for near-term quantum hardware, our method may boost the applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Transport of skyrmions by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions in thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are promising candidates for magnetic memory and logic devices, making the development of ways to transport skyrmions efficiently and precisely of significant interest. Here, we investigate the transport of skyrmions by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) via several modalities using micromagnetic simulations. We show skyrmion pinning sites created by standing SAWs at anti-nodes and skyrmion Hall-like motion without pinning driven by travelling SAWs. We also show how orthogonal SAWs formed by combining a longitudinal travelling SAW and a transverse standing SAW can be used for the 2D positioning of skyrmions. Our results also suggest SAWs offer a viable approach to the transport of multiple skyrmions along multichannel racetrack.</description>
