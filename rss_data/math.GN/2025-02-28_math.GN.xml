      <title>The characterizations of hyperspaces and free topological groups with an $\omega^\omega$-base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is said to be have an {\it $\omega^\omega$-base} if for each point $x\in X$ there exists a neighborhood base $\{U_{\alpha}[x]: \alpha\in\omega^\omega\}$ such that $U_{\beta}[x]\subset U_{\alpha}[x]$ for all $\alpha\leq\beta$ in $\omega^\omega$. In this paper, the characterization of a space $X$ is given such that the free Abelian topological group $A(X)$, the hyperspace $CL(X)$ with the Vietoris topology and the hyperspace $CL(X)$ with the Fell topology have $\omega^\omega$-bases respectively. The main results are listed as follows:
  (1) For a Tychonoff space $X$, the free Abelian topological group $A(X)$ is a $k$-space with an $\omega^\omega$-base if and only if $X$ is a topological sum of a discrete space and a submetrizable $k_\omega$-space.
  (2) If $X$ is a metrizable space, then $(CL(X), \tau_V)$ has an $\omega^\omega$-base if and only if $X$ is separable and the boundary of each closed subset of $X$ is $\sigma$-compact.
  (3) If $X$ is a metrizable space, then $(CL(X), \tau_F)$ has an $\omega^\omega$-base consisting of basic neighborhoods if and only if $X$ is a Polish space.
  (4) If $X$ is a metrizable space, then $(CL(X), \tau_F)$ is a Fr\'echet-Urysohn space with an $\omega^\omega$-base, if and only if $(CL(X), \tau_F)$ is first-countable, if and only if $X$ is a locally compact and second countable space.</description>

      <title>Fixed point results for single and multi-valued three-points contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the study of the existence of fixed points for single and multi-valued three-points contractions. Namely, we first introduce a new class of single-valued mappings defined on a metric space equipped with three metrics. A fixed point theorem is established for such mappings. The obtained result recovers that established recently by the second author [J. Fixed Point Theory Appl. 25 (2023) 74] for the class of single-valued mappings contracting perimeters of triangles. We next extend our study by introducing the class of multivalued three points contractions. A fixed point theorem, which is a multi-valued version of that obtained in the above reference, is established. Some examples showing the validity of our obtained results are provided.</description>

      <title>Inferring a Cell Structure on the Space of Cyclooctane Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformation space of cyclooctane, a ringlike organic molecule comprising eight carbon atoms, is a two-dimensional algebraic variety, which has been studied extensively for more than 90 years. We propose a cell structure representing this space, which arises naturally by partitioning the space into subsets of conformations that admit particular symmetries. We do so both for the labeled conformation space, in which the carbon atoms are considered as distinct, and for the actual, unlabeled, conformation space. The proposed cell structure is obtained by identifying subspaces of conformations based on symmetry patterns and studying the geometry and topology of these subsets using methods from dimensionality reduction and topological data analysis. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to the labeled variant, the conformation space of cyclooctane is contractible.</description>

      <title>At most n-valued maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns various models of ``at-most-$n$-valued maps''. That is, multivalued maps $f:X\multimap Y$ for which $f(x)$ has cardinality at most $n$ for each $x$. We consider 4 classes of such maps which have appeared in the literature: $\mathcal U$, the set of exactly $n$-valued maps, or unions of such; $\mathcal F$, the set of $n$-fold maps defined by Crabb; $\mathcal S$, the set of symmetric product maps; and $\mathcal W$, the set of weighted maps with weights in $\mathbb N$. Our main result is roughly that these classes satisfy the following containments: \[ \mathcal U \subsetneq \mathcal F \subsetneq \mathcal S = \mathcal W \]
  Furthermore we define the general class $\mathcal C$ of all at-most-$n$-valued maps, and show that there are maps in $\mathcal C$ which are outside of any of the other classes above. We also describe a configuration-space point of view for the class $\mathcal C$, defining a configuration space $C_n(Y)$ such that any at-most-$n$-valued map $f:X\multimap Y$ corresponds naturally to a single-valued map $f:X\to C_n(Y)$. We give a full calculation of the fundamental group and homology groups of $C_n(S^1)$.</description>
