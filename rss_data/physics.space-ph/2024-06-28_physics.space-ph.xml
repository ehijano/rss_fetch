      <title>Neural Operator for Accelerating Coronal Magnetic Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the sun's outer atmosphere is challenging due to its complex magnetic fields impacting solar activities. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations help model these interactions but are extremely time-consuming (usually on a scale of days). Our research applies the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to accelerate the coronal magnetic field modeling, specifically, the Bifrost MHD model. We apply Tensorized FNO (TFNO) to generate solutions from partial differential equations (PDEs) over a 3D domain efficiently. TFNO's performance is compared with other deep learning methods, highlighting its accuracy and scalability. Physics analysis confirms that TFNO is reliable and capable of accelerating MHD simulations with high precision. This advancement improves efficiency in data handling, enhances predictive capabilities, and provides a better understanding of magnetic topologies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Heating and Parallel Heat Flux in Electron-only Magnetic Reconnection with Intense Guide Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-only reconnection is a process recently observed in the Earth's magnetosheath, where magnetic reconnection occurs at electron kinetic scales with only electrons involved. Electron-only reconnection is likely to have a significant impact on the energy conversion and dissipation of turbulence cascades at kinetic scales. This paper investigates electron-only reconnection under different intensities of strong guide fields via two-dimensional fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, focusing on electron heating. The simulations are initialized with a force-free current sheet equilibrium under various intensities of strong guide fields. The quadrupolar structures of the out-of-plane magnetic field and asymmetric structures of density are found to become narrower in space as the guide field increases. Electron velocities are considerably larger than ion velocities, and the motion of both species is notably affected by the strength of guide fields. Similarly to previous experiments studies, electron temperature anisotropy along separatrices is observed, which is found to be mainly caused by the variations of parallel temperature. Both regions of anisotropy and parallel temperature increase/decrease along separatrices become thinner with increasing guide fields. Besides, we find a transition from a quadrupolar to a six-polar to an eight-polar structure in temperature anisotropy and parallel temperature as the guide field intensifies. Non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) at different locations in the three simulations are observed. Our results show that parallel electron velocity varies notably with different guide field intensities and strong parallel electron heat flux is observed.</description>
