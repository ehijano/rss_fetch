      <title>LLMs Between the Nodes: Community Discovery Beyond Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model interactions to the specific structure of graph data.</description>

      <title>Constructing and Sampling Directed Graphs with Linearly Rescaled Degree Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, many large directed networks such as online social networks are collected with the help of powerful data engineering and data storage techniques. Analyses of such networks attract significant attention from both the academics and industries. However, analyses of large directed networks are often time-consuming and expensive because the complexities of a lot of graph algorithms are often polynomial with the size of the graph. Hence, sampling algorithms that can generate graphs preserving properties of original graph are of great importance because they can speed up the analysis process. We propose a promising framework to sample directed graphs: Construct a sample graph with linearly rescaled Joint Degree Matrix (JDM) and Degree Correlation Matrix (DCM). Previous work shows that graphs with the same JDM and DCM will have a range of very similar graph properties. We also conduct experiments on real-world datasets to show that the numbers of non-zero entries in JDM and DCM are quite small compared to the number of edges and nodes. Adopting this framework, we propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that can provably preserves in-degree and out-degree distributions, which are two most fundamental properties of a graph. We also prove the upper bound for deviations in the joint degree distribution and degree correlation distribution, which correspond to JDM and DCM. Besides, we prove that the deviations in these distributions are negatively correlated with the sparsity of the JDM and DCM. Considering that these two matrices are always quite sparse, we believe that proposed algorithm will have a better-than-theory performance on real-world large directed networks.</description>

      <title>Countering the Forgetting of Novel Health Information with 'Social Boosting'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the adverse effects of low-quality or false information, studies have shown the effectiveness of various intervention techniques through debunking or so-called pre-bunking. However, the effectiveness of such interventions can decay. Here, we investigate the role of the detailed social structure of the local villages within which the intervened individuals live, which provides opportunities for the targeted individuals to discuss and internalize new knowledge. We evaluated this with respect to a critically important topic, information about maternal and child health care, delivered via a 22-month in-home intervention. Specifically, we examined the effect of having friendship ties on the retention of knowledge interventions among targeted individuals in 110 isolated Honduran villages. We hypothesize that individuals who receive specific knowledge can internalize and consolidate this information by engaging in social interactions where, for instance, they have an opportunity to discuss it with others in the process. The opportunity to explain information to others (knowledge sharing) promotes deeper cognitive processing and elaborative encoding, which ultimately enhances memory retention. We found that well-connected individuals within a social network experience an enhanced effectiveness of knowledge interventions. These individuals may be more likely to internalize and retain the information and reinforce it in others, due to increased opportunities for social interaction where they teach others or learn from them, a mechanism we refer to as "social boosting". These findings underscore the role of social interactions in reinforcing health knowledge interventions over the long term. We believe these findings would be of interest to the health policy, the global health workforce, and healthcare professionals focusing on disadvantaged populations and UN missions on infodemics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Left-Wing Extremism on the Decentralized Web: An Analysis of Lemmygrad.ml</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the presence of left-wing extremism on the Lemmygrad.ml instance of the decentralized social media platform Lemmy, from its launch in 2019 up to a month after the bans of the subreddits r/GenZedong and r/GenZhou. We conduct a temporal analysis on Lemmygrad.ml's user activity, with also measuring the degree of highly abusive or hateful content. Furthermore, we explore the content of their posts using a transformer-based topic modeling approach. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in user activity and toxicity levels following the migration of these subreddits to Lemmygrad.ml. We also identify posts that support authoritarian regimes, endorse the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and feature anti-Zionist and antisemitic content. Overall, our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of political extremism within decentralized social networks and emphasize the necessity of analyzing both ends of the political spectrum in research.</description>

      <title>Predicting stock prices with ChatGPT-annotated Reddit sentiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends, exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.</description>

      <title>Protecting Vulnerable Voices: Synthetic Dataset Generation for Self-Disclosure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3 text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence, i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.</description>

      <title>MindVote: When AI Meets the Wild West of Social Media Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scalable tools for pilot testing, predicting public opinion distributions before deploying costly surveys. To serve as effective pilot testing tools, the performance of these LLMs is typically benchmarked against their ability to reproduce the outcomes of past structured surveys. This evaluation paradigm, however, is misaligned with the dynamic, context-rich social media environments where public opinion is increasingly formed and expressed. By design, surveys strip away the social, cultural, and temporal context that shapes public opinion, and LLM benchmarks built on this paradigm inherit these critical limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce MindVote, the first benchmark for public opinion distribution prediction grounded in authentic social media discourse. MindVote is constructed from 3,918 naturalistic polls sourced from Reddit and Weibo, spanning 23 topics and enriched with detailed annotations for platform, topical, and temporal context. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs. MindVote provides a robust, ecologically valid framework to move beyond survey-based evaluations and advance the development of more socially intelligent AI systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.</description>

      <title>Who's important? -- SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for Timeline Generation</title>

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online, tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article.</description>

      <title>Long-Time and Short-Time Dynamics in a Weighted-Median Opinion Model on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions eventually yield a consensus opinion; in others, they can lead to opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of ``echo chambers''. Consider a social network of individuals with continuous-valued scalar opinions, and suppose that they can change their opinions when they interact with each other. In many models of the opinion dynamics of individuals in a network, it is common for opinion updates to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. As an alternative, which may be more realistic in some situations, we study an opinion model with an opinion-update rule that depends on the weighted median of the opinions of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our median-update opinion model, we investigate how the final opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals. We numerically investigate its accuracy for short-time opinion dynamics on various networks.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>
