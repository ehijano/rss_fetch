      <title>Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning for Secure IIoT Defense Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent. We provide theoretical analysis, failure mode characterization, and release code for reproducibility.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a cutting-edge recommendation system utilizing agentic AI for KYC (Know Your Customer in the financial domain), and its evaluation across five distinct content verticals: Advertising (Ad), News, Gossip, Sharing (User-Generated Content), and Technology (Tech). The study compares the performance of four experimental groups, grouping by the intense usage of KYC, benchmarking them against the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) metric at truncation levels of $k=1$, $k=3$, and $k=5$. By synthesizing experimental data with theoretical frameworks and industry benchmarks from platforms such as Baidu and Xiaohongshu, this research provides insight by showing experimental results for engineering a large-scale agentic recommendation system.</description>

      <title>SCP: Accelerating Discovery with a Global Web of Autonomous Scientific Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.</description>

      <title>MaRCA: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Computation Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems face significant computational challenges due to growing model complexity and traffic scale, making efficient computation allocation critical for maximizing business revenue. Existing approaches typically simplify multi-stage computation resource allocation, neglecting inter-stage dependencies, thus limiting global optimality. In this paper, we propose MaRCA, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for end-to-end computation resource allocation in large-scale recommender systems. MaRCA models the stages of a recommender system as cooperative agents, using Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) to optimize revenue under computation resource constraints. We introduce an AutoBucket TestBench for accurate computation cost estimation, and a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Revenue-Cost Balancer to proactively forecast traffic loads and adjust the revenue-cost trade-off accordingly. Since its end-to-end deployment in the advertising pipeline of a leading global e-commerce platform in November 2024, MaRCA has consistently handled hundreds of billions of ad requests per day and has delivered a 16.67% revenue uplift using existing computation resources.</description>

      <title>BEDA: Belief Estimation as Probabilistic Constraints for Performing Strategic Dialogue Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Target Tracking using Cellular Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generalization of graph theory, to natively model such heterogeneous systems. While existing coordination sheaf frameworks focus on cooperative problems like consensus, this work extends them to the non-cooperative target-tracking problem. The tracking of multiple, unknown targets is formulated as a harmonic extension problem on a cellular sheaf, accommodating nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances for all agents. A decentralized control law is developed using the sheaf Laplacian, and a corresponding Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee tracking error convergence, with results validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Strategy Adaptation in Multi-Agent Environments with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities across mathematical, strategic, and linguistic tasks, yet little is known about how well they reason in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent scenarios, such as collaborative environments in which agents continuously adapt to each other's behavior, as in cooperative gameplay settings. In this paper, we bridge this gap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time adaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic principles such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed framework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate, communicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing conditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate contextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM capabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our method achieves up to a 26\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in high-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05 milliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion rates, and flexibility, illustrating that game-theoretic guidance integrated with real-time feedback enhances LLM performance, ultimately fostering more resilient and flexible strategic multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>One Step is Enough: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on One-Step Policy Optimization for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order dispatch is a critical task in ride-sharing systems with Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), directly influencing efficiency and profits. Recently, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution to this problem by decomposing the large state and action spaces among individual agents, effectively addressing the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) in transportation market, which is caused by the substantial number of vehicles, passengers, and orders. However, conventional MARL-based approaches heavily rely on accurate estimation of the value function, which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments. To address this issue, we propose two novel methods that bypass value function estimation, leveraging the homogeneous property of AV fleets. First, we draw an analogy between AV fleets and groups in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), adapting it to the order dispatch task. By replacing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline with the group average reward-to-go, GRPO eliminates critic estimation errors and reduces training bias. Inspired by this baseline replacement, we further propose One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO), demonstrating that the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step group rewards under a homogeneous fleet. Experiments on a real-world ride-hailing dataset show that both GRPO and OSPO achieve promising performance across all scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the number of served orders using simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks. Furthermore, OSPO outperforms GRPO in all scenarios, attributed to its elimination of bias caused by the bounded time horizon of GRPO. Our code, trained models, and processed data are provided at https://github.com/RS2002/OSPO .</description>

      <title>Triple-BERT: Do We Really Need MARL for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, face the intricate real-time challenge of bundling and matching passengers-each with distinct origins and destinations-to available vehicles, all while navigating significant system uncertainties. Due to the extensive observation space arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves approximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with a 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times. Our code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available at the repository https://github.com/RS2002/Triple-BERT .</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.</description>

      <title>KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</description>
