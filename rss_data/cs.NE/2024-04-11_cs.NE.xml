      <title>Evolving Genetic Programming Tree Models for Predicting the Mechanical Properties of Green Fibers for Better Biocomposite Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced modern technology and industrial sustainability theme have contributed implementing composite materials for various industrial applications. Green composites are among the desired alternatives for the green products. However, to properly control the performance of the green composites, predicting their constituents properties are of paramount importance. This work presents an innovative evolving genetic programming tree models for predicting the mechanical properties of natural fibers based upon several inherent chemical and physical properties. Cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and moisture contents as well as the Microfibrillar angle of various natural fibers were considered to establish the prediction models. A one-hold-out methodology was applied for training/testing phases. Robust models were developed to predict the tensile strength, Young's modulus, and the elongation at break properties of the natural fibers. It was revealed that Microfibrillar angle was dominant and capable of determining the ultimate tensile strength of the natural fibers by 44.7% comparable to other considered properties, while the impact of cellulose content in the model was only 35.6%. This in order would facilitate utilizing artificial intelligence in predicting the overall mechanical properties of natural fibers without experimental efforts and cost to enhance developing better green composite materials for various industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of Training Instance Selection on Automated Algorithm Selection Models for Numerical Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed MA-BBOB function generator provides a way to create numerical black-box benchmark problems based on the well-established BBOB suite. Initial studies on this generator highlighted its ability to smoothly transition between the component functions, both from a low-level landscape feature perspective, as well as with regard to algorithm performance. This suggests that MA-BBOB-generated functions can be an ideal testbed for automated machine learning methods, such as automated algorithm selection (AAS).
  In this paper, we generate 11800 functions in dimensions $d=2$ and $d=5$, respectively, and analyze the potential gains from AAS by studying performance complementarity within a set of eight algorithms. We combine this performance data with exploratory landscape features to create an AAS pipeline that we use to investigate how to efficiently select training sets within this space. We show that simply using the BBOB component functions for training yields poor test performance, while the ranking between uniformly chosen and diversity-based training sets strongly depends on the distribution of the test set.</description>

      <title>SiGNN: A Spike-induced Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of dynamic graph representation learning (DGRL), the efficient and comprehensive capture of temporal evolution within real-world networks is crucial. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), known as their temporal dynamics and low-power characteristic, offer an efficient solution for temporal processing in DGRL task. However, owing to the spike-based information encoding mechanism of SNNs, existing DGRL methods employed SNNs face limitations in their representational capacity. Given this issue, we propose a novel framework named Spike-induced Graph Neural Network (SiGNN) for learning enhanced spatialtemporal representations on dynamic graphs. In detail, a harmonious integration of SNNs and GNNs is achieved through an innovative Temporal Activation (TA) mechanism. Benefiting from the TA mechanism, SiGNN not only effectively exploits the temporal dynamics of SNNs but also adeptly circumvents the representational constraints imposed by the binary nature of spikes. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent adaptability of SNNs, we explore an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary patterns within dynamic graphs across multiple time granularities. This approach facilitates the acquisition of a multiscale temporal node representation.Extensive experiments on various real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SiGNN in the node classification task.</description>

      <title>AD-NEv++ : The multi-architecture neuroevolution-based multivariate anomaly detection framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection tools and methods enable key analytical capabilities in modern cyberphysical and sensor-based systems. Despite the fast-paced development in deep learning architectures for anomaly detection, model optimization for a given dataset is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Neuroevolution could be an effective and efficient solution to this problem, as a fully automated search method for learning optimal neural networks, supporting both gradient and non-gradient fine tuning. However, existing frameworks incorporating neuroevolution lack of support for new layers and architectures and are typically limited to convolutional and LSTM layers. In this paper we propose AD-NEv++, a three-stage neuroevolution-based method that synergically combines subspace evolution, model evolution, and fine-tuning. Our method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by optimizing the mutation operator in the neuroevolution process, while supporting a wide spectrum of neural layers, including attention, dense, and graph convolutional layers. Our extensive experimental evaluation was conducted with widely adopted multivariate anomaly detection benchmark datasets, and showed that the models generated by AD-NEv++ outperform well-known deep learning architectures and neuroevolution-based approaches for anomaly detection. Moreover, results show that AD-NEv++ can improve and outperform the state-of-the-art GNN (Graph Neural Networks) model architecture in all anomaly detection benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly parameterizing and learning gradients of functions has widespread significance, with specific applications in optimization, generative modeling, and optimal transport. This paper introduces gradient networks (GradNets): novel neural network architectures that parameterize gradients of various function classes. GradNets exhibit specialized architectural constraints that ensure correspondence to gradient functions. We provide a comprehensive GradNet design framework that includes methods for transforming GradNets into monotone gradient networks (mGradNets), which are guaranteed to represent gradients of convex functions. We establish the approximation capabilities of the proposed GradNet and mGradNet. Our results demonstrate that these networks universally approximate the gradients of (convex) functions. Furthermore, these networks can be customized to correspond to specific spaces of (monotone) gradient functions, including gradients of transformed sums of (convex) ridge functions. Our analysis leads to two distinct GradNet architectures, GradNet-C and GradNet-M, and we describe the corresponding monotone versions, mGradNet-C and mGradNet-M. Our empirical results show that these architectures offer efficient parameterizations and outperform popular methods in gradient field learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Ground-Space Communications via Evolutionary Multi-objective Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB)-based uplink communication paradigm for enabling ground-space direct communications. Specifically, DCB treats the terminals that are unable to establish efficient direct connections with the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as distributed antennas, forming a virtual antenna array to enhance the terminal-to-satellite uplink achievable rates and durations. However, such systems need multiple trade-off policies that variously balance the terminal-satellite uplink achievable rate, energy consumption of terminals, and satellite switching frequency to satisfy the scenario requirement changes. Thus, we perform a multi-objective optimization analysis and formulate a long-term optimization problem. To address availability in different terminal cluster scales, we reformulate this problem into an action space-reduced and universal multi-objective Markov decision process. Then, we propose an evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain the desirable policies, in which the low-value actions are masked to speed up the training process. As such, the applicability of a one-time trained model can cover more changing terminal-satellite uplink scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outmatches various baselines, and draw some useful insights. Specifically, it is found that DCB enables terminals that cannot reach the uplink achievable threshold to achieve efficient direct uplink transmission, which thus reveals that DCB is an effective solution for enabling direct ground-space communications. Moreover, it reveals that the proposed algorithm achieves multiple policies favoring different objectives and achieving near-optimal uplink achievable rates with low switching frequency.</description>

      <title>UAV-enabled Collaborative Beamforming via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assistant air-to-ground communication system, where multiple UAVs form a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (UVAA) to communicate with remote base stations by utilizing collaborative beamforming. To improve the work efficiency of the UVAA, we formulate a UAV-enabled collaborative beamforming multi-objective optimization problem (UCBMOP) to simultaneously maximize the transmission rate of the UVAA and minimize the energy consumption of all UAVs by optimizing the positions and excitation current weights of all UAVs. This problem is challenging because these two optimization objectives conflict with each other, and they are non-concave to the optimization variables. Moreover, the system is dynamic, and the cooperation among UAVs is complex, making traditional methods take much time to compute the optimization solution for a single task. In addition, as the task changes, the previously obtained solution will become obsolete and invalid. To handle these issues, we leverage the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to address the UCBMOP. Specifically, we use the heterogeneous-agent trust region policy optimization (HATRPO) as the basic framework, and then propose an improved HATRPO algorithm, namely HATRPO-UCB, where three techniques are introduced to enhance the performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can learn a better strategy compared with other methods. Moreover, extensive experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.</description>

      <title>Deep Multi-Threshold Spiking-UNet for Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: U-Net, known for its simple yet efficient architecture, is widely utilized for image processing tasks and is particularly suitable for deployment on neuromorphic chips. This paper introduces the novel concept of Spiking-UNet for image processing, which combines the power of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with the U-Net architecture. To achieve an efficient Spiking-UNet, we face two primary challenges: ensuring high-fidelity information propagation through the network via spikes and formulating an effective training strategy. To address the issue of information loss, we introduce multi-threshold spiking neurons, which improve the efficiency of information transmission within the Spiking-UNet. For the training strategy, we adopt a conversion and fine-tuning pipeline that leverage pre-trained U-Net models. During the conversion process, significant variability in data distribution across different parts is observed when utilizing skip connections. Therefore, we propose a connection-wise normalization method to prevent inaccurate firing rates. Furthermore, we adopt a flow-based training method to fine-tune the converted models, reducing time steps while preserving performance. Experimental results show that, on image segmentation and denoising, our Spiking-UNet achieves comparable performance to its non-spiking counterpart, surpassing existing SNN methods. Compared with the converted Spiking-UNet without fine-tuning, our Spiking-UNet reduces inference time by approximately 90\%. This research broadens the application scope of SNNs in image processing and is expected to inspire further exploration in the field of neuromorphic engineering. The code for our Spiking-UNet implementation is available at https://github.com/SNNresearch/Spiking-UNet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A lately created metaheuristic algorithm called Child Drawing Development Optimization (CDDO) has proven to be effective in a number of benchmark tests. A Binary Child Drawing Development Optimization (BCDDO) is suggested for choosing the wrapper features in this study. To achieve the best classification accuracy, a subset of crucial features is selected using the suggested BCDDO. The proposed feature selection technique's efficiency and effectiveness are assessed using the Harris Hawk, Grey Wolf, Salp, and Whale optimization algorithms. The suggested approach has significantly outperformed the previously discussed techniques in the area of feature selection to increase classification accuracy. Moderate COVID, breast cancer, and big COVID are the three datasets utilized in this study. The classification accuracy for each of the three datasets was (98.75, 98.83%, and 99.36) accordingly.</description>

      <title>Multi-Neuron Representations of Hierarchical Concepts in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how hierarchical concepts can be represented in three types of layered neural networks. The aim is to support recognition of the concepts when partial information about the concepts is presented, and also when some of the neurons in the network might fail. Our failure model involves initial random failures. The three types of networks are: feed-forward networks with high connectivity, feed-forward networks with low connectivity, and layered networks with low connectivity and with both forward edges and "lateral" edges within layers. In order to achieve fault-tolerance, the representations all use multiple representative neurons for each concept. We show how recognition can work in all three of these settings, and quantify how the probability of correct recognition depends on several parameters, including the number of representatives and the neuron failure probability. We also discuss how these representations might be learned, in all three types of networks. For the feed-forward networks, the learning algorithms are similar to ones used in [4], whereas for networks with lateral edges, the algorithms are generally inspired by work on the assembly calculus [3, 6, 7].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization has witnessed remarkable progress during the past decades. However, existing algorithms often encounter computational challenges in large-scale scenarios, primarily attributed to the absence of hardware acceleration. In response, we introduce a Tensorized Reference Vector Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (TensorRVEA) for harnessing the advancements of GPU acceleration. In TensorRVEA, the key data structures and operators are fully transformed into tensor forms for leveraging GPU-based parallel computing. In numerical benchmark tests involving large-scale populations and problem dimensions, TensorRVEA consistently demonstrates high computational performance, achieving up to over 1000$\times$ speedups. Then, we applied TensorRVEA to the domain of multiobjective neuroevolution for addressing complex challenges in robotic control tasks. Furthermore, we assessed TensorRVEA's extensibility by altering several tensorized reproduction operators. Experimental results demonstrate promising scalability and robustness of TensorRVEA.

      <description>arXiv:2404.01817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm has received considerable recognition in the field of neuroevolution. Its effectiveness is derived from initiating with simple networks and incrementally evolving both their topologies and weights. Although its capability across various challenges is evident, the algorithm's computational efficiency remains an impediment, limiting its scalability potential. In response, this paper introduces a tensorization method for the NEAT algorithm, enabling the transformation of its diverse network topologies and associated operations into uniformly shaped tensors for computation. This advancement facilitates the execution of the NEAT algorithm in a parallelized manner across the entire population. Furthermore, we develop TensorNEAT, a library that implements the tensorized NEAT algorithm and its variants, such as CPPN and HyperNEAT. Building upon JAX, TensorNEAT promotes efficient parallel computations via automated function vectorization and hardware acceleration. Moreover, the TensorNEAT library supports various benchmark environments including Gym, Brax, and gymnax. Through evaluations across a spectrum of robotics control environments in Brax, TensorNEAT achieves up to 500x speedups compared to the existing implementations such as NEAT-Python.

      <description>arXiv:2404.03838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider whether conditions exist under which block-coordinate descent is asymptotically efficient in evolutionary multi-objective optimization, addressing an open problem. Block-coordinate descent, where an optimization problem is decomposed into $k$ blocks of decision variables and each of the blocks is optimized (with the others fixed) in a sequence, is a technique used in some large-scale optimization problems such as airline scheduling, however its use in multi-objective optimization is less studied. We propose a block-coordinate version of GSEMO and compare its running time to the standard GSEMO algorithm. Theoretical and empirical results on a bi-objective test function, a variant of LOTZ, serve to demonstrate the existence of cases where block-coordinate descent is faster. The result may yield wider insights into this class of algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I introduce a novel associative memory model named Correlated Dense Associative Memory (CDAM), which integrates both auto- and hetero-association in a unified framework for continuous-valued memory patterns. Employing an arbitrary graph structure to semantically link memory patterns, CDAM is theoretically and numerically analysed, revealing four distinct dynamical modes: auto-association, narrow hetero-association, wide hetero-association, and neutral quiescence. Drawing inspiration from inhibitory modulation studies, I employ anti-Hebbian learning rules to control the range of hetero-association, extract multi-scale representations of community structures in graphs, and stabilise the recall of temporal sequences. Experimental demonstrations showcase CDAM's efficacy in handling real-world data, replicating a classical neuroscience experiment, performing image retrieval, and simulating arbitrary finite automata.</description>

Abstract: Humans and animals can recognize latent structures in their environment and apply this information to efficiently navigate the world. However, it remains unclear what aspects of neural activity contribute to these computational capabilities. Here, we develop an analytical theory linking the geometry of a neural population's activity to the generalization performance of a linear readout on a set of tasks that depend on a common latent structure. We show that four geometric measures of the activity determine performance across tasks. Using this theory, we find that experimentally observed disentangled representations naturally emerge as an optimal solution to the multi-task learning problem. When data is scarce, these optimal neural codes compress less informative latent variables, and when data is abundant, they expand these variables in the state space. We validate our theory using macaque ventral stream recordings. Our results therefore tie population geometry to multi-task learning.</description>
