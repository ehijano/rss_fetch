      <title>Spectral results for free random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A},\mathrm{tr})$ be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal trace $\mathrm{tr}:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}.$ For each $a\in\mathcal{A},$ define \[ S(\lambda,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[\log((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda )+\varepsilon)],\quad\lambda\in\mathbb{C},~\varepsilon&gt;0, \] so that the limit as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0^{+}$ of $S$ is the log potential of the Brown measure of $a.$ Suppose that for a fixed $\lambda\in\mathbb{C},$ the function% \[ \varepsilon\mapsto\frac{\partial S}{\partial\varepsilon}(\lambda ,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[\log((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda)+\varepsilon )^{-1}] \] admits a real analytic extension to a neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb{R}.$ Then we will show that $\lambda$ is outside the spectrum of $a.$
  We will apply this result to several examples involving circular and elliptic elements, as well as free multiplicative Brownian motions. In most cases, we will show that the spectrum of the relevant element $a$ coincides with the support of its Brown measure.</description>

      <title>On almost commuting unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A question going back to Halmos asks when two approximately commuting matrices of a certain kind are close to exactly commuting matrices of the same kind. It has long been known that there is a winding number obstruction for approximately commuting unitary matrices to be close, in a dimension-independent way, to genuinely commuting unitary matrices. In this paper, under the vanishing of the said obstruction, we obtain effective bounds for the distance to commuting unitary matrices in terms of the commutator of the original matrices.</description>

      <title>Free Independence is not Definable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free independence is an important tool for studying the structure of operator algebras. It is natural to ask from the model-theoretic standpoint whether free independence is captured well in first-order model theory via the notion of a definable set. We prove that pairs of freely independent elements do not form a definable set in the sense of continuous model theory, relative to the theory of both C$^*$-probability spaces and tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Multiplication Operator Semigroups on Banach lattice valued continuous function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and characterize, on the Banach lattice valued continuous function space, multiplication operators generating strongly continuous multiplication operator semigroups. Our characterization is the generalization of known results for the scalar-valued continuous functions $C_0(\Omega)$ vanishing at infinity, on a locally compact (Hausdorff) space $\Omega$, to Banach lattice $C_0(\Omega, E)$ of continuous Banach lattice $E$-valued functions vanishing at infinity.</description>

      <title>A solution to Haagerup's problem and positive Hahn-Banach separation theorems in operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We affirmatively resolve a question posed by Uffe Haagerup in 1975 on the positive version of the bipolar theorem on the dual spaces of C$^*$-algebras. As a direct consequence, we obtain a complete set of four positive Hahn-Banach separation theorems on von Neumann algebras, their preduals, C$^*$-algebras, and their duals. Furthermore, with the idea used to solve the problem, we simplify Haagerup's original solution to Dixmier's problem on normal weights.</description>

      <title>Real operator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operator systems are the unital self-adjoint subspaces of the bounded operators on a Hilbert space. Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. We uncover several notable differences between the real and complex theory, including the absence of minimal and maximal functors in the category of real operator systems. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject. In the final two sections of our paper we study real analogues of the Kirchberg conjectures (and of several important related problems that have attracted much interest recently), and study the deep relationships between them.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of reduced $C^*$-algebras associated with higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convex sets, the real case of the recent and profound complex theory developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their memoir. Later results will be discussed in future papers. We develop here some of the infrastructure of real nc convexity, giving many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated nc convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of (pre)liminary C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n &lt;\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha &lt;\omega _{1}$. We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta &lt;\alpha $, and a separable C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta &lt;\alpha $.</description>

      <title>On a comprehensive review of a proof of L\"owner's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in Kubo-Ando theory make frequent use of the relationship between Kubo-Ando connections and positive operator monotone functions. This relationship is deeply connected to L\"owner's theorem and our aim is to provide a comprehensive review of one of the proofs of L\"owner's theorem. Our motivation arises from the fact that the foundational components upon which the theorem rests are found within a variety of sources, rendering it difficult to obtain a complete understanding of the proof without engaging in substantial external consultation. By consolidating these elements into a single, continuous account, the proof becomes substantially more accessible and may be assimilated with greater clarity and efficiency.</description>
