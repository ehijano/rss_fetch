      <title>Prompt-guided Precise Audio Editing with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio editing involves the arbitrary manipulation of audio content through precise control. Although text-guided diffusion models have made significant advancements in text-to-audio generation, they still face challenges in finding a flexible and precise way to modify target events within an audio track. We present a novel approach, referred to as PPAE, which serves as a general module for diffusion models and enables precise audio editing. The editing is based on the input textual prompt only and is entirely training-free. We exploit the cross-attention maps of diffusion models to facilitate accurate local editing and employ a hierarchical local-global pipeline to ensure a smoother editing process. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method in various editing tasks.</description>

      <title>MUSE: Flexible Voiceprint Receptive Fields and Multi-Path Fusion Enhanced Taylor Transformer for U-Net-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a challenging task for speech enhancement. In this paper, we introduce Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) Transformer based U-net for Speech Enhancement (MUSE), a lightweight speech enhancement network built upon the Unet architecture. Our approach incorporates a novel Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) Transformer block, which integrates Deformable Embedding (DE) to enable flexible receptive fields for voiceprints. The MET Transformer is uniquely designed to fuse Channel and Spatial Attention (CSA) branches, facilitating channel information exchange and addressing spatial attention deficits within the Taylor-Transformer framework. Through extensive experiments conducted on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, we demonstrate that MUSE achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing both training and deployment costs, boasting a mere 0.51M parameters.</description>

      <title>Pitch-Aware RNN-T for Mandarin Chinese Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) systems, leveraging Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), face two main challenges in Mandarin Chinese: 1) The two-stage models create an information gap between the phoneme or tone classification stage and the MDD stage. 2) The scarcity of Mandarin MDD datasets limits model training. In this paper, we introduce a stateless RNN-T model for Mandarin MDD, utilizing HuBERT features with pitch embedding through a Pitch Fusion Block. Our model, trained solely on native speaker data, shows a 3% improvement in Phone Error Rate and a 7% increase in False Acceptance Rate over the state-of-the-art baseline in non-native scenarios</description>

      <title>PPPR: Portable Plug-in Prompt Refiner for Text to Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Audio (TTA) aims to generate audio that corresponds to the given text description, playing a crucial role in media production. The text descriptions in TTA datasets lack rich variations and diversity, resulting in a drop in TTA model performance when faced with complex text. To address this issue, we propose a method called Portable Plug-in Prompt Refiner, which utilizes rich knowledge about textual descriptions inherent in large language models to effectively enhance the robustness of TTA acoustic models without altering the acoustic training set. Furthermore, a Chain-of-Thought that mimics human verification is introduced to enhance the accuracy of audio descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of generated content in practical applications. The experiments show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art Inception Score (IS) of 8.72, surpassing AudioGen, AudioLDM and Tango.</description>

      <title>Speaker-Smoothed kNN Speaker Adaptation for End-to-End ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent improvements in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (E2E ASR) systems, the performance can degrade due to vocal characteristic mismatches between training and testing data, particularly with limited target speaker adaptation data. We propose a novel speaker adaptation approach Speaker-Smoothed kNN that leverages k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) retrieval techniques to improve model output by finding correctly pronounced tokens from its pre-built datastore during the decoding phase. Moreover, we utilize x-vector to dynamically adjust kNN interpolation parameters for data sparsity issue. This approach was validated using KeSpeech and MagicData corpora under in-domain and all-domain settings. Our method consistently performs comparably to fine-tuning without the associated performance degradation during speaker changes. Furthermore, in the all-domain setting, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing the CER in both single speaker and multi-speaker test scenarios.</description>

      <title>TraceableSpeech: Towards Proactively Traceable Text-to-Speech with Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various threats posed by the progress in text-to-speech (TTS) have prompted the need to reliably trace synthesized speech. However, contemporary approaches to this task involve adding watermarks to the audio separately after generation, a process that hurts both speech quality and watermark imperceptibility. In addition, these approaches are limited in robustness and flexibility. To address these problems, we propose TraceableSpeech, a novel TTS model that directly generates watermarked speech, improving watermark imperceptibility and speech quality. Furthermore, We design the frame-wise imprinting and extraction of watermarks, achieving higher robustness against resplicing attacks and temporal flexibility in operation. Experimental results show that TraceableSpeech outperforms the strong baseline where VALL-E or HiFicodec individually uses WavMark in watermark imperceptibility, speech quality and resilience against resplicing attacks. It also can apply to speech of various durations.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Brand New QiandaoEar22 Dataset for Specific Ship Identification Using Ship-Radiated Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target identification of ship-radiated noise is a crucial area in underwater target recognition. However, there is currently a lack of multi-target ship datasets that accurately represent real-world underwater acoustic conditions. To ntackle this issue, we release QiandaoEar22 \textemdash an underwater acoustic multi-target dataset, which can be download on https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/qiandaoear22. This dataset encompasses 9 hours and 28 minutes of real-world ship-radiated noise data and 21 hours and 58 minutes of background noise data. We demonstrate the availability of QiandaoEar22 by conducting an experiment of identifying specific ship from the multiple targets. Taking different features as the input and six deep learning networks as classifier, we evaluate the baseline performance of different methods. The experimental results reveal that identifying the specific target of UUV from others can achieve the optimal recognition accuracy of 97.78\%, and we find using spectrum and MFCC as feature inputs and DenseNet as the classifier can achieve better recognition performance. Our work not only establishes a benchmark for the dataset but helps the further development of innovative methods for the tasks of underwater acoustic target detection (UATD) and underwater acoustic target recognition(UATR).</description>

      <title>InaGVAD : a Challenging French TV and Radio Corpus Annotated for Speech Activity Detection and Speaker Gender Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InaGVAD is an audio corpus collected from 10 French radio and 18 TV channels categorized into 4 groups: generalist radio, music radio, news TV, and generalist TV. It contains 277 1-minute-long annotated recordings aimed at representing the acoustic diversity of French audiovisual programs and was primarily designed to build systems able to monitor men's and women's speaking time in media. inaGVAD is provided with Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Speaker Gender Segmentation (SGS) annotations extended with overlap, speaker traits (gender, age, voice quality), and 10 non-speech event categories. Annotation distributions are detailed for each channel category. This dataset is partitioned into a 1h development and a 3h37 test subset, allowing fair and reproducible system evaluation. A benchmark of 6 freely available VAD software is presented, showing diverse abilities based on channel and non-speech event categories. Two existing SGS systems are evaluated on the corpus and compared against a baseline X-vector transfer learning strategy, trained on the development subset. Results demonstrate that our proposal, trained on a single - but diverse - hour of data, achieved competitive SGS results. The entire inaGVAD package; including corpus, annotations, evaluation scripts, and baseline training code; is made freely accessible, fostering future advancement in the domain.</description>

      <title>Small-E: Small Language Model with Linear Attention for Efficient Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) powered by language models have showcased remarkable capabilities in achieving naturalness and zero-shot voice cloning. Notably, the decoder-only transformer is the prominent architecture in this domain. However, transformers face challenges stemming from their quadratic complexity in sequence length, impeding training on lengthy sequences and resource-constrained hardware. Moreover they lack specific inductive bias with regards to the monotonic nature of TTS alignments. In response, we propose to replace transformers with emerging recurrent architectures and introduce specialized cross-attention mechanisms for reducing repeating and skipping issues. Consequently our architecture can be efficiently trained on long samples and achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning against baselines of comparable size.</description>

      <title>To Distill or Not to Distill? On the Robustness of Robust Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arabic is known to present unique challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). On one hand, its rich linguistic diversity and wide range of dialects complicate the development of robust, inclusive models. On the other, current multilingual ASR models are compute-intensive and lack proper comprehensive evaluations. In light of these challenges, we distill knowledge from large teacher models into smaller student variants that are more efficient. We also introduce a novel human-annotated dataset covering five under-represented Arabic dialects for evaluation. We further evaluate both our models and existing SoTA multilingual models on both standard available benchmarks and our new dialectal data. Our best-distilled model's overall performance ($45.0$\% WER) surpasses that of a SoTA model twice its size (SeamlessM4T-large-v2, WER=$47.0$\%) and its teacher model (Whisper-large-v2, WER=$55.1$\%), and its average performance on our new dialectal data ($56.9$\% WER) outperforms all other models. To gain more insight into the poor performance of these models on dialectal data, we conduct an error analysis and report the main types of errors the different models tend to make. The GitHub repository for the project is available at \url{https://github.com/UBC-NLP/distill-whisper-ar}.</description>

      <title>Neural Codec-based Adversarial Sample Detection for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV), increasingly used in security-critical applications, faces vulnerabilities from rising adversarial attacks, with few effective defenses available. In this paper, we propose a neural codec-based adversarial sample detection method for ASV. The approach leverages the codec's ability to discard redundant perturbations and retain essential information. Specifically, we distinguish between genuine and adversarial samples by comparing ASV score differences between original and re-synthesized audio (by codec models). This comprehensive study explores all open-source neural codecs and their variant models for experiments. The Descript-audio-codec model stands out by delivering the highest detection rate among 15 neural codecs and surpassing seven prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection methods. Note that, our single-model method even outperforms a SOTA ensemble method by a large margin.</description>

      <title>What do MLLMs hear? Examining reasoning with text and sound components in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, notably in connecting ideas and adhering to logical rules to solve problems. These models have evolved to accommodate various data modalities, including sound and images, known as multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which are capable of describing images or sound recordings. Previous work has demonstrated that when the LLM component in MLLMs is frozen, the audio or visual encoder serves to caption the sound or image input facilitating text-based reasoning with the LLM component. We are interested in using the LLM's reasoning capabilities in order to facilitate classification. In this paper, we demonstrate through a captioning/classification experiment that an audio MLLM cannot fully leverage its LLM's text-based reasoning when generating audio captions. We also consider how this may be due to MLLMs separately representing auditory and textual information such that it severs the reasoning pathway from the LLM to the audio encoder.</description>

      <title>URGENT Challenge: Universality, Robustness, and Generalizability For Speech Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed significant advancements in deep learning-based speech enhancement (SE). However, most existing SE research has limitations on the coverage of SE sub-tasks, data diversity and amount, and evaluation metrics. To fill this gap and promote research toward universal SE, we establish a new SE challenge, named URGENT, to focus on the universality, robustness, and generalizability of SE. We aim to extend the SE definition to cover different sub-tasks to explore the limits of SE models, starting from denoising, dereverberation, bandwidth extension, and declipping. A novel framework is proposed to unify all these sub-tasks in a single model, allowing the use of all existing SE approaches. We collected public speech and noise data from different domains to construct diverse evaluation data. Finally, we discuss the insights gained from our preliminary baseline experiments based on both generative and discriminative SE methods with 12 curated metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most Zero-shot Multi-speaker TTS (ZS-TTS) systems support only a single language. Although models like YourTTS, VALL-E X, Mega-TTS 2, and Voicebox explored Multilingual ZS-TTS they are limited to just a few high/medium resource languages, limiting the applications of these models in most of the low/medium resource languages. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this issue by proposing and making publicly available the XTTS system. Our method builds upon the Tortoise model and adds several novel modifications to enable multilingual training, improve voice cloning, and enable faster training and inference. XTTS was trained in 16 languages and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in most of them.</description>

      <title>MA-AVT: Modality Alignment for Parameter-Efficient Audio-Visual Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision transformers have shown promise in parameter-efficient audio-visual learning without audio pre-training. However, few studies have investigated effective methods for aligning multimodal features in parameter-efficient audio-visual transformers. In this paper, we propose MA-AVT, a new parameter-efficient audio-visual transformer employing deep modality alignment for corresponding multimodal semantic features. Specifically, we introduce joint unimodal and multimodal token learning for aligning the two modalities with a frozen modality-shared transformer. This allows the model to learn separate representations for each modality, while also attending to the cross-modal relationships between them. In addition, unlike prior work that only aligns coarse features from the output of unimodal encoders, we introduce blockwise contrastive learning to align coarse-to-fine-grain hierarchical features throughout the encoding phase. Furthermore, to suppress the background features in each modality from foreground matched audio-visual features, we introduce a robust discriminative foreground mining scheme. Through extensive experiments on benchmark AVE, VGGSound, and CREMA-D datasets, we achieve considerable performance improvements over SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Time-Varying Linear Prediction in the Context of End-to-End Analysis-by-Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training the linear prediction (LP) operator end-to-end for audio synthesis in modern deep learning frameworks is slow due to its recursive formulation. In addition, frame-wise approximation as an acceleration method cannot generalise well to test time conditions where the LP is computed sample-wise. Efficient differentiable sample-wise LP for end-to-end training is the key to removing this barrier. We generalise the efficient time-invariant LP implementation from the GOLF vocoder to time-varying cases. Combining this with the classic source-filter model, we show that the improved GOLF learns LP coefficients and reconstructs the voice better than its frame-wise counterparts.

Abstract: Audio signals can reveal intimate details about a person's life, including their conversations, health status, emotions, location, and personal preferences. Unauthorized access or misuse of this information can have profound personal and social implications. In an era increasingly populated by devices capable of audio recording, safeguarding user privacy is a critical obligation. This work studies the ethical and privacy concerns in current audio classification systems. We discuss the challenges and research directions in designing privacy-preserving audio sensing systems. We propose privacy-preserving audio features that can be used to classify wide range of audio classes, while being privacy preserving.</description>

      <title>Rene: A Pre-trained Multi-modal Architecture for Auscultation of Respiratory Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared with invasive examinations that require tissue sampling, respiratory sound testing is a non-invasive examination method that is safer and easier for patients to accept. In this study, we introduce Rene, a pioneering large-scale model tailored for respiratory sound recognition. Rene has been rigorously fine-tuned with an extensive dataset featuring a broad array of respiratory audio samples, targeting disease detection, sound pattern classification, and event identification. Our innovative approach applies a pre-trained speech recognition model to process respiratory sounds, augmented with patient medical records. The resulting multi-modal deep-learning framework addresses interpretability and real-time diagnostic challenges that have hindered previous respiratory-focused models. Benchmark comparisons reveal that Rene significantly outperforms existing models, achieving improvements of 10.27%, 16.15%, 15.29%, and 18.90% in respiratory event detection and audio classification on the SPRSound database. Disease prediction accuracy on the ICBHI database improved by 23% over the baseline in both mean average and harmonic scores. Moreover, we have developed a real-time respiratory sound discrimination system utilizing the Rene architecture. Employing state-of-the-art Edge AI technology, this system enables rapid and accurate responses for respiratory sound auscultation(https://github.com/zpforlove/Rene).</description>

      <title>A Frame-based Attention Interpretation Method for Relevant Acoustic Feature Extraction in Long Speech Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection tools could help early screening of depression. Here, we address two issues that may hinder the clinical practicality of such tools: segment-level labelling noise and a lack of model interpretability. We propose a speech-level Audio Spectrogram Transformer to avoid segment-level labelling. We observe that the proposed model significantly outperforms a segment-level model, providing evidence for the presence of segment-level labelling noise in audio modality and the advantage of longer-duration speech analysis for depression detection. We introduce a frame-based attention interpretation method to extract acoustic features from prediction-relevant waveform signals for interpretation by clinicians. Through interpretation, we observe that the proposed model identifies reduced loudness and F0 as relevant signals of depression, which aligns with the speech characteristics of depressed patients documented in clinical studies.</description>

      <title>Harder or Different? Understanding Generalization of Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has highlighted a key issue in speech deepfake detection: models trained on one set of deepfakes perform poorly on others. The question arises: is this due to the continuously improving quality of Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, i.e., are newer DeepFakes just 'harder' to detect? Or, is it because deepfakes generated with one model are fundamentally different to those generated using another model? We answer this question by decomposing the performance gap between in-domain and out-of-domain test data into 'hardness' and 'difference' components. Experiments performed using ASVspoof databases indicate that the hardness component is practically negligible, with the performance gap being attributed primarily to the difference component. This has direct implications for real-world deepfake detection, highlighting that merely increasing model capacity, the currently-dominant research trend, may not effectively address the generalization challenge.</description>

      <title>Codec-SUPERB: An In-Depth Analysis of Sound Codec Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sound codec's dual roles in minimizing data transmission latency and serving as tokenizers underscore its critical importance. Recent years have witnessed significant developments in codec models. The ideal sound codec should preserve content, paralinguistics, speakers, and audio information. However, the question of which codec achieves optimal sound information preservation remains unanswered, as in different papers, models are evaluated on their selected experimental settings. This study introduces Codec-SUPERB, an acronym for Codec sound processing Universal PERformance Benchmark. It is an ecosystem designed to assess codec models across representative sound applications and signal-level metrics rooted in sound domain knowledge.Codec-SUPERB simplifies result sharing through an online leaderboard, promoting collaboration within a community-driven benchmark database, thereby stimulating new development cycles for codecs. Furthermore, we undertake an in-depth analysis to offer insights into codec models from both application and signal perspectives, diverging from previous codec papers mainly concentrating on signal-level comparisons. Finally, we will release codes, the leaderboard, and data to accelerate progress within the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Gull, a generative multifunctional audio codec. Gull is a general purpose neural audio compression and decompression model which can be applied to a wide range of tasks and applications such as real-time communication, audio super-resolution, and codec language models. The key components of Gull include (1) universal-sample-rate modeling via subband modeling schemes motivated by recent progress in audio source separation, (2) gain-shape representations motivated by traditional audio codecs, (3) improved residual vector quantization modules, (4) elastic decoder network that enables user-defined model size and complexity during inference time, (5) built-in ability for audio super-resolution without the increase of bitrate. We compare Gull with existing traditional and neural audio codecs and show that Gull is able to achieve on par or better performance across various sample rates, bitrates and model complexities in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>AudioSetMix: Enhancing Audio-Language Datasets with LLM-Assisted Augmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning in the audio-language domain has seen significant advancements in recent years. However, audio-language learning faces challenges due to limited and lower-quality data compared to image-language tasks. Existing audio-language datasets are notably smaller, and manual labeling is hindered by the need to listen to entire audio clips for accurate labeling.
  Our method systematically generates audio-caption pairs by augmenting audio clips with natural language labels and corresponding audio signal processing operations. Leveraging a Large Language Model, we generate descriptions of augmented audio clips with a prompt template. This scalable method produces AudioSetMix, a high-quality training dataset for text-and-audio related models.
  Integration of our dataset improves models performance on benchmarks by providing diversified and better-aligned examples. Notably, our dataset addresses the absence of modifiers (adjectives and adverbs) in existing datasets. By enabling models to learn these concepts, and generating hard negative examples during training, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</description>
