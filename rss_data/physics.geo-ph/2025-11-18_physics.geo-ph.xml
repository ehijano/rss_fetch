      <title>Determination of the National Highpoint of Botswana using GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Botswana has not previously been surveyed with sufficient accuracy to determine the highest peak in the country. Otse Hill and Monalanong Hill have been identified as the highest peaks, but there was uncertainty on which is highest. For this study, ground surveys were conducted on each of these peaks using an Abney level to identify the peak location and a GNSS unit to measure the elevation of each hill with sub-meter vertical accuracy. Monalanong Hill was measured to be 1.87m +/-0.02m taller than Otse hill, with an elevation of 1492.12m +/-0.01m (orthometric height, EGM2008 geoid, 95% confidence interval) above mean sea level (MSL). Otse Hill was measured to be 1490.25m +/-0.01m. Thus, Monalanong Hill is the highest hill in Botswana.</description>

      <title>LiDAR Accuracy on North American Mountain Summits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mountainous terrain is increasingly being measured and mapped by airplane-based LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) techniques, but the accuracy of these measurements in such topographically variable terrain is not well understood. For this study we measured 179 mountain summits with differential GNSS static surveys and compared summit elevation and location measurements to those measured by LiDAR in point cloud data sets. We measured summits in 13 US states (Washington, Idaho, Montana, Utah, California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Colorado, and Pennsylvania) and two Canadian provinces (British Columbia and Nova Scotia). Summits included icecapped peaks, open rocky peaks, and tree-covered peaks ranging in elevation from 490m to over 4000m. LiDAR-point-cloud-derived summit elevations and locations were computed using four different methods: manual processing, highest ground return, highest return, and Lastools reclassification. The average one-sigma LiDAR vertical errors for each method were 0.50m, 1.09m, 9.83m, and 1.96m, respectively. Average one-sigma horizontal errors were 3.03m, 2.41m, 5.17m, 3.78m, respectively. Errors are also presented separately for each type of summit. Error sources include sharp summits being unsampled, dense vegetation misclassified as ground, human-created structures misclassified as ground, snow/ice that can melt over time, and summit erosion over time.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ultra Rapid Data Assimilation Based on Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter with the Lorenz 96 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the effectiveness of ultra-rapid data assimilation (URDA) for numerical weather prediction (NWP), this study investigates the properties of URDA in nonlinear models and proposes technical treatments to enhance its performance. URDA rapidly updates preemptive forecasts derived from observations without integrating a dynamical model each time additional observations become available. First, we analytically demonstrate that the preemptive forecast obtained by URDA in nonlinear models is approximately equivalent to the forecast integrated from the analysis. Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted with the 40-variable Lorenz 96 model. The results show that URDA in nonlinear models tends to exhibit deterioration of forecast accuracy and collapse of ensemble spread when preemptive forecasts are repeatedly updated or when the forecasts are extended over longer periods. Furthermore, the roles of inflation and localization, both essential technical treatments in NWP, are examined in the context of URDA. It is shown that although inflation and localization are essential to URDA, conventional inflation techniques are not suitable for it. Therefore, this study proposes new technical treatments for URDA, namely relaxation to baseline perturbations (RTBP) and relaxation to baseline forecast (RTBF). Applying RTBP and RTBF mitigates the difficulties associated with URDA and yields preemptive forecasts with higher accuracy than the baseline forecast. Consequently, URDA, particularly when combined with RTBP and RTBF, would stand as a step toward practical application in NWP.</description>

      <title>Development of an Uncertainty Workflow to Support Landsat TIRS Split Window-Derived Surface Temperature Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Landsat Level 2 surface temperature products are derived using a single-channel (SC) methodology to estimate per-pixel surface temperature (ST) maps from Level~1 radiance data. A known issue with the Level 2 uncertainty, however, is its susceptibility to overestimation of uncertainty due to its dependence on Landsat's cloud mask, which is prone to false-positives. Beginning with Collection 3, the split window (SW) approach will serve as the surface temperature algorithm for the level-2 product, reflecting its adaptability across conditions which necessitates the development of a dedicated uncertainty workflow. We introduce an improved uncertainty workflow, based on a physical parameter called total precipitable water (TPW), that more adequately estimates the uncertainty associated with surface temperature estimates. We leveraged a SW algorithm for estimating surface temperature to drive the uncertainty methodology discussed here. First, considering Landsat is not equipped with the optical channels necessary for deriving TPW, we create an XGBoost-based machine learning pipeline that relates TIRS bands 10 &amp; 11 image radiance to TPW using the MODIS product as reference. The resulting modeling approach achieves a mean absolute error in estimating TPW of 0.54 [cm] and a coefficient of determination (R2) as high as 0.89. Secondly, we propose an improved (SW-based) uncertainty workflow that also uses standard error propagation but incorporates uncertainty as a function of TPW. Our work fills the gap in the operational surface temperature algorithms and their corresponding uncertainty workflow tailored for Landsat 8 and 9, and machine learning based models for predicting atmospheric water vapor using thermal infrared sensor bands on board Landsat 8 and 9.</description>

      <title>Role of partial stable stratification on the onset of rotating magnetoconvection with a uniform horizontal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore the combined effects of partial thermal stable stratification and magnetic back-reaction within Earth's tangent cylinder, we study the onset of magnetoconvection in an infinite plane layer subject to horizontal magnetic field imposed perpendicular to the rotation axis. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are considered to examine their influence on convective onset. A broad range of rotation rates and diffusivity ratios captures the effects of rotation and thermal-to-magnetic diffusivity contrast, while magnetic back-reaction is analyzed by varying the imposed magnetic field strength. To assess the impact of stratification on convection threshold and flow structure, we derive local scaling laws for critical onset parameters and compute penetration percentages to quantify convective intrusion into the stable layer. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in rotation-dominated regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, faster rotation enhances columnarity and intensifies stratification effects while delaying onset. Under strong magnetic fields, thicker rolls persist even at rapid rotation, with limited but noticeable penetration into the stable layer. Magnetic stabilization is more effective at low to moderate diffusivity ratios but weakens at high diffusivity ratio. Penetration decreases with stronger magnetic fields and rotation, especially under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weak stratification and magnetic regimes. These findings highlight the complex interplay among stratification, rotation, and magnetic field strength in setting the onset and structure of rotating convection relevant to planetary interiors.</description>

      <title>Role of partial stable stratification on the onset of rotating magnetoconvection with a uniform vertical field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the onset of rotating magnetoconvection under an axially imposed magnetic field in the presence of partial thermal stable stratification. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are analyzed across Ekman numbers $E = 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}$, and $10^{-5}$ (rotation rates) and Roberts numbers $q = 0.01, 1$ and $10$ (diffusivity ratios). Magnetic back-reaction is explored by varying the Elsasser number ($\Lambda$) from 0 to 10. Symmetry-breaking effects of stable layer are assessed via an asymmetry index. Additionally, local scaling laws are derived for onset parameters and convective penetration is quantified numerically. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in weak field regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, symmetry breaking is pronounced but weakens for strong field regime. Convective roll thickening peaks at $\Lambda = 1$, while columnarity persists in both weak and strong field regimes due to rotational constraints and elongation effects along imposed field direction, respectively. Magnetic stabilization is most effective at low to moderate values of $q$ but weakens in high $q$ regimes. Penetration depth is inversely related to the magnetic field strength and rotation rates, particularly under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weakly stratified cases. In the non-magnetic limit, the critical Ekman number $E_c$, exhibiting maximum penetration effects, is obtained as $E_c = 10^{-4}$ for weak stable stratification and $E_c = 10^{-3}$ for strong stable stratification. Obtained results can provide insights into the complex interplay of various geophysical effects on planetary interiors.</description>
