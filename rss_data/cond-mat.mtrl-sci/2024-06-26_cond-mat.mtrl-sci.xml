      <title>Machine learning the screening factor in the soft bond valence approach for rapid crystal structure estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of new functional ceramics is important for several applications, including electrochemical batteries and fuel cells. Computational prescreening and selection of such materials can help discover novel materials but is challenging due to the high cost of electronic structure calculations which would be needed to compute the structures and properties of interest such as the material's stability and ion diffusion properties. The soft bond valence (SoftBV) approach is attractive for rapid prescreening among multiple compositions and structures, but the simplicity of the approximation can make the results inaccurate. We explore the possibility of enhancing the accuracy of the SoftBV approach when estimating crystal structures by adapting the parameters of the approximation to the chemical composition. Specifically, on the examples of perovskite- and spinel-type oxides that have been proposed as promising solid-state ionic conductors, the screening factor, an independent parameter of the SoftBV approximation, is modeled using linear and non-linear methods as a function of descriptors of chemical composition. We find that making the screening factor a function of composition can noticeably improve the ability of SoftBV to correctly model structures, in particular new, putative crystal structures whose structural parameters are yet unknown. We also analyze the relative importance of nonlinearity and coupling in improving the model and find that while the quality of the model is improved by including nonlinearity, coupling is relatively unimportant. While using a neural network showed no improvement over linear regression, the recently proposed GPR-NN method that is a hybrid between a single hidden layer neural network and kernel regression showed substantial improvement, enabling the prediction of structural parameters of new ceramics with accuracy on the order of 1%.</description>

      <title>Enhancing and Mapping Thermal Boundary Conductance across Bonded Si/SiC Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SiC is a promising substrate for Si-on-insulator (SOI) wafers for efficient thermal management owing to its high thermal conductivity and large bandgap. However, fabricating a Si device layer on a SiC substrate with a high and uniform thermal-boundary conductance (TBC) at the wafer scale is challenging. In this study, a 4-inch Si-on-SiC wafer was fabricated using a room-temperature surface-activated bonding method, and the TBC was measured using the time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) method. The obtained TBC was 109 MW/m2K in the as-bonded sample, improving to 293 MW/m2K after annealing at 750 oC, representing a 78% increase compared to previously reported values for a Si-SiC interface formed by bonding methods. Such enhancement is attributed to the absence of an oxide layer at the interface. Furthermore, we assessed the actual spatial distribution of the TBC in the SOI system by combining the TDTR mapping with a mathematical model to remove the influence of random errors in the experiment. The spatial distributions before and after annealing were 7% and 17%, respectively. Such variation highlights the need to consider the TBC distribution when designing thermal management systems.</description>

      <title>MatText: Do Language Models Need More than Text &amp; Scale for Materials Modeling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively representing materials as text has the potential to leverage the vast advancements of large language models (LLMs) for discovering new materials. While LLMs have shown remarkable success in various domains, their application to materials science remains underexplored. A fundamental challenge is the lack of understanding of how to best utilize text-based representations for materials modeling. This challenge is further compounded by the absence of a comprehensive benchmark to rigorously evaluate the capabilities and limitations of these text representations in capturing the complexity of material systems. To address this gap, we propose MatText, a suite of benchmarking tools and datasets designed to systematically evaluate the performance of language models in modeling materials. MatText encompasses nine distinct text-based representations for material systems, including several novel representations. Each representation incorporates unique inductive biases that capture relevant information and integrate prior physical knowledge about materials. Additionally, MatText provides essential tools for training and benchmarking the performance of language models in the context of materials science. These tools include standardized dataset splits for each representation, probes for evaluating sensitivity to geometric factors, and tools for seamlessly converting crystal structures into text. Using MatText, we conduct an extensive analysis of the capabilities of language models in modeling materials. Our findings reveal that current language models consistently struggle to capture the geometric information crucial for materials modeling across all representations. Instead, these models tend to leverage local information, which is emphasized in some of our novel representations. Our analysis underscores MatText's ability to reveal shortcomings of text-based methods for materials design.</description>

      <title>Optical and X-ray Photo-emission Spectroscopies of Core/Shell Colloidal CdSe/CdS Quantum Dots: Modeling and Experimental Determination of Band Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical properties of multilayer semi-conductor nano-emitters are crucially dependent on the relative energy levelsof their different components. For core/shell quantum dots, the relative energy difference between conduction bandedge of core and shell materials induces, depending on its value, either a confinement of the electron within the coreor a delocalization of its wave function within the whole quantum dot. This results in drastic consequences on theenergy and the oscillator strength of the fundamental transition. Surprisingly, the literature currently lacks a definitivevalue for the energy difference between CdSe and CdS conduction band edges as most of the experimental studiesprovide values corresponding to specific geometries of quantum dots. Here, we develop a full theoretical modelexpressing energy levels considering core/shell interface pressure, ligands and enabling the accurate prediction ofthe bandgap value with the nanocrystal size. It allows to reliably determine the energy difference between theconduction band edge of CdSe and CdS materials, known as the conduction band offset, in such a way that this valuecan later be used to model quantum dots of any geometry. This value is determined using our model and two differentexperimental methods: optical spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission (XPS) experiments.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer in T/H heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ charge density wave state of the T polytype of MX$_2$ (M=Nb,Ta, X=S, Se) is known to host a half-filled flat band, which electronic correlations drive into a Mott insulating state. When T polytypes are coupled to strongly metallic H polytypes, such as in T/H bilayer heterostructures or the bulk 4H$_b$ polytype, charge transfer can destabilize the Mott state, but quantifying its magnitude has been a source of controversy. In this work, we perform a systematic ab-initio study of charge transfer for all experimentally relevant T/H bilayers and bulk 4H$_b$ structures. In all cases we find charge transfer from T to H layers which depends strongly on the interlayer distance but weakly on the Hubbard interaction. Additionally, Se compounds display smaller charge transfer than S compounds, and 4H$_b$ bulk polytypes display more charge transfer than isolated bilayers. We rationalize these findings in terms of band structure properties, and argue they might explain differences between compounds observed experimentally. Our work reveals the tendency to Mott insulation and the origin of superconductivity may vary significantly across the family of T/H heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Tuning the interlayer coupling in La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 / LaNiO3 multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ferromagnetic oxide epitaxial multilayers, magnetic properties and interlayer coupling are determined by a variety of factors. Beyond the contribution of interlayer exchange coupling, strain and interfacial effects, such as structural reconstructions or charge transfer, play significant roles, resulting in complex magnetic behaviour. In this study the interlayer coupling of ferromagnetic La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.95Ru0.05O3 (LSMRO) layers (8 nm thick) was investigated, when separated by epitaxial spacers of paramagnetic metallic LaNiO3 (LNO), in stacks exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. By varying the thickness of the spacer, it was found that the coupling between two LSMRO layers changes from antiferromagnetic (with a 4 unit cell thick LNO spacer) to ferromagnetic (with a 6 unit cells thick LNO spacer). For multilayers comprising five LSMRO layers and a 4 unit cell thick LNO spacer, the antiferromagnetic coupling was preserved. However, the effective magnetic anisotropy changed, causing the magnetization to cant more towards the in-plane direction. This behavior was corroborated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) investigations at the Mn and Ni L3-edges. The XMCD results indicated that the 4 unit cells thick LNO spacer in the multilayer become magnetically ordered, closely following the magnetization of adjacent LSMRO layers.</description>

      <title>Additively manufacturable high-strength aluminum alloys with thermally stable microstructures enabled by hybrid machine learning-based design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) structural components with complex geometries and tailored properties at voxel-size resolution will lead to significant leap in performance in various critical engineering applications. However, at each voxel, we first need to be able to design the alloy efficiently and reliably. We demonstrate a hybrid approach combining calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD)-based integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) with machine learning and inverse design techniques and performed a full alloy design cycle of a novel Al alloy (Al-Er-Zr-Y-Yb-Ni) for AM from virtual predictions to experimental validation. We designed this alloy to exhibit high tensile strength at room temperature through nanoscale L1$_2$-phase precipitation which stabilizes the microstructure to maintain strength after high-temperature aging. We initially exploit a fine distribution of metastable eutectic ternary phases through rapid solidification, which serve as the source for the reactive elements enabling nanoscale precipitation of a high phase fraction of the thermally stable L1$_2$ strengthening phases. The strength of the 3D-printed samples manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) from the designed composition is comparable to that of wrought Al 7075, and after high-temperature (400$^\circ$C) aging is 50% stronger than the best benchmark printable Al alloy1. The stable strengthening strategy is applicable to a wide range of alloys and rapid solidification processes, and our hybrid ML/CALPHAD numerical framework can be used for the efficient and robust design of alloy microstructures and properties, expanding the capabilities of additive as well as traditional manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Synthesis pathways to thin films of stable layered nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the grand challenges of materials chemistry is the selective synthesis of metastable materials away from equilibrium. Thin film deposition methods with rapid condensation of vapor precursors can readily synthesize metastable phases, but they often struggle to yield the thermodynamic ground state. How can thermodynamically-stable structures for practical applications be grown using kinetically-limited synthesis methods? Here, we reveal a synthesis pathway to thermodynamically-stable ordered layered ternary nitride materials, and we explain why disordered metastable intermediate phases tend to form in the first place. We show that starting from atomically dispersed vapor precursors leads to a 3D long-range disordered MgMoN2 thin film polymorph product, with a layered short-range order that has a low-energy transformation barrier to the layered 2D-like stable structure. We extend this synthesis approach to ScTaN2, MgWN2 and MgTa2N3, opening a door to synthesis of other layered nitride thin films with unique semiconducting and quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Topological Bimerons in Monolayer CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rich and fascinating physics of topological spin textures in van der Waals two-dimensional magnets has motivated recent growing interests, though a comprehensive understanding remains elusive. Here, in atomistic simulations on monolayer CrSBr, we find two magnetic phases emerging under non-equilibrium conditions at distinct temperatures, a standard ferromagnetic transition Tc and a lower temperature T*. Moreover, the real-space analysis of the spin texture reveals the emergence of metastable topological bimeron defects below T*, showing an algebraic-like decaying spin-spin correlation function. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, induced by the local site asymmetry in the centrosymmetric CrSBr monolayer, is proved to be the origin of the bimerons formation. Furthermore, the increasing bimerons density upon increasing the cooling rate follows a Kibble-Zurek behavior, suggesting a handle to drive and control topological bimerons below T*. Our results put forward CrSBr as an important candidate for the investigation of the dynamical behavior of bimerons in vdW magnets.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and improving the predictive accuracy of mixing enthalpies and volumes in disordered alloys from universal pre-trained machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of machine learning in materials science opens the way for exciting and ambitious simulations of large systems and long time scales with the accuracy of ab-initio calculations. Recently, several pre-trained universal machine learned interatomic potentials (UPMLIPs) have been published, i.e., potentials distributed with a single set of weights trained to target systems across a very wide range of chemistries and atomic arrangements. These potentials raise the hope of reducing the computational cost and methodological complexity of performing simulations compared to models that require for-purpose training. However, the application of these models needs critical evaluation to assess their usability across material types and properties. In this work, we investigate the application of the following UPMLIPs: MACE, CHGNET, and M3GNET to the context of alloy theory. We calculate the mixing enthalpies and volumes of 21 binary alloy systems and compare the results with DFT calculations to assess the performance of these potentials over different properties and types of materials. We find that small relative energies necessary to correctly predict mixing energies are generally not reproduced by these methods with sufficient accuracy to describe correct mixing behaviors. However, the performance can be significantly improved by supplementing the training data with relevant training data. The potentials can also be used to partially accelerate these calculations by replacing the ab-initio structural relaxation step.</description>

      <title>Robust and effective ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on the GPU cloud infrastructure using the Schr\"odinger Materials Science Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a valuable method for simulating physico-chemical processes of complex systems, including reactive systems, and for training machine learning models and force fields. Speed and stability issues on traditional hardware preclude routine AIMD simulations for larger systems and longer timescales. We postulate that any practically useful AIMD simulation must generate a trajectory of a minimum 1000 MD steps a day on a moderate cloud resource. In this work, we implement a computing workflow that enables routine calculations at this throughput and demonstrate results for several non-trivial atomistic dynamical systems. In particular, we have employed the GPU implementation of the Quantum ESPRESSO code which we will show increases AIMD productivity compared to the CPU version. In order to take advantage of transient servers (which are more cost and energy effective compared to the stable servers), we have implemented automatic restart/continuation of the AIMD runs within the Schr\"odinger Materials Science Suite. Finally, to reduce simulation size and thus reduce compute time when modeling surfaces, we have implemented a wall potential constraint. Our benchmarks using several reactive systems (lithium anode surface/solvent interface, hydrogen diffusion in an iron grain boundary) show a significant speed up when running on a GPU-enabled transient server using our updated implementation.</description>

      <title>Low Excess Noise, High Quantum Efficiency Avalanche Photodiodes for Beyond 2 {\mu}m Wavelength Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, notably CH4 and CO2, has fueled global temperature increases, intensifying concerns regarding the prevailing climate crisis. Effectively monitoring these gases demands a detector spanning the extended short-wavelength infrared (~2.4 {\mu}m) range, covering wavelengths of CH4 (1.65 {\mu}m) and CO2 (2.05 {\mu}m). The state-of-the-art HgCdTe avalanche photodetectors (APDs) offer exceptional performance metrics, including high gain (M) and low excess noise (F). However, their widespread adoption is hindered by inherent challenges such as manufacturability, reproducibility, and cost factors. Moreover, their reliance on cryogenic cooling adds to the cost, size, weight, and power of the system. We have demonstrated a linear mode APD combining an InGaAs/GaAsSb type-II superlattice absorber and an AlGaAsSb multiplier lattice matched to InP substrates. This APD has demonstrated a room temperature M of 178, a maximum measurable external quantum efficiency of 3560 % at 2 {\mu}m, an extremely low excess noise (F &lt; 2 at M &lt; 20), and a small temperature coefficient of breakdown (7.58 mV/K {\mu}m). Such a high performance APD with manufacturable semiconductor materials could lead to a rapid transition to a commercial III-V foundry, holding the promise of revolutionizing high-sensitivity receivers for greenhouse gas monitoring.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e lattice of twisted bilayer graphene as template for non-covalent functionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to achieve spatial variations in the degree of non-covalent functionalization of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). The tBLG with twist angles varying between ~ 5{\deg} and 7{\deg} was non-covalently functionalized with 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN) molecules. Our results show a correlation between the degree of functionalization and the twist angle of tBLG. This correlation was determined through Raman spectroscopy, where areas with larger twist angles exhibited a lower HATCN peak intensity compared to areas with smaller twist angles. We suggest that the HATCN adsorption follows the moir\'e pattern of tBLG by avoiding AA-stacked areas and attach predominantly to areas with a local AB-stacking order of tBLG, forming an overall ABA-stacking configuration. This is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our work highlights the role of the moir\'e lattice in controlling the non-covalent functionalization of tBLG. Our approach can be generalized for designing nanoscale patterns on two-dimensional (2D) materials using moir\'e structures as a template.</description>

      <title>Density-Based Long-Range Electrostatic Descriptors for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a long-range descriptor for machine learning force fields (MLFFs) that maintains translational and rotational symmetry, similar to short-range descriptors while being able to incorporate long-range electrostatic interactions. The proposed descriptor is based on an atomic density representation and is structurally similar to classical short-range atom-centered descriptors, making it straightforward to integrate into machine learning schemes. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through comparative analysis with the long-distance equivariant (LODE) descriptor. In a toy model with purely electrostatic interactions, our model achieves errors below 0.1%. The application of our descriptors, in combination with local descriptors representing the atomic density, to materials where monopole-monopole interactions are important such as sodium chloride successfully captures long-range interactions, improving predictive accuracy. The study highlights the limitations of the combined LODE method in materials where intermediate-range effects play a significant role. Our work presents a promising approach to addressing the challenge of incorporating long-range interactions into MLFFs, which enhances predictive accuracy for charged materials to the level of state-of-the-art Message Passing Neural Networks.</description>

      <title>Cluster-glass behaviour and large magnetocaloric effect in frustrated hyperkagome ferromagnet Li$_2$MgMn$_3$O$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed study of the structural and magnetic properties of the spin-$3/2$ hyperkagome lattice compound Li$_2$MgMn$_3$O$_8$ is reported. This material shows ferromagnetic response below $T_{\rm C} \simeq 20.6$ K, the temperature almost three times lower than the Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{\rm CW} \simeq 56.6$ K. Density-functional band-structure calculations suggest that this reduction in $T_{\rm C}$ may be caused by long-range antiferromagnetic couplings that frustrate nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings on the hyperkagome lattice. Large magnetocaloric effect is observed around the $T_{\rm C}$ with a maximum value of isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_{\rm m}\simeq 20$ J/kg-K and a maximum relative cooling power of $RCP\simeq 840$ J/kg for the 7 T magnetic field change. Critical analysis of the magnetization data and scaling analysis of the magnetocaloric effect suggest the 3D Heisenberg/XY universality class of the transition. The DC and AC magnetization measurements further reveal glassy nature of the ferromagnetic transition. A detailed study of the non-equilibrium dynamics via magnetic relaxation and memory effect measurements demonstrates that the system evolves through a large number of intermediate metastable states and manifests significant memory effect in the cluster-glass state.</description>

      <title>Understanding phase transitions of $\alpha$-quartz under dynamic compression conditions by machine-learning driven atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic shock effects in silica serve as a key indicator of historical impacts at geological sites. Despite this geological significance, atomistic details of structural transformations under high pressure and shock compression remain poorly understood. This ambiguity is evidenced by conflicting experimental observations of both amorphization and crystallization transitions. Utilizing a newly developed machine-learning interatomic potential, we examine the response of $\alpha$-quartz to shock compression with a peak pressure of 60 GPa over nano-second timescales. We initially observe amorphization before recrystallization into a d-NiAs-structured silica with disorder on the silicon sublattice, accompanied by the formation of domains with partial order of silicon. Investigating a variety of strain conditions enables us to identify the non-hydrostatic stress and strain states that allow the direct diffusionless formation of rosiaite-structured silica.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient real space formalism for hybrid exchange-correlation functionals in generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). In particular, we develop an efficient representation for any function of the real space finite-difference Laplacian matrix by leveraging its Kronecker product structure, thereby enabling the time to solution of associated linear systems to be highly competitive with the fast Fourier transform scheme, while not imposing any restrictions on the boundary conditions. We implement this formalism for both the unscreened and range-separated variants of hybrid functionals. We verify its accuracy and efficiency through comparisons with established planewave codes for isolated as well as bulk systems. In particular, we demonstrate up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in time to solution for the real space method. We also apply the framework to study the structure of liquid water using ab initio molecular dynamics, where we find good agreement with literature. Overall, the current formalism provides an avenue for efficient real space DFT calculations with hybrid density functionals.</description>

      <title>One-step synthesis of Cu-doped Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ apatite: A wide-gap semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent claim of potential room-temperature superconductivity in Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_{x}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O has attracted widespread attention. However, the signature of superconductivity is later attributed to the Cu$_{2}$S impurity formed during the multiple-step synthesis procedure. Here we report a simple one-step approach to synthesize single-phase chloride analogue Cu-doped Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ using PbO, PbCl$_{2}$, CuCl$_{2}$, and NH$_{4}$H$_{2}$PO$_{4}$ as starting materials. Irrespective of the initial stoichiometry, the Cu doping always leads to a lattice expansion in Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$. This indicates that Cu prefers to reside in the hexagonal channels rather than substitutes at the Pb site, and the chemical formula is expressed as Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cu$_{x}$Cl$_{2}$. All the Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$Cu$_{x}$Cl$_{2}$ (0 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1.0) samples are found to be semiconductors with wide band gaps of 4.46-4.59 eV, and the Cu-doped ones ($x$ = 0.5 and 1.0) exhibit a paramagnetic behavior without any phase transition between 400 and 1.8 K. Our study calls for a reinvestigation of the Cu location in Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_{x}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O, and supports the absence of superconductivity in this oxyapatite.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond Laser Annealing: impact on superconducting Silicon on Insulator epilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present superconducting monocrystalline Silicon On Insulator thin 33 nm epilayers. They are obtained by nanosecond laser annealing under ultra-high vacuum on 300 mm wafers heavily pre-implantated with boron ($2.5\times \,10^{16}\, at/cm^2$, 3 keV). Superconductivity is discussed in relation to the structural, electrical and material properties, a step towards the integration of ultra-doped superconducting Si at large scale. In particular, we highlight the effect of the nanosecond laser annealing energy and the impact of multiple laser anneals. Increasing the energy leads to a linear increase of the layer thickness, and to the increase of the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ from zero ($&lt;35\, mK$) to $0.5\,K$. This value is comparable to superconducting Si layers realised by Gas Immersion Laser Doping where the dopants are incorporated without introducing the deep defects associated to implantation. Superconductivity only appears when the annealed depth is larger than the initial amorphous layer induced by the boron implantation. The number of subsequent anneals results in a more homogeneous doping with reduced amount of structural defects and increased conductivity. The quantitative analysis of $T_c$ concludes on a superconducting/ non superconducting bilayer, with an extremely low resistance interface. This highlights the possibility to couple efficiently superconducting Si to Si channels.</description>

Abstract: The combination of deep learning and ab initio materials calculations is emerging as a trending frontier of materials science research, with deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure being particularly promising. In this work, we introduce a neural-network method for modeling the DFT density matrix, a fundamental yet previously unexplored quantity in deep-learning electronic structure. Utilizing an advanced neural network framework that leverages the nearsightedness and equivariance properties of the density matrix, the method demonstrates high accuracy and excellent generalizability in multiple example studies, as well as capability to precisely predict charge density and reproduce other electronic structure properties. Given the pivotal role of the density matrix in DFT as well as other computational methods, the current research introduces a novel approach to the deep-learning study of electronic structure properties, opening up new opportunities for deep-learning enhanced computational materials study.</description>

      <title>PANDA: A self-driving lab for studying electrodeposited polymer films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the polymer analysis and discovery array (PANDA), an automated system for high-throughput electrodeposition and functional characterization of polymer films. The PANDA is a custom, modular, and low-cost system based on a CNC gantry that we have modified to include a syringe pump, potentiostat, and camera with a telecentric lens. This system can perform fluid handling, electrochemistry, and transmission optical measurements on samples in custom 96-well plates that feature transparent and conducting bottoms. We begin by validating this platform through a series of control fluid handling and electrochemistry experiments to quantify the repeatability, lack of cross-contamination, and accuracy of the system. As a proof-of-concept experimental campaign to study the functional properties of a model polymer film, we optimize the electrochromic switching of electrodeposited poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films. In particular, we explore the monomer concentration, deposition time, and deposition voltage using an array of experiments selected by Latin hypercube sampling. Subsequently, we run an active learning campaign based upon Bayesian optimization to find the processing conditions that lead to the highest electrochromic switching of PEDOT:PSS. This self-driving lab integrates optical and electrochemical characterization to constitute a novel, automated approach for studying functional polymer films.</description>

      <title>Accurate polymorphous description of the paramagnetic phases in MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.02539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature-driven phase transition is a long-standing frontier in material science, among which the most common phenomenon is the transition from a low-temperature magnetic-ordered phase to a high-temperature paramagnetic phase. A paramount question is if such a paramagnetic phase of the 'correlated solids' can be well described by single-particle band theory to facilitate the experimental observations. In this work, we investigate the electronic properties of the paramagnetic phase by the static density functional theory via two different approaches, namely monomorphous description and polymorphous description. In the conventional monomorphous description, the local spin moments are naively forced to be zero. By contrast, the polymorphous description based on a large enough supercell with disordered distributed local moments is able to count in the effects of distinct local environments, providing a more reliable paramagnetic electronic structure to simulate realistic materials. From a comparison of total energies, symmetries, and band structures, we demonstrate the necessity for a proper treatment of paramagnetic phases, taking MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ as an example. Our work provides a theoretical perspective on the evolution of electronic structures through magnetic order-disorder phase transitions in emergent topological magnets.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Electronic Stopping Power Predictions by 10 Million Times with a Combination of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing the rate at which particle radiation releases energy in a material, the stopping power, is key to designing nuclear reactors, medical treatments, semiconductor and quantum materials, and many other technologies. While the nuclear contribution to stopping power, i.e., elastic scattering between atoms, is well understood in the literature, the route for gathering data on the electronic contribution has for decades remained costly and reliant on many simplifying assumptions, including that materials are isotropic. We establish a method that combines time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and machine learning to reduce the time to assess new materials to mere hours on a supercomputer and provides valuable data on how atomic details influence electronic stopping. Our approach uses TDDFT to compute the electronic stopping contributions to stopping power from first principles in several directions and then machine learning to interpolate to other directions at a cost of 10 million times fewer core-hours. We demonstrate the combined approach in a study of proton irradiation in aluminum and employ it to predict how the depth of maximum energy deposition, the "Bragg Peak," varies depending on incident angle -- a quantity otherwise inaccessible to modelers. The lack of any experimental information requirement makes our method applicable to most materials, and its speed makes it a prime candidate for enabling quantum-to-continuum models of radiation damage. The prospect of reusing valuable TDDFT data for training the model make our approach appealing for applications in the age of materials data science.</description>

      <title>Effects of W alloying on the electronic structure, phase stability and thermoelectric power factor in epitaxial CrN thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CrN-based alloy thin films are of interest as thermoelectric materials for energy harvesting. Ab initio calculations show that dilute alloying of CrN with 3 at.% W substituting Cr, induce flat electronic bands and push the Fermi level EF into the conduction band, while retaining dispersive Cr 3d bands. These features are conducive for both high electrical conductivity \sigma and high Seebeck coefficient \alpha, and hence the thermoelectric power factor {\alpha}^2\sigma. To investigate this possibility, epitaxial CrWxNz films were grown on c-plane sapphire by dc-magnetron sputtering. However, even films with the lowest W concentration (x = 0.03) in our study contained metallic h-Cr2N, which is not conducive for a high \alpha. Nevertheless, the films exhibit a sizeable power factor of {\alpha}^2\sigma ~ 4.7 x 10-4 Wm-1K-2 due to high \sigma ~ 700 Scm-1, and a moderate \alpha ~ -25 ~{^^^^00b5}V/K. Increasing h-Cr2N fractions in the 0.03 &lt; x \le 0.19 range monotonically increases \sigma, but severely diminishes \alpha leading to two orders of magnitude decrease in {\alpha}^2\sigma. This trend continues with x &gt; 0.19 due to W precipitation. These findings indicate that dilute W additions below its solubility limit in CrN is important for realizing high thermoelectric power factor in CrWxNz alloy films.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the strong, phonon-induced Urbach tails in \b{eta}-Ga2O3 and their implications on electrical breakdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) nitride and oxide semiconductors, increased bandgap (Eg) correlates with greater ionicity and strong electron-phonon coupling. This limits mobility through polar optical phonon scattering, localizes carriers via polarons and self-trapping, broadens optical transitions via dynamic disorder, and modifies the breakdown field. Herein, we use polarized optical transmission spectroscopy from 77-633 K to investigate the Urbach energy (Eu) for many orientations of Fe- and Sn-doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 bulk crystals. We find Eu values ranging from 60-140 meV at 293 K and static (structural defects plus zero-point phonons) disorder contributes more to Eu than dynamic (finite temperature phonon-induced) disorder. This is evidenced by lack of systematic Eu anisotropy, and Eu correlating more with X-ray diffraction rocking-curve broadening than with Sn-doping. The lowest measured Eu are ~10x larger than for traditional semiconductors, pointing out that band tail effects need to be carefully considered in these materials for high field electronics. We demonstrate that, because optical transmission through thick samples is sensitive to sub-gap absorption, the commonly-used Tauc extraction of bandgap from transmission through Ga2O3 greater than 1-3 micro meter thick is subject to errors. Combining our Eu(T) from Fe-doped samples with Eg(T) from ellipsometry, we extract a measure of an effective electron-phonon coupling indicating increases in weighted 2nd order deformation potential with temperature and a larger value for E parallel b than E parallel c. The large electron-phonon coupling in beta-Ga2O3 suggests that theories of electrical breakdown for traditional semiconductors need expansion to account not just for lower scattering time but also for impact ionization thresholds fluctuating in both time and space.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of chemistry and materials science. Recent examples of LLM-accelerated experimental research include virtual assistants for parsing synthesis recipes from the literature, or using the extracted knowledge to guide synthesis and characterization. Despite these advancements, their application is constrained to labs with automated instruments and control software, leaving much of materials science reliant on manual processes. Here, we demonstrate the rapid deployment of a Python-based control module for a Keithley 2400 electrical source measure unit using ChatGPT-4. Through iterative refinement, we achieved effective instrument management with minimal human intervention. Additionally, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was created, effectively linking all instrument controls to interactive screen elements. Finally, we integrated this AI-crafted instrument control software with a high-performance stochastic optimization algorithm to facilitate rapid and automated extraction of electronic device parameters related to semiconductor charge transport mechanisms from current-voltage (IV) measurement data. This integration resulted in a comprehensive open-source toolkit for semiconductor device characterization and analysis using IV curve measurements. We demonstrate the application of these tools by acquiring, analyzing, and parameterizing IV data from a Pt/Cr$_2$O$_3$:Mg/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterojunction diode, a novel stack for high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. This approach underscores the powerful synergy between LLMs and the development of instruments for scientific inquiry, showcasing a path for further acceleration in materials science.</description>

      <title>Quench Risk Increase With Irradiation Damage</title>

Abstract: Superconducting material enables fusion reactor magnet concepts to operate with current densities that would melt materials with non-zero resistance. The application of superconducting material is considered essential for net-positive power machines. Catastrophic damage can occur when superconductivity is lost and the current generates heat. This scenario is called a quench. Stabilizer material carries the magnet current (typically copper) during a quench and is the focus of this work. Irradiation-induced defects store energy in the Cu crystalline lattice. The release of stored energy in the magnet materials, combined with the associated magnet material property changes, can cause extreme off-normal events in superconducting magnets that worsen with fluence at an increasing rate. Stored energy can be released causing local heating and increasing the risk of a quench. For example, following irradiation at 4.6K and an estimated fluence of 0.45*10^18 n/cm^2, an energy release of 0.023 J/g was measured from Cu when increased in temperature from 10K to 18K, which would have been enough energy to create the same temperature increase spontaneously. Extrapolations of experimental data are used to estimate when spontaneous heating can occur due to the release of energy stored in irradiation-induced defects. Critical fluence values are estimated between 1.74*10^18 n/cm^2 and 2.85*10^19 n/cm^2 for neutron irradiation of Cu at a temperature of 20K. High-temperature ramp rate in-situ cryogenic calorimetry experiments of magnet materials following irradiation would provide more clarity to designers of fusion magnet systems. Due to the increased quench risk with superconducting magnet dose, magnetic confinement reactor designers should consider the frequency of maintenance temperature cycles to maintain an appropriate level of risk during operation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic surface polaritons at isotropic-uniaxial interface: an exact algebraic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface polaritons in an anisotropic media posses a strong dependence of the wavevector on the propagation direction, which is called the isofrequency contour. This can lead to the fact that polariton propagation is possible only in a limited range of angles in the boundary plane. Notable examples are Dyakonov surface waves at the boundary of two dielectrics and hyperbolic plasmons in a hyperbolic metamaterial. Exact closed-form solutions of the polariton dispersion equation are known only in special cases: in a weakly anisotropic medium, and in an arbitrary medium for highly symmetric directions of polariton propagation. This work provides an universal exact solution in algebraic form for surface polariton at the interface of an arbitrary isotropic and an uniaxial media for the case of the optic axis parallel to the boundary. As an example, it is used to analyze the shapes of isofrequency contours of surface polaritons. The work brings together previously scattered results of studies on surface polaritons of various types in uniaxial media. In addition to the cases already considered in the literature, a solution for surface polaritons at the boundary of a isotropic metal and a Type I hyperbolic medium is found. The case of "elliptic" polaritons at the boundary of an anisotropic metal-like medium is apparently analyzed here for the first time.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Spherical Bloch Hyper-spheres from Quantum Matrix Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting analogies between the precessing quantum spin system and the charge-monopole system, we construct Bloch hyper-spheres with $\it{exact}$ spherical symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. Such Bloch hyper-spheres are realized as a collection of the orbits of a precessing quantum spin. The geometry of Bloch hyper-spheres is exactly equal to the quantum Nambu geometry of higher dimensional fuzzy spheres. The stabilizer group symmetry of the Bloch hyper-sphere necessarily introduces degenerate spin-coherent states, giving rise to the Wilczek-Zee geometric phase of non-Abelian monopoles associated with the hyper-sphere holonomy. The degenerate spin-coherent states induce matrix-valued quantum geometric tensors. While the minimal spin Bloch hyper-spheres exhibit similar properties in even and odd dimensions, their large spin counterparts differ qualitatively depending on the parity of the dimensions. Exact correspondences between spin-coherent states and monopole harmonics in higher dimensions are established. We also investigate density matrices described by Bloch hyper-balls and elucidate their corresponding statistical and geometric properties, such as von Neumann entropies and Bures quantum metrics.</description>

      <title>Electrical reversal of the sign for magnon thermal Hall coefficient in a van der Waals bilayer antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With spin-layer locking, the manipulation of spin degree of freedom via perpendicular electric field can be realized in a typical antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer. In analogy to the electric control of the anomalous layer Hall effect of electron within such bilayer system, we propose here its magnon counterpart i.e., thermal Hall effect controlled by a perpendicular electric field. Unlike electrons, magnon is charged neutral and its transport in solids can be driven by a thermal gradient. It also exhibits Hall response due to the intrinsic Berry curvature of magnon, analogous to the achievement in electron system. Taking bilayer 2H-VSe2 with both H-type stacking and interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling as a platform, we perform first-principles calculations towards the magnetic exchange coupling parameters under applied electric field perpendicular to the plane. Based on linear spin wave approximation, we then fit the magnon band structures accordingly and calculate the corresponding Berry curvature. The thermal Hall coefficient dependence on the temperature under thermal gradient can be calculated correspondingly in linear response regime. It is shown that electric field reversal is able to reverse the sign of the coefficient. These findings provide a platform for the realization of all-electric magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Depth-Resolved Characterization of Centrifugal Disk Finishing of Additively Manufactured Inconel 718</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface characteristics are a major contributor to the in-service performance, particularly fatigue life, of additively manufactured (AM) components. Centrifugal disk finishing (CDF) is one of many rigid media, abrasive machining processes employed to smooth the surfaces and edges of AM components. Within the general family of abrasive machining processes currently applied to AM, CDF is moderate in terms of material removal rate and the inertial forces exerted. How CDF alters the underlying microstructure of the processed surface is currently unknown. Here we employ white light profilometry and high-energy X-ray diffraction to characterize surface finish, crystallographic texture, and anisotropic distributions of residual microscale strain as a function of depth in CDF-finished Inconel 718 manufactured with laser powder bed fusion. Surfaces are finished using both unimodal and bimodal finishing media size distributions. We find that CDF will remove surface crystallographic textures (here a {111} fiber texture) from AM components, but generally not alter the bulk texture (here a cube texture). CDF is also found to impart significant amounts of residual microscale strain into the first 100 $\mu$m from the sample surface as evidenced by an approximately 50% increase in diffraction peak widths at 20 $\mu$m from the surface in comparison to 120 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density functional theory (DFT) databases as ground truth in training, and their prediction accuracy cannot surpass that of DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms DFT with the widely-used hybrid and double hybrid functionals in computational costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. As case studies, we apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>

      <title>Structural and Electrical Properties of Grafted Si/GaAsSb Heterojunction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength, especially 1.55 um, has attracted significant attention in various areas such as high-speed optical communication and LiDAR systems. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are a critical component as a receiver in these systems due to their internal gain which enhances the system performance. Silicon-based APDs are promising since they are CMOS compatible, but they are limited in detecting 1.55 um light detection. This study proposes a p-type Si on n-type GaAs0.51Sb0.49 (GaAsSb) lattice matched to InP substrates heterojunction formed using a grafting technique for future GaAsSb/Si APD technology. A p+Si nanomembrane is transferred onto the GaAsSb/AlInAs/InP substrate, with an ultrathin ALD-Al2O3 oxide at the interface, which behaves as both double-side passivation and quantum tunneling layers. The devices exhibit excellent surface morphology and interface quality, confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Also, the current-voltage (I-V) of the p+Si/n-GaAsSb heterojunction shows ideal rectifying characteristics with an ideality factor of 1.15. The I-V tests across multiple devices confirm high consistency and yield. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement reveals that GaAsSb and Si are found to have type-II band alignment with a conduction band offset of 50 meV which is favorable for the high-bandwidth APD application. The demonstration of the GaAsSb/Si heterojunction highlights the potential to advance current SWIR PD technologies.</description>

      <title>AC conductivity and magnetic dichroism of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magneto-optical properties of two-dimensional nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals in the presence of antiferromagnetic order. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor of two-dimensional CuMnAs, a prototype antiferromagnetic Dirac material, as a function of light frequency. From the finite-frequency conductivity tensor, we derive the dynamic dielectric function and magnetic linear dichroism, demonstrating how they are influenced by the orientation of the N{\'e}el order parameter. Adjusting the N{\'e}el vector changes both the sign and amplitude of the system's magneto-optical response. We propose that magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the orientation of the N{\'e}el vector.</description>

      <title>Thermal/epithermal neutron detection via LiO$_{2}$-doped fiber bundles: A computational study through GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the neutron capture processes in lithium or lithium-doped materials leads to the production of secondary alpha-triton pairs. The counts of these secondary charged particle pairs in the presence of thermal/epithermal neutrons indirectly give access to detecting the primary incident neutrons with the aid of the plastic scintillators by reminding that both these secondary alphas and tritons deposit their entire kinetic energy within a short range. In this study, we modify the polystyrene fiber core of Kuraray Y11-200(M) by doping with 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$. We investigate a fiber bundle system hinged on 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fibers via the GEANT4 simulations by targeting the detection of the incident thermal/epithermal neutrons through the generation of the secondary alpha-triton pairs. First, we estimate an optimal number of fiber arrays by using a monoenergetic beam of thermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 0.025 eV and we count the number of secondary alpha-triton pairs. Subsequently, we insert a pixelated photo-sensor on both ends of the fiber bundle in order to collect the entrapped optical photons. In addition to the thermal neutrons, we also explore the detection of epithermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 1 eV by utilizing a combination of the 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fiber bundles and the neutron absorption layers. We demonstrate that the LiO$_{2}$-doped plastic scintillating fiber bundles are instrumental for the detection of thermal/epithermal neutrons in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Impedance Spectroscopy for Electroceramics and Electrochemical System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This tutorial review focuses on the basic theoretical backgrounds, their working principles, and implementation of impedance spectroscopy in both electroceramics and electrochemical research and technological applications. Various contributions to the impedance, admittance, dielectric, and conductivity characteristics of electroceramic materials can be disentangled and independently characterized with the help of impedance spectroscopy as a function of frequency and temperature. In polycrystalline materials, the impedance, charge transport/ conduction mechanism, and the macroscopic dielectric properties i.e., dielectric constant and loss are typically composed of many contributions, including the bulk or grain resistance/capacitance, grain boundary, and sample-electrode interface effect. Similarly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) endeavors to the charging kinetics, diffusion, and mechanical impact of various electrochemical systems widely used in energy storage (i.e., supercapacitor, battery), corrosion resistance, chemical and bio-sensing, diagnostics, etc. in electrolytes as a function of frequency. The understanding of various contributions in the EIS spectra i.e., kinetic control, mass control, and diffusion control is essential for their practical implications. It is demonstrated that electrochemical and electroceramics impedance spectroscopy is an effective method to explain and simulate such behavior. Deconvolute these contributions to obtain a detailed understanding of the functionality of polycrystalline electroceramic materials. This short review aims to endow the expertise of senior researchers in many fields where both EIS (electrochemical and ceramics) are involved, as well as to provide the necessary background information for junior researchers working in these fields.</description>

      <title>Determining the Dielectric Constant of Solid/Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric constant ($\varepsilon^{\prime}$) of interfacial water is an important parameter, but its measurement has posed challenges, and no consensus has been reached on a generalized expression. We derived a formula for $\varepsilon^{\prime}$ of a buried interface using the slab model for a half-solvated sphere: $ \varepsilon^{\prime}=\varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2\left(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1+6\right) / 2\left(2 \varepsilon_2+\varepsilon_1\right)$, where $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the dielectric constants of the solid and liquid phases, respectively. We experimentally validated this expression using vibrational sum frequency generation and Fresnel factor calculations for interfaces of alumina with water ($ \mathrm{H_2O} $ and $ \mathrm{D_2O} $) and acetonitrile. This fills an important knowledge gap in the description of the dielectric constant of interfaces.</description>
