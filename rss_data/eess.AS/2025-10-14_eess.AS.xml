      <title>Perceptual Compensation of Ambisonics Recordings for Reproduction in Room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambisonics is a method for capturing and rendering a sound field accurately, assuming that the acoustics of the playback room does not significantly influence the sound field. However, in practice, the acoustics of the playback room may lead to a noticeable degradation in sound quality. We propose a recording and rendering method based on Ambisonics that utilizes a perceptually-motivated approach to compensate for the reverberation of the playback room. The recorded direct and reverberant sound field components in the spherical harmonics (SHs) domain are spectrally and spatially compensated to preserve the relevant auditory cues including the direction of arrival of the direct sound, the spectral energy of the direct and reverberant sound components, and the Interaural Coherence (IC) across each auditory band. In contrast to the conventional Ambisonics, a flexible number of Ambisonics channels can be used for audio rendering. Listening test results show that the proposed method provides a perceptually accurate rendering of the originally recorded sound field, outperforming both conventional Ambisonics without compensation and even ideal Ambisonics rendering in a simulated anechoic room. Additionally, subjective evaluations of listeners seated at the center of the loudspeaker array demonstrate that the method remains robust to head rotation and minor displacements.</description>

      <title>Phase Aware Ear-Conditioned Learning for Multi-Channel Binaural Speaker Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating competing speech in reverberant environments requires models that preserve spatial cues while maintaining separation efficiency. We present a Phase-aware Ear-conditioned speaker Separation network using eight microphones (PEASE-8) that consumes complex STFTs and directly introduces a raw-STFT input to the early decoder layer, bypassing the entire encoder pathway to improve reconstruction. The model is trained end-to-end with an SI-SDR-based objective against direct-path ear targets, jointly performing separation and dereverberation for two speakers in a fixed azimuth, eliminating the need for permutation invariant training. On spatialized two-speaker mixtures spanning anechoic, reverberant, and noisy conditions, PEASE-8 delivers strong separation and intelligibility. In reverberant environments, it achieves 12.37 dB SI-SDR, 0.87 STOI, and 1.86 PESQ at T60 = 0.6 s, while remaining competitive under anechoic conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Slimmable Speech Enhancement Network with Metric-Guided Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To further reduce the complexity of lightweight speech enhancement models, we introduce a gating-based Dynamically Slimmable Network (DSN). The DSN comprises static and dynamic components. For architecture-independent applicability, we introduce distinct dynamic structures targeting the commonly used components, namely, grouped recurrent neural network units, multi-head attention, convolutional, and fully connected layers. A policy module adaptively governs the use of dynamic parts at a frame-wise resolution according to the input signal quality, controlling computational load. We further propose Metric-Guided Training (MGT) to explicitly guide the policy module in assessing input speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the DSN achieves comparable enhancement performance in instrumental metrics to the state-of-the-art lightweight baseline, while using only 73% of its computational load on average. Evaluations of dynamic component usage ratios indicate that the MGT-DSN can appropriately allocate network resources according to the severity of input signal distortion.</description>

      <title>ILD-VIT: A Unified Vision Transformer Architecture for Detection of Interstitial Lung Disease from Respiratory Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) represents a group of restrictive chronic pulmonary diseases that impair oxygen acquisition by causing irreversible changes in the lungs such as fibrosis, scarring of parenchyma, etc. ILD conditions are often diagnosed by various clinical modalities such as spirometry, high-resolution lung imaging techniques, crackling respiratory sounds (RSs), etc. In this letter, we develop a novel vision transformer (VIT)-based deep learning framework namely, ILD-VIT, to detect the ILD condition using the RS recordings. The proposed framework comprises three major stages: pre-processing, mel spectrogram extraction, and classification using the proposed VIT architecture using the mel spectrogram image patches. Experimental results using the publicly available BRACETS and KAUH databases show that our proposed ILD-VIT achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 84.86%, 82.67%, and 86.91%, respectively, for subject-independent blind testing. The successful onboard implantation of the proposed framework on a Raspberry-pi-4 microcontroller indicates its potential as a standalone clinical system for ILD screening in a real clinical scenario.</description>

      <title>MTP-S2UT: Enhancing Speech-to-Speech Translation Quality with Multi-token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late. We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.</description>

      <title>Chord Colourizer: A Near Real-Time System for Visualizing Musical Key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Chord Colourizer, a near real-time system that detects the musical key of an audio signal and visually represents it through a novel graphical user interface (GUI). The system assigns colours to musical notes based on Isaac Newton's original colour wheel, preserving historical links between pitch and hue, and also integrates an Arduino-controlled LED display using 3D-printed star-shaped diffusers to offer a physical ambient media representation. The method employs Constant-Q Transform (CQT) chroma features for chord estimation and visualization, followed by threshold-based filtering and tonal enhancement to isolate the root, third, and fifth. A confidence score is computed for each detection to ensure reliability, and only chords with moderate to very strong certainty are visualized. The graphical interface dynamically updates a colour-coded keyboard layout, while the LED display provides the same colour information via spatial feedback. This multi-modal system enhances user interaction with harmonic content, offering innovative possibilities for education and artistic performance. Limitations include slight latency and the inability to detect extended chords, which future development will aim to address through refined filtering, adaptive thresholds, and support for more complex harmonies such as sevenths and augmented chords. Future work will also explore integration with alternative visualization styles, and the comparison of audio analysis libraries to improve detection speed and precision. Plans also include formal user testing to evaluate perception, usability, and cross-cultural interpretations of colour-pitch mappings.</description>

      <title>Peransformer: Improving Low-informed Expressive Performance Rendering with Score-aware Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly-informed Expressive Performance Rendering (EPR) systems transform music scores with rich musical annotations into human-like expressive performance MIDI files. While these systems have achieved promising results, the availability of detailed music scores is limited compared to MIDI files and are less flexible to work with using a digital audio workstation (DAW). Recent advancements in low-informed EPR systems offer a more accessible alternative by directly utilizing score-derived MIDI as input, but these systems often exhibit suboptimal performance. Meanwhile, existing works are evaluated with diverse automatic metrics and data formats, hindering direct objective comparisons between EPR systems. In this study, we introduce Peransformer, a transformer-based low-informed EPR system designed to bridge the gap between low-informed and highly-informed EPR systems. Our approach incorporates a score-aware discriminator that leverages the underlying score-derived MIDI files and is trained on a score-to-performance paired, note-to-note aligned MIDI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that Peransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance among low-informed systems, as validated by subjective evaluations. Furthermore, we extend existing automatic evaluation metrics for EPR systems and introduce generalized EPR metrics (GEM), enabling more direct, accurate, and reliable comparisons across EPR systems.</description>

      <title>ProGress: Structured Music Generation via Graph Diffusion and Hierarchical Music Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music generation is undergoing rapid developments, with recent symbolic models leveraging sophisticated deep learning and diffusion model algorithms. One drawback with existing models is that they lack structural cohesion, particularly on harmonic-melodic structure. Furthermore, such existing models are largely "black-box" in nature and are not musically interpretable. This paper addresses these limitations via a novel generative music framework that incorporates concepts of Schenkerian analysis (SchA) in concert with a diffusion modeling framework. This framework, which we call ProGress (Prolongation-enhanced DiGress), adapts state-of-the-art deep models for discrete diffusion (in particular, the DiGress model of Vignac et al., 2023) for interpretable and structured music generation. Concretely, our contributions include 1) novel adaptations of the DiGress model for music generation, 2) a novel SchA-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and 3) a framework allowing users to control various aspects of the generation process to create coherent musical compositions. Results from human experiments suggest superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Bhasha-Rupantarika: Algorithm-Hardware Co-design approach for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bhasha-Rupantarika, a light and efficient multilingual translation system tailored through algorithm-hardware codesign for resource-limited settings. The method investigates model deployment at sub-octet precision levels (FP8, INT8, INT4, and FP4), with experimental results indicating a 4.1x reduction in model size (FP4) and a 4.2x speedup in inference speed, which correlates with an increased throughput of 66 tokens/s (improvement by 4.8x). This underscores the importance of ultra-low precision quantization for real-time deployment in IoT devices using FPGA accelerators, achieving performance on par with expectations. Our evaluation covers bidirectional translation between Indian and international languages, showcasing its adaptability in low-resource linguistic contexts. The FPGA deployment demonstrated a 1.96x reduction in LUTs and a 1.65x decrease in FFs, resulting in a 2.2x enhancement in throughput compared to OPU and a 4.6x enhancement compared to HPTA. Overall, the evaluation provides a viable solution based on quantisation-aware translation along with hardware efficiency suitable for deployable multilingual AI systems. The entire codes [https://github.com/mukullokhande99/Bhasha-Rupantarika/] and dataset for reproducibility are publicly available, facilitating rapid integration and further development by researchers.</description>

      <title>Delayed 1T to 2H Phase Transition Upon Electrochemical Delithiation of LiMoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a widely studied layered material for electronic, optical, and catalytic applications. It can host lithium ions between the van der Waals layers, which triggers a phase transition between the semiconducting 2H phase and metallic 1T phase. While lithium insertion triggers a phase transition to the 1T phase, the phase behavior upon electrochemical lithium removal is not resolved. In this work, we conduct single-flake electrochemical (de)lithiation of MoS2 using microelectrode arrays. Through both electrochemical voltage analysis and correlative Raman spectroscopy, we show that an electrochemically cycled and delithiated MoS2 flake initially remains in the 1T phase. However, over the course of several days, it transitions back into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase. This result resolves the phase transformation pathway upon delithiation and showcases the ability to electrochemically synthesize the metastable 1T-MoS2 phase.</description>

      <title>Unify Variables in Neural Scaling Laws for General Audio Representations via Embedding Effective Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws have profoundly shaped our understanding of model performance in computer vision and natural language processing, yet their application to general audio representation learning remains underexplored. A key challenge lies in the multifactorial nature of general audio representation-representation quality is jointly influenced by variables such as audio length, embedding dimensionality, model depth, model architecture, data volume, etc., many of which are difficult to isolate or express analytically. In this work, we present a systematic study of scaling laws for general audio representations by utilizing embedding effective rank (RankMe) as a unifying metric that encapsulates the impact of diverse variables on representation quality. RankMe enables a label-free, information-theoretic quantification of audio embeddings, allowing us to examine scaling behaviors across a wide hyper-parameter space, including model size, training data volume, computational budget, architectural configurations, etc. Our empirical findings reveal a consistent power-law relationship between RankMe and representation quality, suggesting that embedding effective rank serves as a reliable proxy for assessing and predicting model performance in audio representation learning. This work not only validates the applicability of classical scaling principles to the general audio domain but also offers a theoretically grounded and empirically robust framework for guiding future model scaling strategies in audio foundation models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Edge Test-Time Adaptation via Latent Feature Coordinate Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while $\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore, we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge devices in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Link: Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Bridging the Audio-Text Modality Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations, yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

      <title>Automatic Music Sample Identification with Multi-Track Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification, that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes, and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this task.</description>

      <title>Speech Enhancement and Dereverberation with Diffusion-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we build upon our previous publication and use diffusion-based generative models for speech enhancement. We present a detailed overview of the diffusion process that is based on a stochastic differential equation and delve into an extensive theoretical examination of its implications. Opposed to usual conditional generation tasks, we do not start the reverse process from pure Gaussian noise but from a mixture of noisy speech and Gaussian noise. This matches our forward process which moves from clean speech to noisy speech by including a drift term. We show that this procedure enables using only 30 diffusion steps to generate high-quality clean speech estimates. By adapting the network architecture, we are able to significantly improve the speech enhancement performance, indicating that the network, rather than the formalism, was the main limitation of our original approach. In an extensive cross-dataset evaluation, we show that the improved method can compete with recent discriminative models and achieves better generalization when evaluating on a different corpus than used for training. We complement the results with an instrumental evaluation using real-world noisy recordings and a listening experiment, in which our proposed method is rated best. Examining different sampler configurations for solving the reverse process allows us to balance the performance and computational speed of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that the proposed method is also suitable for dereverberation and thus not limited to additive background noise removal. Code and audio examples are available online, see https://github.com/sp-uhh/sgmse.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Noise Robustness for Neural Speech Codecs through Resource-Efficient Progressive Quantization Perturbation Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise robustness remains a critical challenge for deploying neural speech codecs in real-world acoustic scenarios where background noise is often inevitable. A key observation we make is that even slight input noise perturbations can cause unintended shifts in quantized codewords, thereby degrading the quality of reconstructed speech. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel and resource-efficient training strategy to enhance the noise robustness of speech codecs by simulating such perturbations directly at the quantization level. Our approach introduces two core mechanisms: (1) a distance-weighted probabilistic top-K sampling strategy that replaces the conventional deterministic nearest-neighbor selection in residual vector quantization (RVQ); and (2) a progressive training scheme that introduces perturbations from the last to the first quantizer in a controlled manner. Crucially, our method is trained exclusively on clean speech, eliminating the need for any paired noisy-clean data. Experiments on two advanced neural speech codecs, Encodec and WavTokenizer, demonstrate that the proposed strategy substantially improves robustness under noisy conditions-for example, boosting UTMOS from 3.475 to 3.586 at 15 dB SNR on Encodec-while also enhancing coding quality for clean speech.</description>

      <title>SongFormer: Scaling Music Structure Analysis with Heterogeneous Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music structure analysis (MSA) underpins music understanding and controllable generation, yet progress has been limited by small, inconsistent corpora. We present SongFormer, a scalable framework that learns from heterogeneous supervision. SongFormer (i) fuses short- and long-window self-supervised audio representations to capture both fine-grained and long-range dependencies, and (ii) introduces a learned source embedding to enable training with partial, noisy, and schema-mismatched labels. To support scaling and fair evaluation, we release SongFormDB, the largest MSA corpus to date (over 10k tracks spanning languages and genres), and SongFormBench, a 300-song expert-verified benchmark. On SongFormBench, SongFormer sets a new state of the art in strict boundary detection (HR.5F) and achieves the highest functional label accuracy, while remaining computationally efficient; it surpasses strong baselines and Gemini 2.5 Pro on these metrics and remains competitive under relaxed tolerance (HR3F). Code, datasets, and model are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Speaker Verification with w2v-BERT 2.0 and Knowledge Distillation guided Structured Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale self-supervised Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) have shown significant improvements in the speaker verification (SV) task by providing rich feature representations. In this paper, we utilize w2v-BERT 2.0, a model with approximately 600 million parameters trained on 4.5 million hours of unlabeled data across 143 languages, for the SV task. The MFA structure with Layer Adapter is employed to process the multi-layer feature outputs from the PTM and extract speaker embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA for efficient fine-tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results with 0.12% and 0.55% EER on the Vox1-O and Vox1-H test sets, respectively. Furthermore, we apply knowledge distillation guided structured pruning, reducing the model size by 80% while achieving only a 0.04% EER degradation.

      <title>Modeling nonuniform energy decay through the modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer (MoD-ART)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling late reverberation in real-time interactive applications is a challenging task when multiple sound sources and listeners are present in the same environment. This is especially problematic when the environment is geometrically complex and/or features uneven energy absorption (e.g. coupled volumes), because in such cases the late reverberation is dependent on the sound sources' and listeners' positions, and therefore must be adapted to their movements in real time. We present a novel approach to the task, named modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer (MoD-ART), which can handle highly complex scenarios with efficiency. The approach is based on the geometrical acoustics method of acoustic radiance transfer, from which we extract a set of energy decay modes and their positional relationships with sources and listeners. In this paper, we describe the physical and mathematical significance of MoD-ART, highlighting its advantages and applicability to different scenarios. Through an analysis of the method's computational complexity, we show that it compares very favorably with ray-tracing. We also present simulation results showing that MoD-ART can capture multiple decay slopes and flutter echoes.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Environment Adaptation of Data-Driven Underwater Acoustic Source Ranging Based on Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting pre-trained deep learning models to new and unknown environments remains a major challenge in underwater acoustic localization. We show that although the performance of pre-trained models suffers from mismatch between the training and test data, they generally exhibit a higher uncertainty in environments where there is more mismatch. Additionally, in the presence of environmental mismatch, spurious peaks can appear in the output of classification-based localization approaches, which inspires us to define and use a method to quantify the "implied uncertainty" based on the number of model output peaks. Leveraging this notion of implied uncertainty, we partition the test samples into sets with more certain and less certain samples, and implement a method to adapt the model to new environments by using the certain samples to improve the labeling for uncertain samples, which helps to adapt the model. Thus, using this efficient method for model uncertainty quantification, we showcase an innovative approach to adapt a pre-trained model to unseen underwater environments at test time. This eliminates the need for labeled data from the target environment or the original training data. This adaptation is enhanced by integrating an independent estimate based on the received signal energy. We validate the approach extensively using real experimental data, as well as synthetic data consisting of model-generated signals with real ocean noise. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model prediction accuracy, underscoring the potential of the method to enhance underwater acoustic localization in diverse, noisy, and unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Data Standards in Audiology: A Mixed-Methods Exploration of Community Perspectives and Implementation Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study addresses conceptual issues around data standardisation in audiology, and outlines steps toward achieving it. It reports a survey of the computational audiology community on their current understanding, needs, and preferences concerning data standards. Based on survey findings and a panel discussion, recommendations are made concerning moving forward with standardisation in audiology.
  Design: Mixed-methods: 1) review of existing standardisation efforts; 2) a survey of the computational audiology community; 3) expert panel discussion in a dedicated session at the 2024 Virtual Conference of Computational Audiology. Sample: Survey: 82 members of the global community; Panel discussion: five experts.
  Results: A prerequisite for any global audiology database are agreed data standards. Although many are familiar with the general idea, few know of existing initiatives, or have actively participated in them. Ninety percent of respondents expressed willingness to follow or contribute to standardisation efforts. The panel discussed relevant initiatives (e.g. OMOP, openEHR, NOAH) and explored both challenges (around harmonisation) and opportunities (alignment with other medical fields and conversion among approaches).
  Conclusions: Combining conceptual discussion with stakeholder views, the study offers guidance for implementing interoperable data standards in audiology. It highlights community support, key issues to address, and suggests paths for future work.</description>

      <title>MGE-LDM: Joint Latent Diffusion for Simultaneous Music Generation and Source Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories. Audio samples are available at our project page: https://yoongi43.github.io/MGELDM_Samples/.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$: Benchmarking the Robustness of Audio-Visual Recognition Models at Test-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance, their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities, making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur $\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models. $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets, $\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and $\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available $\href{https://github.com/sarthaxxxxx/AV-C-Robustness-Benchmark}{here}$.</description>

      <title>GRAM: Spatial general-purpose audio representation models for real-world applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although audio foundations models have seen great progress on a wide variety of tasks, their application in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise has been less successful. Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.</description>

      <title>Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods.

      <title>PicoAudio2: Temporal Controllable Text-to-Audio Generation with Natural Language Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent work in controllable text-to-audio (TTA) generation has achieved fine-grained control through timestamp conditioning, its scope remains limited by audio quality and input format. These models often suffer from poor audio quality in real datasets due to sole reliance on synthetic data. Moreover, some models are constrained to a closed vocabulary of sound events, preventing them from controlling audio generation for open-ended, free-text queries. This paper introduces PicoAudio2, a framework that advances temporal-controllable TTA by mitigating these data and architectural limitations. Specifically, we use a grounding model to annotate event timestamps of real audio-text datasets to curate temporally-strong real data, in addition to simulation data from existing works. The model is trained on the combination of real and simulation data. Moreover, we propose an enhanced architecture that integrates the fine-grained information from a timestamp matrix with coarse-grained free-text input. Experiments show that PicoAudio2 exhibits superior performance in terms of temporal controllability and audio quality.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Diffusion-Like Models for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.</description>

      <title>WavJEPA: Semantic learning unlocks robust audio foundation models for raw waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning audio representations from raw waveforms overcomes key limitations of spectrogram-based audio representation learning, such as the long latency of spectrogram computation and the loss of phase information. Yet, while self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources. Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world applications.</description>
