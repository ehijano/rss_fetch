      <title>Room temperature detection of the (H2)2 dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen dimer, (H2)2, is among the most weakly bound van der Waals complexes and a prototype species for first principles ab initio studies. The detection of the (H2)2 infrared absorption spectrum was reported more than thirty years ago at a temperature of 20 K. Due to the sharp decrease of the (H2)2 abundance with temperature, a detection at room temperature was generally considered as hardly achievable. Here we report the first room temperature detection of partly resolved rotational structures of (H2)2 by cavity ring down spectroscopy at sub-atmospheric pressures, in the region of the first overtone band of H2 near 1.2 micron. The quantitative analysis of the absorption features observed around ten allowed or forbidden transition frequencies of the monomer provides insight on the structure of this elusive species and a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Formulation of Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Ehrenfest Dynamics with Real-time TDDFT for Extended Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian-based implementation of Ehrenfest dynamics with nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) theory and real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) for extended periodic systems. In addition to a quantum dynamical treatment of electrons and selected protons, this approach allows for the classical movement of all other nuclei to be taken into account in simulations of condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrangian formulation for the traveling proton basis approach and propose new schemes to enhance its application for extended periodic systems. Validation and proof-of-principle applications are performed on electronically excited proton transfer in the o-hydroxybenzaldehyde molecule with explicit solvating water molecules. These simulations demonstrate the importance of solvation dynamics and a quantum treatment of transferring protons. This work broadens the applicability of the NEO Ehrenfest dynamics approach for studying complex heterogeneous systems in the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics-Consistent Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose excess Gibbs free energy graph neural networks (GE-GNNs) for predicting composition-dependent activity coefficients of binary mixtures. The GE-GNN architecture ensures thermodynamic consistency by predicting the molar excess Gibbs free energy and using thermodynamic relations to obtain activity coefficients. As these are differential, automatic differentiation is applied to learn the activity coefficients in an end-to-end manner. Since the architecture is based on fundamental thermodynamics, we do not require additional loss terms to learn thermodynamic consistency. As the output is a fundamental property, we neither impose thermodynamic modeling limitations and assumptions. We demonstrate high accuracy and thermodynamic consistency of the activity coefficient predictions.</description>

      <title>Preserving Surface Strain in Nanocatalysts via Morphology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering strain critically affects the properties of materials and has extensive applications in semiconductors and quantum systems. However, the deployment of strain-engineered nanocatalysts faces challenges, particularly in maintaining highly strained nanocrystals under reaction conditions. Here, we introduce a morphology-dependent effect that stabilizes surface strain even under harsh reaction conditions. Employing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), we discovered that core-shell Au@Pd nanoparticles with sharp-edged morphologies sustain coherent heteroepitaxial interfaces with designated surface strain. This configuration inhibits dislocation due to reduced shear stress at corners, as molecular dynamics simulations indicate. Demonstrated in a Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction, our approach achieves a fourfold increase in activity over conventional nanocatalysts, owing to the enhanced stability of surface strain. These findings contribute to advancing the development of advanced nanocatalysts and indicate broader applications for strain engineering in various fields.</description>

      <title>Comparison of integral equation theories of the liquid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ornstein-Zernike equation is a powerful tool in liquid state theory for predicting structural and thermodynamic properties of fluids. Combined with a suitable closure, it has been shown to reproduce e.g. the static structure factor, pressure, and compressibility of liquids to a great degree of accuracy. However, out of the multitude of closures that exist for the Ornstein-Zernike equation, it is hard to predict a priori which closure will give the most accurate predictions for the system at hand. To alleviate this problem, we compare the predictive power of many closures on a curated set of representative benchmark systems, including those with hard-sphere, inverse power-law, Gaussian core, and Lennard-Jones particles, in three and two dimensions. For example, we find that the well-known and highly used Percus-Yevick closure gives significantly worse predictions than lesser-known closures of equal complexity in all cases studied. We anticipate that the trends observed in our results will aid in making more informed decisions regarding closure choices. To facilitate the adoption of more modern closure theories, we also have packaged, documented, and distributed the code necessary to numerically solve the equations for a given closure and pair interaction potential.</description>

      <title>Probing molecular photophysics in a matter-wave interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that matter-wave diffraction off a single standing laser wave can be used as an accurate measurement scheme for photophysical molecular parameters. These include state-dependent optical polarizabilities and photon-absorption cross sections, the relaxation rates for fluorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, as well as ionization or cleavage probabilities. We discuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the interference pattern, and determine the accuracy of molecular parameters estimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The analysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which accounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite longitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the gravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Peak Assignment in 13C NMR Spectroscopy: A Novel Approach Using Multimodal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays an essential role in deciphering molecular structure and dynamic behaviors. While AI-enhanced NMR prediction models hold promise, challenges still persist in tasks such as molecular retrieval, isomer recognition, and peak assignment. In response, this paper introduces a novel solution, Multi-Level Multimodal Alignment with Knowledge-Guided Instance-Wise Discrimination (K-M3AID), which establishes correspondences between two heterogeneous modalities: molecular graphs and NMR spectra. K-M3AID employs a dual-coordinated contrastive learning architecture with three key modules: a graph-level alignment module, a node-level alignment module, and a communication channel. Notably, K-M3AID introduces knowledge-guided instance-wise discrimination into contrastive learning within the node-level alignment module. In addition, K-M3AID demonstrates that skills acquired during node-level alignment have a positive impact on graph-level alignment, acknowledging meta-learning as an inherent property. Empirical validation underscores K-M3AID's effectiveness in multiple zero-shot tasks.</description>

      <title>A Review of Large Language Models and Autonomous Agents in Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry, significantly impacting molecule design, property prediction, and synthesis optimization. This review highlights LLM capabilities in these domains and their potential to accelerate scientific discovery through automation. We also review LLM-based autonomous agents: LLMs with a broader set of tools to interact with their surrounding environment. These agents perform diverse tasks such as paper scraping, interfacing with automated laboratories, and synthesis planning. As agents are an emerging topic, we extend the scope of our review of agents beyond chemistry and discuss across any scientific domains. This review covers the recent history, current capabilities, and design of LLMs and autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration, model interpretability, and the need for standard benchmarks, while future directions point towards more sophisticated multi-modal agents and enhanced collaboration between agents and experimental methods. Due to the quick pace of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science.</description>
