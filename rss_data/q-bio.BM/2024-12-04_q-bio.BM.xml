      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales [Di Bari et al., PNAS 121, e2406807121 (2024)]. In analogy with other disordered systems, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven epistatic landscape. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions inspired by statistical physics, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the ancestral protein sequence from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.</description>

      <title>Importance Weighted Expectation-Maximization for Protein Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing protein sequences with desired biological function is crucial in biology and chemistry. Recent machine learning methods use a surrogate sequence-function model to replace the expensive wet-lab validation. How can we efficiently generate diverse and novel protein sequences with high fitness? In this paper, we propose IsEM-Pro, an approach to generate protein sequences towards a given fitness criterion. At its core, IsEM-Pro is a latent generative model, augmented by combinatorial structure features from a separately learned Markov random fields (MRFs). We develop an Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization method (MCEM) to learn the model. During inference, sampling from its latent space enhances diversity while its MRFs features guide the exploration in high fitness regions. Experiments on eight protein sequence design tasks show that our IsEM-Pro outperforms the previous best methods by at least 55% on average fitness score and generates more diverse and novel protein sequences.</description>

      <title>BInD: Bond and Interaction-generating Diffusion Model for Multi-objective Structure-based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A remarkable advance in geometric deep generative models with accumulated structural data enables structure-based drug design (SBDD) with target protein information only. However, most existing models struggle to address multi-objectives simultaneously while performing well only in their specialized tasks. Here, we present BInD, a diffusion model with knowledge-based guidance for multi-objective SBDD. BInD is designed to co-generate molecules and their interactions with a target protein to consider all key objectives equally well, including target-specific interactions, molecular properties, and local geometry. Comprehensive evaluations show that BInD achieves robust performance for all objectives while outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods for each. Finally, we propose a train-free optimization method empowered by retrieving target-specific interactions, highlighting the role of non-covalent interactions in achieving higher selectivity and binding affinities to a target protein.</description>

      <title>mdCATH: A Large-Scale MD Dataset for Data-Driven Computational Biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in protein structure determination are revolutionizing our understanding of proteins. Still, a significant gap remains in the availability of comprehensive datasets that focus on the dynamics of proteins, which are crucial for understanding protein function, folding, and interactions. To address this critical gap, we introduce mdCATH, a dataset generated through an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a diverse and representative collection of protein domains. This dataset comprises all-atom systems for 5,398 domains, modeled with a state-of-the-art classical force field, and simulated in five replicates each at five temperatures from 320 K to 450 K. The mdCATH dataset records coordinates and forces every 1 ns, for over 62 ms of accumulated simulation time, effectively capturing the dynamics of the various classes of domains and providing a unique resource for proteome-wide statistical analyses of protein unfolding thermodynamics and kinetics. We outline the dataset structure and showcase its potential through four easily reproducible case studies, highlighting its capabilities in advancing protein science.</description>
