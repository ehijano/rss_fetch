      <title>A game played by tandem-running ants: Hint of procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\textit{Diacamma}$ $\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.</description>

      <title>Cycling and tensed cells interpenetrated by non-cycling and compressed cells form a critical epithelial reticulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto Mean Field Game with Intrinsic Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a mean field game formulation of the classical Kuramoto model for synchronization. Our model captures the diversity within the population by considering random intrinsic frequencies, which allows us to study the impact of this heterogeneity on synchronization patterns and stability. Our findings contribute insights into the interplay between intrinsic frequency diversity and synchronization dynamics, offering a more realistic understanding of complex systems. The proposed framework has broad applications ranging from coupled oscillators in physics to social dynamics, and serves as a valuable tool for studying networks with distributed intrinsic frequencies.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>
