      <title>Fusion in a nanoshell: Harnessing plasmonic fields for nuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface of metal nanoparticles can support plasmonic excitations. These excitations dramatically amplify the electric field of incident light (by several orders of magnitude), potentially ionizing the irradiated nanoparticles in a strong field regime. Under specific conditions, a resonant enhancement of the electric field \textit{inside} a hollow nanoshell can be achieved with a laser pulse. We propose high-intensity laser irradiation of heavy water (${\rm D_2 O}$)-filled metal nanoshells to induce nuclear fusion via this enhancement. In this ``plasmonic confinement'' setup, deuteron nuclei are accelerated by the oscillating electric field within the nanoshell. We estimate that the characteristic momenta of the colliding deuterons reach approximately 10 MeV. This corresponds to an effective kinetic energy equivalent to that of deuterons in a thermonuclear plasma at temperatures around 25 keV (approximately $10^8$K). A laser with a peak pulse intensity of roughly 1 atomic unit is sufficient to generate the strong electric fields required for this plasmonic acceleration. We estimate the expected fusion rate and discuss the feasibility of a fusion reactor based on this proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Thermal Shrinkage-Induced Modifications in Photonic Band Gaps of Two-Photon Polymerized Bragg Reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) polymer-based photonic crystals (PhCs) in the $1.55~\mu{}m$ wavelength range can be easily created using a two-photon direct laser writing system. To achieve shorter period structures, we report the use of thermal shrinkage of two-photon polymerized structures, at elevated temperatures, to eliminate unpolymerised material, leading to the uniform shrinkage of the distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) structures by a ratio of $\sim$ 2.5 to 5. Our Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation and the angle-resolved light scattering characterization technique using Fourier image spectroscopy (FIS) measurements show that the low order photonic bandgaps of DBRs blue-shift across the NIR-visible region (850 to 400 nm) as the shrinkage increases.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photonic Emulator of Potential-free Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum emulator utilizes photons to emulate the quantum physical behavior of a complex quantum system. Recent study in spatiotemporal optics has enriched the toolbox for designing and manipulating complex spatiotemporal optical wavepackets, bringing new opportunities in building such quantum emulators. In this work, we demonstrate a new type of photonic quantum emulator enabled by spatiotemporal localized wavepackets with spherical harmonic symmetry. The spatiotemporal field distribution of these wavepackets has the same distributions of the wavefunction solutions to the potential-free Schr\"odinger equation with two controllable quantum numbers. A series of such localized wavepackets are experimentally generated with their localized feature verified. These localized wavepackets can propagate invariantly in space-time like particles, forming a new type of photonic quantum emulator that may provide new insight in studying quantum physics and open up new applications in studying light-matter interactions and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Nano-3D: Metasurface-Based Neural Depth Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth imaging is a foundational building block for broad applications, such as autonomous driving and virtual/augmented reality. Traditionally, depth cameras have relied on time-of-flight sensors or multi-lens systems to achieve physical depth measurements. However, these systems often face a trade-off between a bulky form factor and imprecise approximations, limiting their suitability for spatially constrained scenarios. Inspired by the emerging advancements of nano-optics, we present Nano-3D, a metasurface-based neural depth imaging solution with an ultra-compact footprint. Nano-3D integrates our custom-fabricated 700 nm thick TiO2 metasurface with a multi-module deep neural network to extract precise metric depth information from monocular metasurface-polarized imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Nano-3D with both simulated and physical experiments. We hope the exhibited success paves the way for the community to bridge future graphics systems with emerging nanomaterial technologies through novel computational approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast Calculation of Nonuniform Plane Waves at Arbitrarily Oriented and Charged Planar Interfaces of Isotropic Lossy Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast method for calculating the reflected and transmitted waves for a given nonuniform plane wave incident on an arbitrarily oriented and charged planar interface between two isotropic and possibly lossy media is proposed based on the decomposition of the complex wave vector and complex wave numbers with respect to the unit normal vector of the interface. According to the complex vector analysis, the exact definition of the complex angles of incidence, reflection and refraction are presented and applied in the complex forms of Snell's law and Fresnel equations to quickly and correctly calculate the complex wave vectors and the complex electric fields of the reflected and refracted waves at a charged interface where the surface charge and current densities are considered. The calculation procedure and two practical examples are also given to demonstrate the validity and powerfulness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Multispectral radiation temperature inversion based on Transformer-LSTM-SVM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key challenge in multispectral radiation thermometry is accurately measuring emissivity. Traditional constrained optimization methods often fail to meet practical requirements in terms of precision, efficiency, and noise resistance. However, the continuous advancement of neural networks in data processing offers a potential solution to this issue. This paper presents a multispectral radiation thermometry algorithm that combines Transformer, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to mitigate the impact of emissivity, thereby enhancing accuracy and noise resistance. In simulations, compared to the BP neural network algorithm, GIM-LSTM, and Transformer-LSTM algorithms, the Transformer-LSTM-SVM algorithm demonstrates an improvement in accuracy of 1.23%, 0.46% and 0.13%, respectively, without noise. When 5% random noise is added, the accuracy increases by 1.39%, 0.51%, and 0.38%, respectively. Finally, experiments confirmed that the maximum temperature error using this method is less than 1%, indicating that the algorithm offers high accuracy, fast processing speed, and robust noise resistance. These characteristics make it well-suited for real-time high-temperature measurements with multi-wavelength thermometry equipment.</description>

      <title>Beam Spliter and Localization Induced by Controlled Perturbations after Time Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent investigation into the phenomena of refraction and reflection at temporal boundaries, conducted through the lens of spacetime duality, has attracted considerable scholarly interest. This duality unveils insights into the propagation behaviors of beams at the temporal boundaries of perturbed systems. We have delineated a temporal boundary effect amenable to external control through a specifically tailored driving force, augmented by a time-varying constituent within the driving signal. We then unveil the phenomenon of beam splitting-both in time refraction and reflection induced by perturbing the lattice's hopping parameter over time. By introducing varying intensities of aperiodic disorder to the coupling coefficients, we have exercised authority over the reflection angles. Our results lay the groundwork for delving into the temporal evolution of crystalline attributes via temporal boundary effects, while also enabling deliberate manipulation of spatial distribution frequency patterns by regulating the form and magnitude of noise. The results offer a manageable avenue for scrutinizing condensed-matter phenomena through providing an experimentally feasible solution.</description>

      <title>Topology-Driven Design of Bianisotropic Metasurfaces Through Knot-Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bianisotropic metasurfaces enable advanced electromagnetic wave manipulation through magnetoelectric coupling. Here, we demonstrate how knot-particles enable single-layer bianisotropic control using their inherent topology. Leveraging their geometric properties, we examine 3D wire configurations characterized by the knot winding numbers (p,q), generating balanced electric and magnetic response. Through multipole analysis we demonstrate efficient polarization rotation with high transmission for different knot-particle topologies. We explore the knot-particle topologies required to achieve perfectly matched polarization rotation and derive simple design rules for the knot parameters without resorting to numerical optimization. The microscopic polarizability tensors and macroscopic susceptibilities reveal the trefoil knot exhibits strong chiral bianisotropic behavior through its magnetoelectric coupling tensor. We implement knot-particle metasurfaces using advanced 3D printing which realizes the full 3D geometry of the wires. We present simplified flat designs suitable for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) fabrication that preserve the essential symmetry that enables the bianisotropic properties.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous active and diffusive behaviour of asymmetric microclusters in a photophoretic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active and diffusive motion in Brownian particles are regularly observed in fluidic environments, albeit at different time scales. Here, we experimentally study the dynamics of highly asymmetric microclusters trapped in air employing photophoretic forces generated from a loosely focused laser beam, where the trapped particles display active and diffusive dynamics simultaneously in orthogonal spatial directions. Thus, particle motion in the longitudinal direction ($z$) is enslaved to irregular kicks that naturally arise from an interplay of gravitational and photophoretic forces. This leads to a bimodal nature of the probability distribution function with a near-ballistic scaling of mean-squared displacement in the $z$ direction demonstrating active like dynamics, while the dynamics along the transverse ($x$) direction displays diffusive behaviour with a strong dependence on the motion along $z$. To explain these unique characteristics, we developed a 2D-Langevin model of a confined elliptic particle experiencing an additional stochastic force along $z$ to account for the arbitrary jumps. The numerical results show excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Our findings should pave the way for the design of high-efficiency Brownian engines in air, besides stimulating new research in the emerging field of photophoretic trapping.</description>

      <title>Event Soliton Formation in Mixed Energy-Momentum Gaps of Nonlinear Spacetime Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the formation of a novel soliton, termed event soliton, in nonlinear photonic spacetime crystals (STCs). In these media, simultaneous spatiotemporal periodic modulation of the dielectric constant generates mixed frequency (${\omega}$) and wavevector (k) gaps. Under Kerr nonlinearity, the event solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and energy-momentum domains, providing a tangible demonstration of the concept of event in relativity. The ${\omega}$k-gap mixture arises from the coexistence and competition between time reflected and Bragg reflected waves due to the spatiotemporal modulation. We propose a new partial differential equation to capture various spatiotemporal patterns and present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions, reflecting a three-way balance among k-gap opening, ${\omega}$-gap opening, and nonlinearity. Our work opens avenues for fundamental studies and fosters experimental prospects for implementing spacetime crystals in both time-varying photonics and periodically driven condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature-Resilient Hyperbolicity in a Mixed-Dimensional Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic superlattices are used for sub-wavelength focusing, cloaking, and optical thermal management. Typically, these superlattices are constructed of layers of noble metals and insulators. Despite these systems displaying excellent optical performance, the poor thermal stability of noble metals prevents their application in high-temperature environments. Instead, CMOS-compatible transition-metal nitrides are often substituted for noble metals in plasmonic systems since they have high thermal stability at the expense of optical properties. Here, we fabricate hyperbolic titanium nitride (TiN)/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) superlattices with 3D-2D interfaces. The mixed-dimensional nature of the interfaces prevents atoms from diffusing across the interface at high temperatures. The hyperbolicity of the superlattice is found to be unaffected by annealing at high temperature (800 oC for 10 hrs), and TiN/hBN is found to have a larger hyperbolic figure of merit than similar superlattices.</description>

      <title>A GHz fiber comb on silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 1 GHz Yb-fiber laser frequency comb built on silica substrates, utilizing "optical cubes" to house all optical components, ensuring long-term stability and practical operation. Both the femtosecond laser and f-to-2f interferometer are constructed to silica bricks, with a compact footprint of 290 mm $\times$ 250 mm, and a total weight of 1.8 kg. This system provides a stable repetition rate, offset frequency, and a supercontinuum spanning 460-1560 nm without requiring amplification. The carrier-envelop offset frequency exhibits exceptional stability, with a fractional frequency instability of $3.07\times 10^{-18}$ at a 1 second averaging time, improving to $2.12\times 10^{-20}$ at a 10,000 second, maintaining uninterrupted operation for over 60 hours. This work demonstrates a high-performance GHz fiber-based frequency comb, paving the way for applications beyond laboratory environments, including dual-comb spectroscopy, astronomical spectrograph calibration, and portable optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Bend-Resolved Modal Basis in Deformed Multimode Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-mixing in fiber from mechanical bending leads to optical perturbations that distort the spatial field profile of coherent beams as they propagate through few or multiple-mode fiber. The observed output from a bent fiber commonly induces complex speckle, which is challenging to directly relate to the bend condition in the fiber, especially for continuously moving systems, such as aerial-deployed fiber or fiber sensors in machinery. We introduce a novel method for constructing a complete mechanically defined modal basis that embodies all fiber deformations resulting from the controlled bending of a multi-mode fiber. This specific basis arises from a differential exchange of power between spatially asymmetric, deformation-dependent orthogonal sets, obtained through singular value decomposition of correlation matrices derived exclusively from speckle patterns at the fiber's distal end under specific deformation conditions. These spatially quasi-symmetric basis closely resembles a superposition of the fiber's propagation-invariant modes, with aberrations that result from mechanical deformations. This approach could be readily integrated into mode-division-multiplexing systems to monitor changes in the mechanical variation along deployed fibers for network resilience and fault prediction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Metasurface-Backed Luneburg Lens for Multiplexed Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communications is attractive for its low power requirements due to the lack of actively radiating components; however, commonly used devices are typically limited in range and functionality. Here, we design and demonstrate a flattened Luneburg lens combined with a spatially-tunable dynamic metasurface to create a low-power backscatter communicator. The Luneburg lens is a spherically-symmetric lens that focuses a collimated beam from any direction, enabling a wide field-of-view with no aberrations. By applying quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO), we design a flattened Luneburg lens to facilitate its seamless interface with the planar metasurface. The gradient index of the Luneburg lens is realized through additive manufacturing. We show that the flattened Luneburg lens with a reflective surface at the flattened focal plane is able to achieve diffraction-limited retroreflection, enabling long-range backscatter communication. When an interrogator transmits towards the metasurface-backed Luneburg lens, the device can modulate the reflected signal phase across a wide field of regard to communicate data. We experimentally show that the spatial control over the metasurface allows different bit streams to be simultaneously communicated in different directions. Additionally, we show that the device is able to prevent eavesdroppers from receiving information, thus securing communications.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-velocity laser pulses in plasma waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time structured laser pulses feature an intensity peak that can travel at an arbitrary velocity while maintaining a near-constant profile. These pulses can propagate in uniform media, where their frequencies are correlated with continuous transverse wavevectors, or in structured media, such as a waveguide, where their frequencies are correlated with discrete mode numbers. Here, we demonstrate the formation and propagation of arbitrary-velocity laser pulses in a plasma waveguide where the intensity can be orders of magnitude higher than in a solid-state waveguide. The flexibility to control the velocity of the peak intensity in a plasma waveguide enables new configurations for plasma-based sources of radiation and energetic particles, including THz generation, laser wakefield acceleration, and direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the moir\'e twist angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e multilayers offer a promising platform for engineering diverse functionalities in a single material via twist angle control. However, achieving reliable, high-precision control of the twist angle remains challenging. In this theoretical work, we propose an all-optical method for fast, precise manipulation of two-dimensional multilayers by transferring orbital angular momentum from phase-structured light (e.g. vortex beams) to a 2D material flake. We model the light-matter interaction, analyze the twist dynamics, and develop a phase diagram for optical twist angle switching -- transition to a neighboring metastable twist angle -- by mapping the system onto an impulsively forced nonlinear pendulum. Aided by pairwise classical potential estimates for the interlayer energy and numerical simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with hexagonal boron nitride bilayers and extend the results to dichalcogenides with first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical response -- from single-pulse twist angle control to high-order quasistable orbits pointing toward periodically driven chaotic dynamics -- and suggest a pathway for all-optical measurement of the twist potential energy. These results can be generalized to other 2D multilayers, paving the way for scalable and customizable moir\'e electronics and photonics.</description>

      <title>Scattering graph method for 3D radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel method for monochromatic scalar 3D radiative transfer, designed primarily for modelling remote sensing imaging, is presented. For simulating an observation of an imaging satellite instrument, the method uses a heuristic scattering coupling function to model the inter-pixel scattering of radiation, which is represented with a graph. The GPU-capable code implementation of the method, TURSCA, was validated against two established 3D RT models, Siro and SHDOM with relative agreement at 3% and 6%, respectively. The method opens up new avenues of research, especially in satellite-based remote sensing of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of exoplanets in face-on orbits using vortex filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to detect exoplanets based on their host star's intensity centroid after it passes thru a vortex filter. Based on our calculations with planets in face-on orbits, exoplanets with relative proximity to their host stars and with low mass ratios ($m_p/m_s$) can have discernible signals that can be amplified by the topological charge $\ell$ of the vortex filter. For exoplanets that have higher mass ratios and are far from their host stars, a clear signal can also be obtained but these are not affected by the value of $\ell$ and other planet detection methods may be more suitable. We present a simple table-top optical experiment to support our calculations. Our proposed method adds to the arsenal of techniques for astrometric exoplanet detection.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Effect Improves Quantum Battery Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</description>

      <title>Real-time simulations of laser-induced electron excitations in crystalline ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium electron dynamics in crystalline ZnO induced by ultrashort, relatively intense, infrared laser pulses. Our focus is on understanding the mechanism that facilitates efficient conduction band population in ZnO to enable optically pumped lasing. We consider two different pulse frequencies (in the near-infrared and mid-infrared) for which experimental data are available, and we calculate the electronic response of a ZnO crystal for a wide range of pulse intensities. We apply and compare three complementary theoretical approaches: the analytical Keldysh model, the numerical solution of the semiconductor Bloch equations, and real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We conclude that time-dependent density functional theory is a valid \textit{ab initio} approach for predicting conduction band population, that offers an accurate enough description of static and transient optical properties of solids and provides physics insight into the intermediate excitation regime, where electronic excitations are determined by the interplay of intraband tunneling, a consequence of band bending, and interband multi-photon absorption.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature waveguide-integrated photodetector using bolometric effect for mid-infrared spectroscopy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveguide-integrated mid-infrared (MIR) photodetectors are pivotal components for the development of molecular spectroscopy applications, leveraging mature photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technologies. Despite various strategies, critical challenges still remain in achieving broadband photoresponse, cooling-free operation, and large-scale complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible manufacturability. To leap beyond these limitations, the bolometric effect - a thermal detection mechanism - is introduced into the waveguide platform. More importantly, we pursue a free-carrier absorption (FCA) process in germanium (Ge) to create an efficient light-absorbing medium, providing a pragmatic solution for full coverage of the MIR spectrum without incorporating exotic materials into CMOS. Here, we present an uncooled waveguide-integrated photodetector based on a Ge-on-insulator (Ge-OI) PIC architecture, which exploits the bolometric effect combined with FCA. Notably, our device exhibits a broadband responsivity of 28.35 %/mW across 4030-4360 nm (and potentially beyond), challenging the state of the art, while achieving a noise-equivalent power of $4.03$x$10^{-7} W/Hz^{0.5}$ at 4180 nm. We further demonstrate label-free sensing of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) using our integrated photodetector and sensing waveguide on a single chip. This approach to room-temperature waveguide-integrated MIR photodetection, harnessing bolometry with FCA in Ge, not only facilitates the realization of fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems with wavelength flexibility but also provides a blueprint for MIR PICs with CMOS-foundry-compatibility.</description>

Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of materials at the nanoscale, offering unique insights into the behavior of photonic and plasmonic materials under electron excitation. We introduce an atlas of bulk CL spectra and intensity for a broad range of materials used in photonics and plasmonics. Through a combination of experimental CL microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize spectra and intensity of coherent and incoherent CL, electron penetration depth and energy deposition, offering a foundational reference for interpreting CL signals and understanding material behavior under electron excitation. Our atlas captures CL signals across a wide range of materials, offering valuable insight into intrinsic emission properties for informed material selection and device design in photonics and plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>Detectorless 3D terahertz imaging: achieving subwavelength resolution with reflectance confocal interferometric microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz imaging holds great potential for non-destructive material inspection, but practical implementation has been limited by resolution constraints. In this study, we present a single-pixel THz imaging system based on a confocal microscope architecture, utilising a quantum cascade laser as both transmitter and phase-sensitive receiver. Our approach integrates laser feedback interferometry detection to achieve a two-fold improvement in lateral resolution and a two-order-of-magnitude enhancement in axial resolution over conventional imaging through precise interferometric phase measurements. This translates to a lateral resolution near $\lambda/2$ and a depth of focus better than $\lambda/5$, significantly outperforming traditional confocal systems. The system can produce a 0.5 Mpixel image in under two minutes, surpassing both raster-scanning single-pixel and multipixel focal-plane array-based imagers. Coherent operation enables simultaneous amplitude and phase image acquisition, and a custom visualisation method links amplitude to image saturation and phase to hue, enhancing material characterisation. A 3D tomographic analysis of a silicon chip reveals subwavelength features, demonstrating the system's potential for high-resolution THz imaging and material analysis. This work sets a new benchmark for THz imaging, overcoming key challenges and opening up transformative possibilities for non-destructive material inspection and characterisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of systems ranging from molecular structures to distant galaxies. However, existing super-resolution methods require extensive calibration and retraining for each imaging setup, limiting their practical deployment. We introduce a device-agnostic deep-learning framework for super-resolution imaging of point-like emitters that eliminates the need for calibration data or explicit knowledge of optical system parameters. Our model is trained on a diverse, numerically simulated dataset encompassing a broad range of imaging conditions, enabling generalization across different optical setups. Once trained, it reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single resolution-limited camera frame with superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. We experimentally validate our approach using a custom microscopy setup with ground-truth emitter positions. We also demonstrate its versatility on astronomical and single-molecule localization microscopy datasets, achieving unprecedented resolution without prior information. Our findings establish a pathway toward universal, calibration-free super-resolution imaging, expanding its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient PCSEL Design: A Data-Driven Approach for Design Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven design approach for photonic crystals to achieve high efficiency in photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs). By discretizing the photonic crystal structure into a grid, we enable the generation of arbitrary lattice designs. Multiple fully connected layers combined with a position embedding module extract essential features from the photonic crystal designs, while coupled-wave theory (CWT) is used to evaluate the efficiency (based on the ratio of surface-emitting to edge-emitting resonant) and quality factor Q. We introduce the Neural Networks (NNs) model to evaluate the structures, and to find a better performance design according to the evaluation result. The model achieves high prediction accuracy, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.780 for SEE and 0.887 for the log-transformed Q. Additionally, we perform Shapley value analysis to identify the most important Fourier coefficients, providing insights into the factors that impact the performance of PCSEL designs. Our work speeds up the design process and offers valuable guidance for optimizing high-performance PCSELs, supporting the development of fully photonic design automation (PDA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in systems with symmetry is a cornerstone phenomenon accompanying second-order phase transitions. Here, we predict the opposite phenomenon, namely, spontaneous symmetry emergence in a system that lacks symmetry. In the example of two coupled oscillators interacting non-symmetrically with a set of oscillators whose frequencies uniformly fill a finite frequency range, we demonstrate that the system state can acquire symmetry that is not inherent in the system Hamiltonian. The emergence of symmetry is manifested as a change in the system dynamics, which can be interpreted as a phase transition in a Hermitian system that lacks symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a composite atom-cavity system interacting with a ring resonator. In such a structure, time crystal regime can be observed. We show that a quadratic observation time dependence of the system's sensitivity to perturbations takes place in the time crystal regime and also in the transition area to the normal state. This dependence is due to ability of the system to retain the memory of the atom's initial state. Outside these areas, the system is not able to retain the memory of the atom's initial state and the sensitivity scales linearly on the observation time. Our results open up a new way for implementation of discrete time crystals in sensing and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of multipulse solutions in mode-locked lasers in presence of time-delayed feedback stemming, e.g., from reflections upon optical elements, and carrier dynamics. We demonstrate that the dynamics of such a high dimensional problem can be successfully described by some effective equations of motion for the pulses' phases and positions. Analyzing the reduced vector field permits disclosing a highly complex dynamics where coherent and incoherent interactions compete. The latter lead to regimes in which pulses can be equidistant or non-equidistant and also have different phase relations. Multi-stability between regimes is also observed as well as emerging limit cycles and global heteroclinic bifurcations in phase space.</description>

Abstract: Here, we investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the point group symmetry, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.</description>
