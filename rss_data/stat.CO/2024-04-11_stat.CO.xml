      <title>A solution for the mean parametrization of the von Mises-Fisher distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The von Mises-Fisher distribution as an exponential family can be expressed in terms of either its natural or its mean parameters. Unfortunately, however, the normalization function for the distribution in terms of its mean parameters is not available in closed form, limiting the practicality of the mean parametrization and complicating maximum-likelihood estimation more generally. We derive a second-order ordinary differential equation, the solution to which yields the mean-parameter normalizer along with its first two derivatives, as well as the variance function of the family. We also provide closed-form approximations to the solution of the differential equation. This allows rapid evaluation of both densities and natural parameters in terms of mean parameters. We show applications to topic modeling with mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions using Bregman Clustering.</description>

      <title>SNSeg: An R Package for Time Series Segmentation via Self-Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series segmentation aims to identify potential change-points in a sequence of temporally dependent data, so that the original sequence can be partitioned into several homogeneous subsequences. It is useful for modeling and predicting non-stationary time series and is widely applied in natural and social sciences. Existing segmentation methods primarily focus on only one type of parameter changes such as mean and variance, and they typically depend on laborious tuning or smoothing parameters, which can be challenging to choose in practice. The self-normalization based change-point estimation framework SNCP by Zhao et al. (2022), however, offers users more flexibility and convenience as it allows for change-point estimation of different types of parameters (e.g. mean, variance, quantile and autocovariance) in a unified fashion, and requires effortless tuning. In this paper, the R package SNSeg is introduced to implement SNCP for segmentation of univariate and multivariate time series. An extension of SNCP, named SNHD, is also designed and implemented for change-point estimation in the mean vector of high-dimensional time series. The estimated changepoints as well as segmented time series are available with graphical tools. Detailed examples of SNSeg are given in simulations of multivariate autoregressive processes with change-points.</description>

      <title>From Poisson Observations to Fitted Negative Binomial Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test has been widely used for testing whether a random sample comes from a specific distribution, possibly with estimated parameters. If the data come from a Poisson distribution, however, one can hardly tell that they do not come from a negative binomial distribution by running a KS test, even with a large sample size. In this paper, we rigorously justify that the KS test statistic converges to zero almost surely, as the sample size goes to infinity. To prove this result, we demonstrate a notable finding that in this case the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the parameters of the negative binomial distribution converge to infinity and one, respectively and almost surely. Our result highlights a potential limitation of the KS test, as well as other tests based on empirical distribution functions (EDF), in efficiently identifying the true underlying distribution. Our findings and justifications also underscore the importance of careful interpretation and further investigation when identifying the most appropriate distributions in practice.</description>

      <title>Functional Regression Models with Functional Response: New Approaches and a Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new nonlinear approach for additive functional regression with functional response based on kernel methods along with some slight reformulation and implementation of the linear regression and the spectral additive model. The latter methods have in common that the covariates and the response are represented in a basis and so, can only be applied when the response and the covariates belong to a Hilbert space, while the proposed method only uses the distances among data and thus can be applied to those situations where any of the covariates or the response is not Hilbertian typically normed or even metric spaces with a real vector structure. A comparison of these methods with other procedures readily available in R is performed in a simulation study and in real datasets showing the results the advantages of the nonlinear proposals and the small loss of efficiency when the simulation scenario is truly linear. The comparison is done in the Hilbertian case as it is the only scenario where all the procedures can be compared. Finally, the supplementary material provides a visualization tool for checking the linearity of the relationship between a single covariate and the response and a link to a GitHub repository where the code and data are available.} %and an example considering that the response is not Hilbertian.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for particle gradient descent, and extensions of the log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD)~(Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that, for models satisfying a condition generalizing both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively), the flow converges exponentially fast to the set of minimizers of the free energy. We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying it to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I generalization holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error, obtaining non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.</description>
