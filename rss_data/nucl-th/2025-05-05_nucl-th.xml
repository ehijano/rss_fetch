      <title>Connecting Relativistic Density Functional Theory to Microscopic Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of systematic effective field theories (EFTs) for nuclear forces and advances in solving the nuclear many-body problem have greatly improved our understanding of dense nuclear matter and the structure of finite nuclei. For global nuclear calculations, density functional theories (DFTs) have been developed to reduce the complexity and computational cost required in describing nuclear systems. However, DFT often makes approximations and assumptions about terms included in the functional, which may introduce systematic uncertainties compared to microscopic calculations using EFTs. In this work, we investigate possible avenues of improving nuclear DFT using nonlinear relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory. We explore the impact of RMF model extensions by fitting the nonlinear RMF model to predictions of nuclear matter and selected closed-shell nuclei using four successful chiral EFT Hamiltonians. We find that these model extensions are impactful and important in capturing the physics present within chiral Hamiltonians, particularly for charge radii and neutron skins of closed-shell nuclei. However, there are additional effects that are not captured within the RMF model, particularly within the isoscalar sector of RMF theory. Additional model extensions and the reliability of the nonlinear RMF model are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger astrophysical data: The impacts of likelihood functions of low density matter constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate how the choice between Gaussian and uniform likelihood functions in Bayesian inference affects the inferred bulk properties of compact stars and nuclear matter within covariant density functional-based equations of state. To enable direct comparison between two approaches, we designed the uniform likelihood function with a Gaussian-equivalent normalization factor and marginalization behavior. Across three representative astrophysical scenarios, both approaches yield nearly identical mass-radius relations, density-pressure relations, and overlapping 95.4\% confidence level regions. We find significant variations in the predicted distributions of nuclear characteristics at nuclear saturation in the isoscalar channel, e.g., in nuclear compressibility $K_{\rm sat}$, whereas the isovector quantities, for example, proton fraction, are quite similar. Our results indicate that the influence of individual nuclear characteristics at saturation density on the global properties of compact stars is obscured by the integral nature of these quantities. This, in turn, underscores the need for dedicated nuclear experiments sensitive to these characteristics in order to better constrain their values.</description>

      <title>Expanded calculations of pn-QRPA electron capture rates on $^{55}$Co for presupernova and supernova physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its abundance and its relatively high capture rates, $^{55}$Co is one of the key nuclide that can control the dynamics of core collapse of a massive star. Previously we introduced our microscopic calculations of capture rates on $^{55}$Co using the proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) theory. Here we present for the first time an expanded calculation of the electron capture rates on $^{55}$Co on an extensive temperature-density scale. These type of scale is appropriate for interpolation purposes and of greater utility for simulation codes.</description>

      <title>Study of electron capture rates on chromium isotopes for core-collapse simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron capture rates on \emph{fp}-shell nuclei play a pivotal role in the dynamics of stellar evolution and core collapse. These rates play a crucial role in the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star activating the supernova explosion. As per simulation results, capture rates on chromium isotopes have a major impact on controlling the lepton-to-baryon fraction of the stellar core during the late phases of evolution of massive stars. In this paper we calculate the electron capture rates on isotopes of chromium with mass range $42\leq A \leq 65$, including neutron-deficient and neutron-rich isotopes. For the calculation of weak rates in stellar matter, we used the pn-QRPA model with separable Gamow-Teller forces and took deformation of nucleus into consideration. A recent study proved this form of pn-QRPA to be the best for calculation of GT strength distributions amongst the pn-QRPA models. The stellar weak rates are calculated over a broad range of temperature $(0.01 \times 10^{9}-30 \times 10^{9} (K))$ and density $(10-10^{11}(g/cm^{3}))$ domain. We compare our electron capture rates with the pioneering calculation of Fuller, Fowler, and Newman (FFN) and with the large-scale shell model (LSSM) calculation. Our electron capture rates are enhanced compared to the FFN and shell model rates.</description>

      <title>Gamma Ray Heating and Neutrino Cooling Rates due to Weak Interaction Processes on sd-shell Nuclei in Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma ray heating and neutrino cooling rates, due to weak interaction processes, on $sd$-shell nuclei in stellar core are calculated using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation theory. The recent extensive experimental mass compilation of \citep{Wang12}, other improved model input parameters including nuclear quadrupole deformation \citep{Ram01}, \citep{Mol16} and physical constants are taken into account in the current calculation. The purpose of this work is two fold, one is to improve the earlier calculation of weak rates performed by \citep{Nabi99} using the same theory. We further compare our results with previous calculations. The selected $sd$-shell nuclei, considered in this work, are of special interest for the evolution of O-Ne-Mg core in 8-10 M$_\odot$ stars due to competitive gamma ray heating rates and cooling by URCA processes. The outcome of these competitions is to determine, whether the stars end up as a white dwarf \citep{Nabi08}, an electron-capture supernova \citep{Jones13} or Fe core-collapse supernova \citep{Suz16}. The selected $sd$-shell nuclei for calculation of associated weak-interaction rates include $^{20,23}$O, $^{20,23}$F, $^{20,23,24}$Ne, $^{20,23-25}$Na, and $^{23-25}$Mg. The cooling and heating rates are calculated for density range ($10 \leq \rho($\;g.cm$^{-3}) \leq $ 10$^{11}$) and temperature range ($0.01\times10^{9}$ $\leq$ $\;T(K)$ $\leq$ $30\times10^{9}$). The calculated gamma heating rates are orders of magnitude bigger than the shell model rates (except for $^{25}$Mg at low densities). At high temperatures the gamma heating rates are in reasonable agreement. The calculated cooling rates are up to an order of magnitude bigger for odd-A nuclei.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure study using a hybrid approach of shell model and Gogny-type density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear density functional theory (DFT) is able to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter, as well as properties of finite nuclei. Consequently, the DFT calculations are applicable to nuclei across a wide range of masses on nuclear chart. The Gogny-type density functional, which is equivalent to the mean-field calculations with finite-range density-dependent effective interactions, is a successful example. In contrast, the shell-model (configuration-interaction) calculation is a powerful tool to describe nuclear structure, especially spectroscopic properties. The shell model is able to take into account correlations beyond mean field in a truncated model space. In this work, we report investigation on $\textit{sd}$-shell nuclei and Ca isotopes using a hybrid approach of the shell model and Gogny-type DFT.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Coulomb interaction on nuclear deformation and drip lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclei are self-bound systems in which the strong interaction (nuclear force) plays a dominant role and the isospin is approximately a good quantum number. The isospin symmetry is primarily violated by the electromagnetic interactions, namely the Coulomb interaction among protons, effects of which need be studied to understand importance of the isospin symmetry. We investigate the effect of the Coulomb interaction on nuclear properties, especially the quadrupole deformation and neutron drip line, utilizing the density functional method which provides a universal description of nuclear systems in the entire nuclear chart. We carry out calculations of even-even nuclei with the proton number 2 to 60. The results show that the Coulomb interaction plays a significant role in enhancing the quadrupole deformation across a wide range of nuclei. We also find that nuclei near the neutron drip line gain an additional binding energy by the Coulomb interaction, which may lead to a shift of the neutron drip line toward a larger neutron number.</description>

      <title>Deblurring fission fragment mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions provide valuable insights into the properties of fissioning systems and the dynamics of the fission process. Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment evaporation codes like \cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are always measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of prompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the emission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions requires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector efficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these experimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and a transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this method over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a sum of Gaussians, as in \cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass distributions. The results from deblurring are then used as inputs to \cgmf{}, and we compare the \cgmf{} results obtained using deblurring inputs with the default \cgmf{} results.</description>

      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into four pions within chiral effective field theory in the low energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ chiral effective field theory to study the process of electron-positron annihilation into four pions in the low energy region within $E_{c.m.}\leq 0.6$ GeV. The prediction of the cross-section is obtained through $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order, which is smaller than the experimental data in the energy region [0.6-0.65] GeV, though the data has only a few points and poor statistics. Then, the resonance chiral theory is applied to include the resonance contribution, with the lightest scalars and vectors written in the effective Lagrangians. A series of relevant decay widths and the masses of the vectors are studied to fix the unknown couplings. The resonance contribution should be one order larger than that of the chiral perturbation theory but still one to two orders smaller than the data.The significant discrepancy urged the new experimental measurements to give more guidance.We also compute the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution from the four pion channels to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$. In the energy range from threshold up to 0.6 GeV within RChT,the contributions are $a_\mu=(0.6678\pm0.0933)\times10^{-16}$ and $a_\mu=(0.4575\pm0.0517)\times10^{-16}$ for the processes of $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$, $\pi^0\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Holographic Heavy Quark Energy Loss in the Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, holographic calculations in strongly coupled plasma have provided separate descriptions for the rates of energy loss either for ultrarelativistic massless quarks and gluons or for infinitely massive quarks, with the latter calculation valid for $\sqrt{\gamma} &lt; M/(\sqrt{\lambda}T)$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz boost factor for a heavy quark with velocity $v$ and mass $M$ moving through plasma with 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ and temperature $T$. These two calculations should apply sequentially in the description of the energy loss of a heavy quark that starts out ultrarelativistic, loses energy, slows down, becomes non-relativistic at later times, and ultimately comes to rest and diffuses in the strongly coupled plasma. We provide an ansatz for uniquely incorporating both regimes to give an approximate but unified description of how a heavy quark that is initially ultrarelativistic loses energy all the way until it comes to rest. We implement this ansatz in the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model. With this new, consistent, treatment of heavy quark energy loss at strong coupling, we confront our predictions for the suppression and azimuthal anisotropies of D- and B-mesons, as well as B-tagged jets, with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Maximization and Mirror Symmetry in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 2-to-2 scatterings of Higgs bosons in a CP-conserving two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and study the implication of maximizing the entanglement in the flavor space, where the two doublets $\Phi_a$, $a=1,2$, can be viewed as a qubit: $\Phi_1=|0\rangle$ and $\Phi_2=|1\rangle$. More specifically, we compute the scattering amplitudes for $\Phi_a \Phi_b \to \Phi_c \Phi_d$ and require the outgoing flavor entanglement to be maximal for a full product basis such as the computational basis, which consists of $\{|00\rangle,|01\rangle,|10\rangle,|11\rangle\}$. In the unbroken phase and turning off the gauge interactions, entanglement maximization results in the appearance of an $U(2)\times U(2)$ global symmetry among the quartic couplings, which in general is broken softly by the mass terms. Interestingly, once the Higgs bosons acquire vacuum expectation values, maximal entanglement enforces an exact $U(2) \times U(2)$ symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to $U(1)\times U(1)$. As a byproduct, this gives rise to Higgs alignment as well as to the existence of 6 massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The $U(2)\times U(2)$ symmetry can be gauged to lift the massless Goldstones, while maintaining maximal entanglement demands the presence of a discrete $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry interchanging the two gauge sectors. The model is custodially invariant in the scalar sector, and the inclusion of fermions requires a mirror dark sector, related to the standard one by the $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Description of di-hadron saturation signals within a universal nuclear parton distribution function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Di-hadron and di-jet correlation measurements in proton-nucleus ($p$+A) and electron--nucleus collisions are widely motivated as sensitive probes of novel, non-linear QCD saturation dynamics in hadrons, which are particularly accessible in the dense nuclear environment at low values of Bjorken-$x$ ($x_\mathrm{A})$. Current measurements at RHIC and the LHC observe a significant suppression in the per-trigger yield at forward rapidities compared to that in proton-proton collisions, nominally consistent with the "mono-jet" production expected in a saturation scenario. However, the width of the azimuthal correlation remains unmodified, in contradiction to the qualitative expectations from this physics picture. I investigate whether the construction of these observables leaves them sensitive to effects from simple nuclear shadowing as captured by, for example, universal nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF) analyses. I find that modern nPDF sets, informed by recent precision measurements sensitive to the shadowing of low-$x_\mathrm{A}$ gluon densities in LHC and other data, can describe all or the majority of the di-hadron/jet suppression effects in $p$+A data at both RHIC and the LHC, while giving a natural explanation for why the azimuthal correlation width is unmodified. Notably, this is achieved via a $(x_\mathrm{A},Q^2)$-differential suppression of overall cross-sections only, without requiring additional physics dynamics which alter the inter-event correlations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the transverse-momentum dependent gluon distribution at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the colour dipole picture for photon-nucleus interactions at small $x$ together with the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory, we demonstrate that the next-to-leading (NLO) order corrections to the cross-section for the inclusive production of a pair of hard jets encode not only the JIMWLK evolution with decreasing $x$, but also the DGLAP evolution of the gluon distribution function and the CSS evolution of the gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution. The emergent CSS equation takes the form of a rate equation describing the evolution of the dijet distribution in the transverse momentum imbalance $K_\perp$ when increasing the dijet relative momentum $P_\perp$. All three types of evolution become important when both $P_\perp$ and $K_\perp$ are much larger than the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s(x)$ and we propose a framework which encompasses all of them. The solution to the JIMWLK equation provides the source term for the DGLAP evolution with increasing $K_\perp$, which in turn generates the initial condition for the CSS evolution with increasing $P_\perp$.</description>

Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the sea: universality of the transverse momentum dependent quark distributions at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we demonstrate that back-to-back dijet correlations in dilute-dense collisions involving a small-$x$ quark from the nuclear target can be factorised in terms of universal transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) for the sea quarks. Two building blocks are needed to construct all these TMDs at the operator level: the sea quark TMD operator which appears in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) or in the Drell-Yan process and the elastic $S$-matrix for a quark-antiquark dipole. Compared to SIDIS, the saturation effects are stronger for dijet production in forward proton-nucleus collisions, due to additional scattering in the initial and final state, effectively resulting in a larger value for the nuclear saturation momentum.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Scattering: Connections Across Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>

      <title>Phase Boundary of Nuclear Matter in Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear matter with a strong magnetic field is prevalent inside neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions. In a sufficiently large magnetic field the ground state is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons of the neutral pion field, or a domain-wall Skyrmion phase in which Skyrmions emerge inside the chiral solitons. In the region of large chemical potential and a magnetic field lower than its critical value for CSL, a Skyrmion crystal is expected to take up the ground state based on the chiral perturbation theory at the next leading order. We determine the phase boundary between such a Skyrmion crystal and the QCD vacuum. There was a conjecture that a magnetic field deforms the Skyrmion into a pancake shape whose boundary is a superconducting ring of charged pions. In contrast, through the exact Skyrmion solution, we find that the pancake conjecture holds approximately in a strong magnetic field, but fails for a weak one. We also validate that a Skyrmion would shrink to null without the Skyrme term, although Derrick's scaling law is modified by a background magnetic field, and the stability at the leading order is not ruled out in theory.</description>

      <title>A Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Here, we generalize some of these (to date theory-specific) insights to any quantum field theory at any coupling strength. Starting from quantum field theory first principles, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution. Remarkably, this condition reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>
