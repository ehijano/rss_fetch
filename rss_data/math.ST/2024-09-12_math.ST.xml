      <title>Quickest Change Detection Using Mismatched CUSUM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of quickest change detection (QCD) concerns design and analysis of algorithms to estimate in real time the time at which an important event takes place and identify properties of the post-change behavior. The goal is to devise a stopping time adapted to the observations that minimizes an $L_1$ loss.
  Approximately optimal solutions are well known under a variety of assumptions. In the work surveyed here we consider the CUSUM statistic, which is defined as a one-dimensional reflected random walk driven by a functional of the observations. It is known that the optimal functional is a log likelihood ratio subject to special statical assumptions.
  The paper concerns model free approaches to detection design, considering the following questions:
  1. What is the performance for a given functional of the observations?
  2. How do the conclusions change when there is dependency between pre- and post-change behavior?
  3. How can techniques from statistics and machine learning be adapted to approximate the best functional in a given class?</description>

      <title>On Admissibility in Bipartite Incidence Graph Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bipartite incidence graph sampling, the target study units may be formed as connected population elements, which are distinct to the units of sampling and there may exist generally more than one way by which a given study unit can be observed via sampling units. This generalizes ?nite-population element or multistage sampling, where each element can only be sampled directly or via a single primary sampling unit. We study the admissibility of estimators in bipartite incidence graph sampling and identify other admissible estimators than the classic Horvitz-Thompson estimator. Our admissibility results encompass those for ?nite-population sampling.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bounds in Distributed Point Target Tracking over Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification plays a key role in the development of autonomous systems, decision-making, and tracking over wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, there is a need of providing uncertainty confidence bounds, especially for distributed machine learning-based tracking, dealing with different volumes of data collected by sensors. This paper aims to fill in this gap and proposes a distributed Gaussian process (DGP) approach for point target tracking and derives upper confidence bounds (UCBs) of the state estimates. A unique contribution of this paper includes the derived theoretical guarantees on the proposed approach and its maximum accuracy for tracking with and without clutter measurements. Particularly, the developed approaches with uncertainty bounds are generic and can provide trustworthy solutions with an increased level of reliability. A novel hybrid Bayesian filtering method is proposed to enhance the DGP approach by adopting a Poisson measurement likelihood model. The proposed approaches are validated over a WSN case study, where sensors have limited sensing ranges. Numerical results demonstrate the tracking accuracy and robustness of the proposed approaches. The derived UCBs constitute a tool for trustworthiness evaluation of DGP approaches. The simulation results reveal that the proposed UCBs successfully encompass the true target states with 88% and 42% higher probability in X and Y coordinates, respectively, when compared to the confidence interval-based method.</description>

      <title>Ratio Divergence Learning Using Target Energy in Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Beyond Kullback--Leibler Divergence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ratio divergence (RD) learning for discrete energy-based models, a method that utilizes both training data and a tractable target energy function. We apply RD learning to restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are a minimal model that satisfies the universal approximation theorem for discrete distributions. RD learning combines the strength of both forward and reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) learning, effectively addressing the "notorious" issues of underfitting with the forward KLD and mode-collapse with the reverse KLD. Since the summation of forward and reverse KLD seems to be sufficient to combine the strength of both approaches, we include this learning method as a direct baseline in numerical experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that RD learning significantly outperforms other learning methods in terms of energy function fitting, mode-covering, and learning stability across various discrete energy-based models. Moreover, the performance gaps between RD learning and the other learning methods become more pronounced as the dimensions of target models increase.</description>

      <title>A model-based approach for clustering binned data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binned data often appears in different fields of research, and it is generated after summarizing the original data in a sequence of pairs of bins (or their midpoints) and frequencies. There may exist different reasons to only provide this summary, but more importantly, it is necessary being able to perform statistical analyses based only on it. We present a Bayesian nonparametric model for clustering applicable for binned data. Clusters are modeled via random partitions, and within them a model-based approach is assumed. Inferences are performed by a Markov chain Monte Carlo method and the complete proposal is tested using simulated and real data. Having particular interest in studying marine populations, we analyze samples of Lobatus (Strobus) gigas' lengths and found the presence of up to three cohorts along the year.</description>

      <title>Generalized Independence Test for Modern Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The test of independence is a crucial component of modern data analysis. However, traditional methods often struggle with the complex dependency structures found in high-dimensional data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel test statistic that captures intricate relationships using similarity and dissimilarity information derived from the data. The statistic exhibits strong power across a broad range of alternatives for high-dimensional data, as demonstrated in extensive simulation studies. Under mild conditions, we show that the new test statistic converges to the $\chi^2_4$ distribution under the permutation null distribution, ensuring straightforward type I error control. Furthermore, our research advances the moment method in proving the joint asymptotic normality of multiple double-indexed permutation statistics. We showcase the practical utility of this new test with an application to the Genotype-Tissue Expression dataset, where it effectively measures associations between human tissues.</description>

      <title>KL Convergence Guarantees for Score diffusion models under minimal data assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a new class of generative models that revolve around the estimation of the score function associated with a stochastic differential equation. Subsequent to its acquisition, the approximated score function is then harnessed to simulate the corresponding time-reversal process, ultimately enabling the generation of approximate data samples. Despite their evident practical significance these models carry, a notable challenge persists in the form of a lack of comprehensive quantitative results, especially in scenarios involving non-regular scores and estimators. In almost all reported bounds in Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence, it is assumed that either the score function or its approximation is Lipschitz uniformly in time. However, this condition is very restrictive in practice or appears to be difficult to establish. To circumvent this issue, previous works mainly focused on establishing convergence bounds in KL for an early stopped version of the diffusion model and a smoothed version of the data distribution, or assuming that the data distribution is supported on a compact manifold. These explorations have led to interesting bounds in either Wasserstein or Fortet-Mourier metrics. However, the question remains about the relevance of such early-stopping procedure or compactness conditions. In particular, if there exist a natural and mild condition ensuring explicit and sharp convergence bounds in KL. In this article, we tackle the aforementioned limitations by focusing on score diffusion models with fixed step size stemming from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and its kinetic counterpart. Our study provides a rigorous analysis, yielding simple, improved and sharp convergence bounds in KL applicable to any data distribution with finite Fisher information with respect to the standard Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: II. Central Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In descriptive statistics, $U$-statistics arise naturally in producing minimum-variance unbiased estimators. In 1984, Serfling considered the distribution formed by evaluating the kernel of the $U$-statistics and proposed generalized $L$-statistics which includes Hodges-Lehamnn estimator and Bickel-Lehmann spread as special cases. However, the structures of the kernel distributions remain unclear. In 1954, Hodges and Lehmann demonstrated that if $X$ and $Y$ are independently sampled from the same unimodal distribution, $X-Y$ will exhibit symmetrical unimodality with its peak centered at zero. Building upon this foundational work, the current study delves into the structure of the kernel distribution. It is shown that the $\mathbf{k}$th central moment kernel distributions ($\mathbf{k}&gt;2$) derived from a unimodal distribution exhibit location invariance and is also nearly unimodal with the mode and median close to zero. This article provides an approach to study the general structure of kernel distributions.</description>

      <title>Fusion regression methods with repeated functional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear regression and classification methods with repeated functional data are considered. For each statistical unit in the sample, a real-valued parameter is observed over time under different conditions related by some neighborhood structure (spatial, group, etc.). Two regression methods based on fusion penalties are proposed to consider the dependence induced by this structure. These methods aim to obtain parsimonious coefficient regression functions, by determining if close conditions are associated with common regression coefficient functions. The first method is a generalization to functional data of the variable fusion methodology based on the 1-nearest neighbor. The second one relies on the group fusion lasso penalty which assumes some grouping structure of conditions and allows for homogeneity among the regression coefficient functions within groups. Numerical simulations and an application of electroencephalography data are presented.</description>

      <title>SymmPI: Predictive Inference for Data with Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of predictions is a core problem in modern statistics. Methods for predictive inference have been developed under a variety of assumptions, often -- for instance, in standard conformal prediction -- relying on the invariance of the distribution of the data under special groups of transformations such as permutation groups. Moreover, many existing methods for predictive inference aim to predict unobserved outcomes in sequences of feature-outcome observations. Meanwhile, there is interest in predictive inference under more general observation models (e.g., for partially observed features) and for data satisfying more general distributional symmetries (e.g., rotationally invariant or coordinate-independent observations in physics). Here we propose SymmPI, a methodology for predictive inference when data distributions have general group symmetries in arbitrary observation models. Our methods leverage the novel notion of distributional equivariant transformations, which process the data while preserving their distributional invariances. We show that SymmPI has valid coverage under distributional invariance and characterize its performance under distribution shift, recovering recent results as special cases. We apply SymmPI to predict unobserved values associated to vertices in a network, where the distribution is unchanged under relabelings that keep the network structure unchanged. In several simulations in a two-layer hierarchical model, and in an empirical data analysis example, SymmPI performs favorably compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Estimability conditions for complex carryover effects in crossover designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued for many years that models used to analyze data from crossover designs are not appropriate when simple carryover effects are assumed. Furthermore, a statistical model that could estimate complex carry-over effects in crossover designs had never been found. However, in this paper, the estimability conditions of the complex carryover effects and a theoretical result that supports them are found. In addition, a simulation example is developed in a non-linear dose-response test for a typical AB/BA crossover design with repeated measures. This simulation shows that a semiparametric model can detect complex carryover effects and that this estimation improves the precision of the estimators of the treatment effect. It is concluded that when there are at least five replicates in each observation period per individual, semiparametric statistical models provide a good estimator of the treatment effect and reduce bias with respect to models that assume the absence of carryover effects or simplex carryover effects. Furthermore, an application of the methodology is shown and the wealth of analysis gained by estimating complex carryover effects is evident.</description>
