      <title>Inclined flow of a second-gradient incompressible fluid with pressure-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many viscous liquids behave effectively as incompressible under high pressures but display a pronounced dependence of viscosity on pressure. The classical incompressible Navier-Stokes model cannot account for both features, and a simple pressure-dependent modification introduces questions about the well-posedness of the resulting equations. This paper presents the first study of a second-gradient extension of the incompressible Navier-Stokes model, recently introduced by the authors, which includes higher-order spatial derivatives, pressure-sensitive viscosities, and complementary boundary conditions. Focusing on steady flow down an inclined plane, we adopt Barus' exponential law and impose weak adherence at the lower boundary and a prescribed ambient pressure at the free surface. Through numerical simulations, we examine how the flow profile varies with the angle of inclination, ambient pressure, viscosity sensitivity to pressure, and internal length scale.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of a Buoyant Jet Regime inside a Carbon-dioxide Ejector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ejectors are used in various engineering systems, including steam and vapor compression cycles. Optimizing the performance of ejectors requires understanding and analysis of multiphase and turbulent flow structures associated with their internal flow fields. This approach yields higher fidelity but at a high computational cost. Lower-fidelity one-dimensional (1D) models offer lower computational costs; however, 1D models are often empirical and provide limited understanding of the internal flow fields, overlooking possibilities of optimization. Ejector flows can be categorized into four regimes: Regime 1 (R1), which is compressibility dominated; Regime 2 (R2), which is interface instability driven; Regime 3 (R3), which is buoyancy dominated; and Regime 4 (R4), which is a wall-bounded turbulent jet expansion. Among these, the buoyancy-dominated regime is the most complex and least understood. This work discusses an approach to develop a reduced-order model utilizing a self-similarity framework to capture the internal flow field of the jet within the buoyancy-dominated regime under quasi-steady, compressible, and isothermal flow conditions, where density variations arise only from mixing. The density variation is captured through the Favre-averaging approach. The model captures the expansion of a central jet influenced by momentum diffusivity and a constant streamwise pressure gradient. Interaction of the central jet with the cylindrical wall induces a counterflow annular wall jet due to the combined effects of negative radial density gradients and shear stress imposed by the wall. Initially, the discussion focuses on flow topology inside the ejector, followed by the self-similarity methodology and implementation of asymptotic analysis. Finally, the resemblance...</description>

      <title>Particle deposit patterns from evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work investigates numerically the transport of colloidal particles within an evaporating sessile droplet and their deposition on the substrate in unfavourable conditions. The coupled phenomena of fluid flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change are modelled by taking into account for the evaporative cooling effect, the surface tension gradient effect at liquid air interface and the particles-substrate interaction effect due to DLVO attractive forces.The results show that in presence of the particles-substrate interaction, the outward radial internal flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving rise a ring like pattern with inner traces, while the thermal Marangoni internal flow reduces this effect giving rise a uniform deposit with a dark periphery.</description>

      <title>Impact of internal flow and particle-substrate interaction on deposit patterns during evaporation of a colloidal sessile droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our numerical study aims to investigate particle deposit patterns from the evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet. An in house finite volume code is developed to simulate the coupled phenomena of flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change of the evaporating droplet. The numerical model takes into account evaporative cooling effect, surface tension gradient effect at the liquid-air interface, thermal buoyancy effect inside the droplet, thermosolutal buoyancy effect in the surrounding air and electrical double layer and Van der Waals interactions between substrate and colloidal particles. Three models are used in this study: (a) a model that takes into account only the strong evaporation near the pinned contact line (b) a model that takes into account in addition the thermo capillary effect and (c) a comprehensive model that takes into account all effects. The results show that without heating the thermal buoyancy has a negligible effect on the formation of particle deposit. In presence of substrate-particle interactions, dominant radial flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving a ring-like pattern with inner traces, while the Marangoni flow reduces the coffee ring effect giving a uniform deposit with a dark periphery</description>

      <title>Resolving Turbulent Magnetohydrodynamics: A Hybrid Operator-Diffusion Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.</description>

      <title>Experimental evaluation of advanced control strategies for high-blockage cross-flow turbine arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In river or tidal channels, cross-flow turbines can achieve higher blockage ratios than other turbine variants, and are therefore able to achieve higher efficiencies. Here, we experimentally investigate how array control strategies might further influence the efficiency of a high-blockage dual-rotor cross-flow turbine array. Array performance is evaluated under coordinated constant speed control, uncoordinated torque control, and coordinated intracycle speed control at blockage ratios of 35% - 55%. In contrast to prior work at lower blockage, the evaluated control strategies do not yield significant improvements in efficiency and intracycle control is found to generally reduce array performance. While these results suggest limited benefits to more advanced control strategies at high blockage, this has the benefit of simplifying the system design space for array-level control.</description>

      <title>Predicting Flow-Induced Vibration in Isolated and Tandem Cylinders Using Hypergraph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite element-inspired hypergraph neural network framework for predicting flow-induced vibrations in freely oscillating cylinders. The surrogate architecture transforms unstructured computational meshes into node-element hypergraphs that encode higher-order spatial relationships through element-based connectivity, preserving the geometric and topological structure of the underlying finite-element discretization. The temporal evolution of the fluid-structure interaction is modeled via a modular partitioned architecture: a complex-valued, proper orthogonal decomposition-based sub-network predicts mesh deformation using a low-rank representation of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) grid displacements, while a hypergraph-based message-passing network predicts the unsteady flow field using geometry-aware node, element, and hybrid edge features. High-fidelity ALE-based simulations provide training and evaluation data across a range of Reynolds numbers and reduced velocities for isolated and tandem cylinder configurations. The framework demonstrates stable roll-outs and accurately captures the nonlinear variation of oscillation amplitudes with respect to reduced velocity, a key challenge in surrogate modeling of flow-induced vibrations. In the tandem configuration, the model successfully resolves complex wake-body interactions and multi-scale coupling effects, enabling accurate prediction of pressure and velocity fields under strong wake interference conditions. Our results show high fidelity in reproducing force statistics, dominant frequencies, and flow-field dynamics, supporting the framework's potential as a robust surrogate model for digital twin applications.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in viscoelastic fluids described by the Oldroyd-B model under small Deborah numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Proper Orthogonal Decomposition: a tool for educing advective wavepackets from flow field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travelling wavepackets are key coherent features contributing to the dynamics of several advective flows. This work introduces the Hilbert proper orthogonal decomposition (HPOD) to distil these features from flow field data, leveraging their mathematical representation as modulated travelling waves. The HPOD is a complex-valued extension of the proper orthogonal decomposition, where the Hilbert transform of the dataset is used to compute its analytic signal. Two versions of the technique are explored and compared: the conventional HPOD, computing the analytic signal in time; a novel space-only HPOD, computing it along the advection direction. The HPOD is shown to extract wavepackets with amplitude and frequency modulation in time and space. Its broadband nature offers an alternative to spectrally-pure decompositions when instantaneous, local wave characteristics are important. The space-only version, leveraging space/time equivalence in travelling waves to swap temporal operations by spatial ones, is proved mathematically equivalent to its conventional counterpart. The two HPOD versions are characterized and validated on three datasets ordered by complexity: a 2D-DNS of a laminar bluff-body wake with periodic vortex shedding; an LES of a turbulent jet with intermittent, highly modulated wavepackets; and a 2D-PIV of a turbulent jet with measurement errors and no temporal resolution. In advecting flows, both HPOD versions deliver practically identical complex-valued advecting wavepacket structures, characterized by spatiotemporal amplification and decay, wave modulation and intermittency phenomena in turbulent flow cases, such as in turbulent jets. The space-only variant allows to extract these structures from temporally under-resolved datasets, typical of snapshot particle image velocimetry.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Transient Growth Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient growth of disturbances made possible by the non-normality of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations plays an important role in bypass transition for many shear flows. Transient growth is typically quantified by the maximum energy growth among all possible initial disturbances, which is given by the largest squared singular value of the matrix exponential of the linearized Navier-Stokes operator. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to studying transient growth wherein we calculate optimal initial conditions, the resulting responses, and the corresponding energy growth directly from flow data. Mathematically, this is accomplished by optimizing the growth over linear combinations of input and output data pairs. We also introduce a regularization to mitigate the sensitivity to noisy measurements and unwanted nonlinearity. The data-driven method simplifies and broadens the application of transient growth analysis -- it removes the burden of writing a new code or linearizing an existing one, alleviates the computational expense for large problems, eliminates the challenge of obtaining a well-posed spatial propagator for spatial growth analyses, and enables the direct application of transient growth analysis to experimental data. We validate the data-driven method using a linearized Ginzburg-Landau model problem corrupted by process and measurement noise and obtain good agreement between the data-driven and the standard operator-based results. We then apply the method to study the spatial transient growth of disturbances in a transitional boundary layer using data from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database. Our method successfully identifies the optimal output response and provides plausible estimates of the transient spatial energy growth at various spanwise wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Computational Modelling of Thixotropic Multiphase Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase systems are ubiquitous in engineering, biology, and materials science, where understanding their complex interactions and rheological behavior is crucial for advancing applications ranging from emulsion stability to cellular phase separation. This study presents a numerical methodology for modeling thixotropic multiphase fluids, emphasizing the transient behavior of viscosity and the intricate interactions between phases. The model incorporates phase-dependent viscosities, interfacial tension effects, and the dynamics of phase separation, coalescence, and break-up, making it suitable for simulating systems with complex flow regimes. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to capture thixotropic behavior, where viscosity evolves over time due to microstructural changes induced by shear history. This approach enables the simulation of aging and recovery processes in materials such as gels, emulsions, and biological tissues. The model is rigorously validated against benchmark cases, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting multiphase systems under static and dynamic conditions. Subsequently, the methodology is applied to investigate systems with varying levels of microstructural evolution, revealing the impact of thixotropic dynamics on overall system behavior. The results provide new insights into the time-dependent rheology of multiphase fluids and highlight the versatility of the model for applications in industrial and biological systems involving complex fluid interactions.</description>

      <title>Learnable-Differentiable Finite Volume Solver for Accelerated Simulation of Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver, designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable margins.</description>

      <title>Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation</title>

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</description>

      <title>Radical scaling: beyond our feet and fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws arise and are eulogized across disciplines from natural to social sciences for providing pithy, quantitative, `scale-free', and `universal' power law relationships between two variables. On a log-log plot, the power laws display as straight lines, with a slope set by the exponent of the scaling law. In practice, a scaling relationship works only for a limited range, bookended by crossovers to other scaling laws. Leading with Taylor's oft-cited scaling law for the blast radius of an explosion against time, and by collating an unprecedented amount of datasets for laser-induced, chemical and nuclear explosions, we show distinct kinematics arise at the early and late stages. We illustrate that picking objective scales for the two axes using the transitions between regimes leads to the collapse of the data for the two regimes and their crossover, but the third regime is typically not mapped to the master curve. The objective scales permit us to abandon the arbitrarily chosen anthropocentric units of measurement, like feet for length and heart-beat for time, but the decimal system with ten digits (fingers) is still part of the picture. We show a remarkable collapse of all three regimes onto a common master curve occurs if we replace the base 10 by a dimensionless radix that combines the scales from the two crossovers. We also illustrate this approach of radical scaling for capillarity-driven pinching, coalescence and spreading of drops and bubbles, expecting such generalizations will be made for datasets across many disciplines.</description>

      <title>WaterLily.jl: A differentiable and backend-agnostic Julia solver for incompressible viscous flow around dynamic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers into optimization and machine-learning frameworks is hampered by the rigidity of classic computational languages and the slow performance of more flexible high-level languages. In this work, we introduce WaterLily.jl: an open-source incompressible viscous flow solver written in the Julia language. An immersed boundary method is used to enforce the effect of solid boundaries on flow past complex geometries with arbitrary motions. The small code base is multidimensional, multiplatform and backend-agnostic, ie. it supports serial and multithreaded CPU execution, and GPUs of different vendors. Additionally, the pure-Julia implementation allows the solver to be fully differentiable using automatic differentiation. The computational cost per time step and grid point remains constant with increasing grid size on CPU backends, and we measure up to two orders of magnitude speed-up on a supercomputer GPU compared to serial CPU execution. This leads to comparable performance with low-level CFD solvers written in C and Fortran on research-scale problems, opening up exciting possible future applications on the cutting edge of machine-learning research.</description>

      <title>IRENE: a fluId layeR finitE-elemeNt softwarE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-element software library, IRENE, for numerically solving the steady state and dynamics of a two-dimensional viscous fluid layer embedded in three-dimensional space, on multiple physical scales. The library is designed to handle a wide range of physical regimes -- both low-Reynolds-number and turbulent ones -- and geometries, capturing the coupling between in-plane flows, out-of-plane deformations, surface tension, and elastic response. In addition, the software can treat complex geometries, including those with intra-layer obstacles or arbitrary layer boundaries. We validate IRENE against known analytical and numerical results and demonstrate its capabilities through examples relevant to biological membranes and macroscopic air flows.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Finite-Time Fluctuation Relation in isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy generation rate in turbulence can be defined using the energy cascade rate as described in the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill equation at a specified length scale. The fluctuation relation (FR) from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which predicts exponential behaviour of the ratio of probability densities for positive and negative entropy production rates, was confirmed in prior work \citep{yao2023entropy}, but under certain limiting assumptions. We here examine the applicability of FR to isotropic turbulence under less stringent assumptions by analyzing entropy generation rates averaged over intervals ranging from one to several eddy turnover times. Based on time-resolved data at a Taylor-scale based Reynolds number $Re_\lambda = 433$, we find that the FR is valid in the sense that very close to exponential behaviour of probability ratios of positive and negative entropy generation (forward and inverse cascade of energy) is observed. Interestingly, finite-time averaging yields FR-consistent results only within a Lagrangian framework, along fluid trajectories using filtered convective velocities. In contrast, the FR does not hold with time-averaging at fixed (Eulerian) positions. Results provide evidence that the definition of entropy generation based on the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill equation describes turbulent cascade processes that exhibit properties predicted by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Origin of Friction Between Suspended Rough Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</description>
