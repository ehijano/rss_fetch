      <title>Overcoming error-in-variable problem in data-driven model discovery by orthogonal distance regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that promise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there remain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One reason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all noise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time derivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors). Recent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable problem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they are also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes no error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents assimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the model equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small yet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in both the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance regression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model selection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy, and assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63, Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that ODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the correct model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy method reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise contamination levels of up to 30%.</description>

      <title>On the lattice property of the Koopman operator spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has become a celebrated tool in modern dynamical systems theory for analyzing and interpreting both models and datasets. The linearity of the Koopman operator means that important characteristics about it, and in turn its associated nonlinear system, are captured by its eigenpairs and more generally its spectrum. Many studies point out that the spectrum of the Koopman operator has a multiplicative lattice structure by which eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be multiplied to produce new eigenpairs. However, these observations fail to resolve whether the new eigenfunction remains in the domain of the Koopman operator. In this work, we prove that the spectrum of the Koopman operator associated to discrete-time dynamical systems has a multiplicative lattice structure. We further demonstrate that the Koopman operator associated to discrete-time stochastic process does not necessarily have such a structure, demonstrating an important nuance that lies at the heart of Koopman operator theory.</description>

      <title>Tailored Forecasting from Short Time Series via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models can effectively forecast dynamical systems from time-series data, but they typically require large amounts of past data, making forecasting particularly challenging for systems with limited history. To overcome this, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting using Related Time Series (METAFORS), which generalizes knowledge across systems to enable forecasting in data-limited scenarios. By learning from a library of models trained on longer time series from potentially related systems, METAFORS builds and initializes a model tailored to short time-series data from the system of interest. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate that METAFORS can reliably predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics without requiring contextual labels. We see this even when test and related systems exhibit substantially different behaviors, highlighting METAFORS' strengths in data-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entropy and entanglement complexity in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>
