      <title>Quantum Howe duality and Schur duality of type AIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new connection between the iHowe duality of type AIII established by Luo-Xu and the iSchur duality established by Bao-Wang. We show that iweight $\overline{\rho}$ space in the iHowe duality is naturally isomorphic to the tensor space in the iSchur duality. Under this isomorphism, we show that the relative braid group action on this iweight space coincides with the action of the type B Hecke algebra in the iSchur duality. As a consequence, we derive from multiplicity-free decompositions that the iweight $\overline{\rho}$ spaces of irreducible modules over iquantum groups are irreducible modules over the type B Hecke algebra. Meanwhile, in the iHowe duality, we identify the relative braid group action from one side with the action of $K$-matrices and $R$-matrices from the other side.</description>

      <title>$R$-matrix Dunkl operators and spin Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a quantum integrable model which is an $R$-matrix generalization of the Calogero-Moser system, based on the Baxter-Belavin elliptic $R$-matrix. This is achieved by introducing $R$-matrix Dunkl operators so that commuting quantum spin Hamiltonians can be obtained from symmetric combinations of those. We construct quantum and classical $R$-matrix Lax pairs for these systems. In particular, we recover in a conceptual way the classical $R$-matrix Lax pair of Levin, Olshanetsky, and Zotov, as well as the quantum Lax pair found by Grekov and Zotov. Finally, using the freezing procedure, we construct commuting conserved charges for the associated quantum spin chain proposed by Sechin and Zotov, and introduce its integrable deformation. Our results remain valid when the Baxter-Belavin $R$-matrix is replaced by any of the trigonometric $R$-matrices found by Schedler and Polishchuk in their study of the associative Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Cardy limit of the 3d superconformal index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superconformal index $Z(q)$ of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories in Cardy-like limits $\beta = \log \tfrac{1}{q} \to 0^+$, extending techniques recently developed in the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ context. For theories with vectorlike matter content we find on the first sheet ($q \to 1$) that $Z(q) \sim \beta^{-\#}$, where the exponent $\#$ is determined by a $multiscale\ decomposition$ of the BPS moduli space appearing in the localization formula for the index. On the second sheet ($q \to e^{2\pi i})$ we find $Z(q) \sim e^{\#/ \beta}$, and that the long-standing puzzle of apparent gauge-enhancing saddles is resolved (in the absence of Chern--Simons couplings) via a novel $Lorentzian\ factorization$ formula that establishes complete screening.
  A key insight is the use of $Poisson\ resummation$, which streamlines the asymptotic analysis, sharpens the link to Kaluza--Klein effective field theory, and provides a dual description of parts of the BPS moduli space in terms of punctured surfaces. The Lorentzian factorization formula also emerges from Poisson resummation, though applied after a contour crossing in moduli space. This, in turn, hints at a correspondence between 3d monopoles and vortices via 2d duality.</description>

      <title>Conformal blocks are quasi-geometric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bundles with flat connections on configuration spaces associated to braided fusion categories, as well as the bundles with flat connections on moduli spaces of curves (conformal blocks) associated to modular fusion categories, are defined over number fields. The proof relies on Ocneanu rigidity. This result answers a conjecture of Etingof and Varchenko. Furthermore, we show that for a fixed braided or modular category, all the associated bundles with flat connections and their compatibilities (i.e., the braided or modular functor) can be defined over the same number field.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Strong, Topologically Meaningful and Fun Knot Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18456v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a pair of polynomial knot invariants $\Theta=(\Delta,\theta)$ which is:
  * Theoretically and practically fast: $\Theta$ can be computed in polynomial time. We can compute it in full on random knots with over 300 crossings, and its evaluation at simple rational numbers on random knots with over 600 crossings.
  * Strong: Its separation power is much greater than the hyperbolic volume, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and Khovanov homology (taken together) on knots with up to 15 crossings (while being computable on much larger knots).
  * Topologically meaningful: It likely gives a genus bound, and there are reasons to hope that it would do more.
  * Fun: Scroll to Figures 1.1-1.4, 3.1, and 6.2.
  $\Delta$ is merely the Alexander polynomial. $\theta$ is almost certainly equal to an invariant that was studied extensively by Ohtsuki, continuing Rozansky, Kricker, and Garoufalidis. Yet our formulas, proofs, and programs are much simpler and enable its computation even on very large knots.</description>

      <title>Virtual Quantum Markov Chain of four-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the framework of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs) from tripartite systems to the four-qubit setting. Structural criteria such as the kernel-inclusion condition are analyzed, showing that they are necessary but not sufficient for the existence of a valid recovery map. By explicit examples, we demonstrate that the four-qubit W state admits a recovery channel and thus qualifies as a VQMC, while the GHZ state does not. We further provide semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations to test recoverability and quantify sampling overhead, and establish the non-convexity of the VQMC set through mixed-state counterexamples. These results supply both theoretical insights and computational tools for studying correlations and recoverability in multipartite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Center of stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras: even roots of unity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the center of quantum tori appearing in quantum higher Teichm\"uller theory when the quantum parameter is an even root of unity. This is a subsequent of the work in the odd roots of unity case. The centers of the quantum tori help to understand those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras via quantum trace maps. Moreover, we compute the PI-degree of the quantum tori, which are the same with those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras. As corollaries, we give matrix decompositions for anti-symmetric integer matrices for the quantum tori.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Perspective on Braid Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, i.e. strict monoidal functors $F\colon B\rightarrow Mat$ from the braid category $B$ to the category of matrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the (constant) Yang-Baxter equation. A major part of the contribution here is to introduce, compare, and contrast suitable notions of isomorphism of representations. A significant contribution here is an extensive range of key examples and counterexamples.
  Our approach is mainly motivated by the recent classification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which the target $Mat$ is replaced by the subcategory $Match^N$. One objective is to understand from the categorical perspective how the classification was facilitated by this change (with the aim of generalising). Progress is made here by observing that the category of functors $MonFun(B,Mat)$ is itself a monoidal category (Theorem 5.3). In addition, we introduce the notion of sub and quotient objects, proving that an object that is both sub and quotient corresponds to an endomorphism in $MonFun(B,Mat)$ (Theorem 5.18). We also observe that objects with target $Match^N$ always have sub and quotient objects. This monoidal category leads us to consider monoidal subcategories whose objects share a given property, giving rise to a new way to see how group-type and involutive solutions, for example, fit into our framework.
  Another objective is to understand how universal such a restricted target is. Here we give various properties exposing the implications of different choices of equivalence and describe some relationships among them (Theorem 7.18, Theorem 7.9, Conj. 7.19, Conj. 7.22).
  A key result of this paper is Th.2.9, which shows that, in a `sufficiently free' setting including our case, every monoidal functor is equivalent to a strict one.</description>

      <title>Higher level BGG reciprocity for current algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a higher-level analogue of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) reciprocity for twisted current algebras for each positive integer, which recovers the original one (established by Bennett, Berenstein, Chari, Ion, Khoroshkin, Loktev, and Manning) as its level-one case. This work brings theta functions and modular forms into the theory of symmetric polynomials. Furthermore, we establish branching properties for both versions of Demazure modules and provide a new interpretation of level-restricted generalized Kostka polynomials in terms of symmetric polynomials.</description>
