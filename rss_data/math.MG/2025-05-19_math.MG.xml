      <title>Asymptotics of Constrained Quantization for Compactly Supported Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the asymptotics of high-rate constrained quantization errors for a compactly supported probability measure P on Euclidean spaces whose quantizers are confined to a closed set S. The key tool is the metric projection of K onto S that assigns each source point to its nearest neighbor in S, allowing the errors to be transferred to the projection, where K = supp P. For the upper estimate, we establish a projection pull-back inequality that bounds the errors by the classical covering radius of the projection. For the lower estimate, a weighted distance function enables us to perturb any quantizer element lying on the projection slightly into the complement in S without enlarging the error, provided the projection is nowhere dense (automatically true when S and K are disjoint). Under mild conditions on the pushforward measure of P by T, obtained via a measurable selector T, we derive a uniform lower bound. If this set is Ahlfors regular of dimension d, the error decays like the reciprocal of the d-th root of n and every constrained quantization dimension equals d. The two estimates coincide, giving the first complete dimension comparison formula for constrained quantization and closing the gap left by earlier self-similar examples by Pandey-Roychowdhury while extending classical unconstrained theory to closed constraints under mild geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Minimal dispersion on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal spherical cap dispersion ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ is the largest number $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ such that, no matter how $n$ points are distributed on the $d$-dimensional Euclidean unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, there is always a spherical cap with normalized area $\varepsilon$ not containing any of the points. We study the behavior of ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ as $n$ and $d$ grow to infinity. We develop connections to the problems of sphere covering and approximation of the Euclidean unit ball by inscribed polytopes. Existing and new results are presented in a unified way. Upper bounds on ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ result from choosing the points independently and uniformly at random and possibly adding some well-separated points to close large gaps. Moreover, we study dispersion with respect to intersections of caps.</description>

      <title>A naive generalization of the hyperbolic metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the hyperbolic metric enjoys many interesting properties but it is not defined in arbitrary subdomains in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$. The aim of this article is to introduce a hyperbolic-type metric that gives a new way to resolve the above problem. The new metric coincides with the hyperbolic metric on a ball and surprisingly matches with the quasihyperbolic metric not only in half-spaces but also in any unbounded domains. We calculate the density of the metric in some classical domains with some discussions on the curvature. A few characterizations of uniform domains and John disks in terms of this newly defined metric follow immediately. We also study some geometric properties of the metric including the existence of geodesics and the minimal length of a non-trivial closed curve in a multiply connected domains.</description>

      <title>Spherical quadrilateral with three right angles and its application for diameter of extreme points of a convex body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a theorem on the relationships between the lengths of sides of a spherical quadrilateral with three right angles. They are analogous to the relationships in the Lambert quadrilateral in the hyperbolic plane. We apply this theorem in the proof of our second theorem that if $C$ is a two-dimensional spherical convex body of diameter $\delta \in (\frac{1}{2}\pi,\pi)$, then the diameter of the set of extreme points of $C$ is at least $2 \arccos \big(\frac{1}{4}(\cos \delta + \sqrt {\cos^2 \delta +8})\big)$. This estimate cannot be improved.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Euclidean Steinitz problem may be reduced to its restriction to ``nearly unit'' vectors at the cost of an additive $O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{d}{\log d}}\Big)$ error.</description>

      <title>The Lonely Runner Conjecture turns 60</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture originated in Diophantine approximation will turn 60 in 2028. Even if the conjecture is still widely open, the flow of partial results, innovative tools and connections to different problems and applications has been steady on its long life. This survey attempts to give a panoramic view of the status of the problem, trying to highlight the contributions of the many papers that it has originated.</description>
