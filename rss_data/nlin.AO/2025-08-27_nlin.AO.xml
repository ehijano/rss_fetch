      <title>Fractal Illusions: An Experimental Study of Long-Range Sentence-Length Correlations in Randomly Generated Natural Language Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study re-evaluates the assumption that long-range correlations in sentence length are a fundamental feature of natural language and a marker of literary style. While previous research has suggested that punctuation marks--particularly full stops--generate structural regularities in narrative texts, our experiments challenge this view. Using Chinese as the primary language, supplemented with English, we constructed randomized linguistic sequences through three distinct methods. Surprisingly, these randomized texts also exhibit long-range correlations in sentence length, some even with stronger fractal characteristics than those found in canonical literary works. These findings suggest that the presence of long-range correlations in sentence length is not sufficient to indicate authorial intention, structural depth, or literary value. We argue that punctuation-induced long-range correlations have limited value for literary stylistic analysis and cannot be considered a fundamental characteristic of human writing.</description>

      <title>Modeling the evolution of collective synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group synchrony in the animal kingdom is usually associated with mating. Being in sync is likely advantageous, as it may help in luring the opposite sex. Yet there are also disadvantages -- such as the homogenization of the group -- which make it harder for individuals to stand-out. Here we address this tradeoff, bringing together the Kuramoto model with concepts from evolutionary game theory. We focus on the existence of self-interested ''cheaters,'' which have been extensively studied in a variety of species. In our scenario, cheating individuals take part in the synchronous group display but position themselves (in terms of phase) slightly ahead or behind the pack. This allows them to enjoy both the group benefit of advertisement and the individual benefit of being unique. But a group can only tolerate a limited number of such individuals while still achieving synchrony. We therefore incorporate a from of ''policing'' into our model: if an individual strays too far from the group's synchronous phase, they reveal themselves as dishonest and are punished. Our model offers testable predictions regarding natural population compositions, and will hopefully spur further investigation into not only how, but also why, natural systems synchronize.</description>

      <title>Wave coarsening drives time crystallization in active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When metals are magnetized, emulsions phase separate, or galaxies cluster, domain walls and patterns form and irremediably coarsen over time. Such coarsening is universally driven by diffusive relaxation toward equilibrium. Here, we discover an inertial counterpart - wave coarsening - in active elastic media, where vibrations emerge and spontaneously grow in wavelength, period, and amplitude, before a globally synchronized state called a time crystal forms. We observe wave coarsening in one- and two-dimensional solids and capture its dynamical scaling. We further arrest the process by breaking momentum conservation and reveal a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear analogue to chiral topological edge modes. Our work unveils the crucial role of symmetries in the formation of time crystals and opens avenues for the control of nonlinear vibrations in active materials.</description>

      <title>Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>
