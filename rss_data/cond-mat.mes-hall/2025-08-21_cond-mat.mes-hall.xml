      <title>Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley moir\'e systems using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828 (2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moir\'e materials using twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure. While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an interlayer bias due to an electric displacement field, this work shows that both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias strongly modify the moir\'e bands. For small twist angles, the density of states as a function of filling and interlayer bias shows qualitatively different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned ($60^\circ$) stacking. More interestingly, the Van Hove singularity becomes pinned to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping, an effect known to enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. For aligned stacking this occurs only at zero electric field, while for antialigned stacking this happens both at zero and finite field. Our work demonstrates that correlated states in $M$-valley 1TtTMDs can be strongly tuned \textit{in situ} both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.</description>

      <title>Jahn-Teller-like Distortion in a One-dimensional {\pi}-Conjugated Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structurally distorting low-dimensional {\pi}-conjugated systems can profoundly influence their electronic properties, but controlling such behavior in extended-width systems remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that a one-dimensional conjugated polymer, poly-(difluorenoheptalene-ethynylene) (PDFHE), undergoes a pronounced out-of-plane backbone distortion, equivalent to a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of its mirror symmetry. We synthesized PDFHE on noble metal surfaces and characterized its structure and electronic states using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Rather than adopting a planar, high-symmetry conformation, PDFHE relaxes into non-planar isomers stabilized by a Jahn-Teller-like mechanism that relieves an electronic instability relative to the gapped planar structure. Density functional theory calculations corroborate these findings, revealing that distortion lowers the total polymer energy and enlarges the bandgap, providing a microscopic explanation for the SSB. Our results show that even in mechanically robust extended {\pi}-systems, subtle electron-lattice coupling can spontaneously drive significant structural rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Influence of local strain on the optical probing of a Ni$^{2+}$ spin in a charged self-assembled quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the optical properties of quantum dots doped with a Ni$^{2+}$ ion that interacts with a charged exciton. Systematic magneto-optical analysis reveals that the strain distribution at the Ni$^{2+}$ site significantly influences its spin structure. In positively charged dots dominated by in-plane biaxial strain, the three spins states of the Ni$^{2+}$ (S$_z$=0, S$_z$=$\pm$1) can be observed and the magneto-optical spectra enables a local strain anisotropy to be determined. However, in most of the dots, lower-symmetry strain mixes all the Ni$^{2+}$ spin states, thereby increasing the number of observed optical transitions. In charged dots, we identify optical transitions that share a common excited state. They form a series of $\Lambda$ levels systems that can be individually addressed optically to determine the energy level structure. Magneto-optical measurements demonstrate that the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic and considerably stronger than the electron-Ni$^{2+}$ interaction. A spin-effective model that incorporates local strain orientation can successfully reproduce key experimental results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that low-symmetry terms in the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction must be considered in order to accurately describe the emission spectra details in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Fabrication, characterization and mechanical loading of Si/SiGe membranes for spin qubit devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Si/SiGe heterostructures on bulk Si substrates have been shown to host high fidelity electron spin qubits. Building a scalable quantum processor would, however, benefit from further improvement of critical material properties such as the valley splitting landscape. Flexible control of the strain field and the out-of-plane electric field $\mathcal{E}_z$ may be decisive for valley splitting enhancement in the presence of alloy disorder. We envision the Si/SiGe membrane as a versatile scientific platform for investigating intervalley scattering mechanisms which have thus far remained elusive in conventional Si/SiGe heterostructures and have the potential to yield favourable valley splitting distributions. Here, we report the fabrication of locally-etched, suspended SiGe/Si/SiGe membranes from two different heterostructures and apply the process to realize a spin qubit shuttling device on a membrane for future valley mapping experiments. The membranes have a thickness in the micrometer range and can be metallized to form a back-gate contact for extended control over the electric field. To probe their elastic properties, the membranes are stressed by loading with a profilometer stylus at room temperature. We distinguish between linear elastic and buckling modes, each offering new mechanisms through which strain can be coupled to spin qubits.</description>

      <title>The heating and cooling of 2D electrons at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the cooling length $\ell_E$ for hot electrons in a GaAs-based high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The thermal measurements are performed on a long 60 $\mu$m-wide channel, which is Joule-heated at one end, along which there are three similar hot-electron thermocouples, spaced 30 $\mu$m apart. The thermocouples measure an exponentially decaying temperature profile with a characteristic length $\ell_E$, which decreases from 23 to 16 $\mu$m as the lattice temperature increases from 1.8 to 5 K. From a simple one-dimensional model of heat diffusion, we measure an inelastic scattering time which decreases from $\tau_i \approx$ 0.36 to 0.18 ns. The measured $\tau_i$ has a magnitude and temperature dependence consistent with acoustic phonon scattering times. We discuss how the sample design can be varied for further thermal investigations. Knowledge of the temperature profile and its gradient will prove useful in measurements of the thermal conductivity and the Nernst effect.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Linear Response from Zeeman Quantum Geometry in 2D Unconventional Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional magnets with zero net magnetization yet momentum-dependent spin splitting constitute a newly identified class of materials that provide a rich platform for quantum-geometry-driven transport phenomena. Exploiting the interplay between momentum translation and spin rotation, we uncover a distinct linear transport response governed by a generalized quantum geometric tensor, the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor (ZQGT). We show that the ZQGT drives a linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in the three prototypical two-dimensional unconventional magnets: a time-reversal-broken $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ altermagnet, a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, and a mixed $d$-wave altermagnet. Depending on symmetry, these magnets exhibit longitudinal, transverse, or combined conduction and displacement IGMCs in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Notably, this response persists even when conventional Berry curvature contributions vanish, offering a unique probe of hidden spin-split band structures of unconventional magnets. In particular, for mixed $d$-wave altermagnets, symmetric Berry curvature and antisymmetric quantum metric respectively generate longitudinal conduction IGMC and transverse displacement IGMC- responses absent in conventional quantum geometry. The predicted signatures, relevant to compounds such as RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe, provide experimentally accessible diagnostics for distinguishing unconventional magnetic phases. These findings position the ZQGT as a powerful framework for probing and controlling transport in next-generation quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Near-resonant nuclear spin detection with megahertz mechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical resonators operating in the megahertz range have become a versatile platform for fundamental and applied quantum research. Their exceptional properties, such as low mass and high quality factor, make them also appealing for force sensing experiments. In this work, we propose a method for detecting, and ultimately controlling, nuclear spins by coupling them to megahertz resonators via a magnetic field gradient. Dynamical backaction between the sensor and an ensemble of $N$ nuclear spins produces a shift in the sensor's resonance frequency. The mean frequency shift due to the Boltzmann polarization is challenging to measure in nanoscale sample volumes. Here, we show that the fluctuating polarization of the spin ensemble results in a measurable increase of the resonator's frequency variance. On the basis of analytical as well as numerical results, we predict that the variance measurement will allow single nuclear spin detection with existing resonator devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling Skyrmion Lattice Orientation with Local Magnetic Field Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control over the formation and arrangement of magnetic skyrmion lattices is essential for understanding their emergent behavior and advancing their integration into spintronic and magnonic devices. We report on a simple and minimally invasive technique to nucleate and manipulate skyrmion lattices in soft magnetic CoFeB using single-pass magnetic force microscopy (MFM). By tuning the scan-line spacing to match the intrinsic stripe domain periodicity, the stray field gradient from the MFM tip induces reversible transitions from stripe domains to isolated skyrmions and locally ordered lattices. The resulting skyrmion positions are extracted to compute the local orientational order parameter $\psi_6$, enabling quantitative evaluation of lattice ordering. A systematic improvement in $\langle |\psi_6| \rangle$ is observed with repeated scanning, indicating a transition from a disordered state to ordered hexagonal lattices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the lattice orientation can be deterministically rotated by changing the scanning direction, as confirmed by both real-space analysis and fast Fourier transformations. This method enables the controlled creation, reordering, and deletion of metastable skyrmion textures on demand. Our approach establishes a practical and accessible platform for studying two-dimensional phase behavior in topological spin systems, offering direct and reconfigurable control over lattice symmetry, order, and orientation.</description>

      <title>Core position-dependent gyrotropic and damping contributions to the Thiele equation approach for accurate spin-torque vortex oscillator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic vortices in spin-torque vortex oscillators (STVOs) is essential for their application in neuromorphic computing. Existing models either rely on the standard Thiele equation approach (TEA), which offer only qualitative predictions, or on micromagnetic simulations (MMS), which are computationally demanding. We present a refined Thiele approach that incorporates the deformation of the vortex profile for the evaluation of the gyrotropic and damping terms. In this manuscript, a more realistic ansatz of the vortex magnetization profile is introduced to extract these effective parameters semi-analytically. A method to extract the gyrotropic and damping terms directly from MMS is also presented. The resulting expressions are benchmarked against state-of-the-art analytical derivations, and reveal a damping anisotropy of the vortex core. This framework captures the essential nonlinearities of STVO dynamics with high fidelity at low computational cost, paving the way for predictive modeling of large-scale neuromorphic circuits based on STVOs.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Deterministic time rewinding of waves in time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal modulation of material parameters offers unprecedented control over wave dynamics, enabling phenomena beyond the capabilities of static systems. Here we introduce and analyze a robust mechanism for time rewinding, whereby a temporally evolved wave is fully restored to its original state through a carefully engineered sequence of temporal modulations. In electromagnetic systems, time rewinding emerges from impedance-matched or anti-matched hierarchical bilayer structures with matched modulation durations, exploiting total transmission or reflection and reversed phase accumulation. In Dirac systems, it arises via complete interband transition driven by time-dependent vector potentials. Unlike time-reversal holography or quantum time mirrors, which produce wave echoes but only partial waveform recovery, our approach achieves deterministic and complete reconstruction of the entire wave state, including both amplitude and phase. Analytical conditions for robust amplitude and phase restoration are derived and validated through simulations of discrete and continuous modulations, demonstrating resilience to modulation complexity and temporal asymmetry. These findings establish a versatile platform for secure information retrieval, temporal cloaking, programmable metamaterials, and wave-based logic devices.</description>

      <title>From Chiral Topological Dynamics to Chiral Topological Amplification: Real vs Imaginary Parameters in a Hermitian Bosonic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Hermitian quadratic bosonic model (QBH) whose dynamical matrix exhibits distinct topological and dynamical phenomena depending on whether the hopping and pairing amplitudes are real or purely imaginary. In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the M\"obius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schr\"odinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the M\"obius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the M\"obius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Emergent Self-propulsion of Skyrmionic Matter in Synthetic Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propulsion plays a crucial role in biological processes and nanorobotics, enabling small systems to move autonomously in noisy environments. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a bound skyrmion-skyrmion pair in a synthetic antiferromagnetic bilayer can function as a self-propelled topological object, reaching speeds of up to a hundred million body lengths per second--far exceeding those of any known synthetic or biological self-propelled particles. The propulsion mechanism is triggered by the excitation of back-and-forth relative motion of the skyrmions, which generates nonreciprocal gyrotropic forces, driving the skyrmion pair in a direction perpendicular to their bond. Remarkably, thermal noise induces spontaneous reorientations of the pair and momentary reversals of the propulsion, mimicking behaviors observed in motile bacteria and microalgae.</description>

      <title>Trion polaron problem in bulk and two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theoryof the trion polaron: a bound state of two electrons and one hole, dressed by longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. Starting from the Frohlich Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction of charged particles with LO phonons in three-dimensional (bulk) and two-dimensional (monolayer) polar crystals, we adopt the intermediate coupling variational approximation of Lee, Low, and Pines, and generalize it for the three-body problem. This yields an effective three-particle Hamiltonian with renormalized electron-electron and electron-hole interactions, similar to those obtained for exciton polaron and bipolaron problems. We compute the binding energies for a family of bulk perovskite materials and several atomic monolayer materials characterized by pronounced polar effects, providing quantitative benchmarks for spectroscopic measurements.</description>

      <title>Compromise-Free Scaling of Qubit Speed and Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across leading qubit platforms, a common trade-off persists: increasing coherence comes at the cost of operational speed, reflecting the notion that protecting a qubit from its noisy surroundings also limits control over it. This speed-coherence dilemma limits qubit performance across various technologies. Here, we demonstrate a hole spin qubit in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire that triples its Rabi frequency while simultaneously quadrupling its Hahn-echo coherence time, boosting the Q-factor by over an order of magnitude. This is enabled by the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction, emerging from heavy-hole-light-hole mixing through strong confinement in two dimensions. Tuning a gate voltage causes this interaction to peak, providing maximum drive speed and a point where the qubit is optimally protected from charge noise, allowing speed and coherence to scale together. Our proof-of-concept shows that careful dot design can overcome a long-standing limitation, offering a new approach towards building high-performance, fault-tolerant qubits.</description>

      <title>Flux-Driven Circular Current in a Non-Hermitian Dimerized Aharonov-Bohm Ring: Impact of Physical Gain and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present theoretical work, we numerically explore magnetic response of a tight-binding dimerized ring subjected to Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and environmental interactions. Specifically, we introduce an imaginary site potential on the odd lattice sites to represent physical gain and loss, while the even lattice sites remain unperturbed. We investigate the induced current resulting from the AB flux in both real and imaginary eigenspaces, aiming to enhance this current significantly by adjusting the gain/loss parameter ($d$). Our analysis focuses on how exceptional points in the real and imaginary eigenenergy spaces contribute to notable increases in current at specific $d$ values, and the emergence of purely real current when the imaginary current vanishes. We discuss how the dual behavior of energy spectrum (real and imaginary), converging to and diverging from zero energy, affects the enhancement of the current. Additionally, we study the interplay between the correlations of dimerized hopping integrals and the gain-loss parameter, which affects the current and highlights key features associated with these physical parameters. Furthermore, we consider how system size impacts our findings. Our study may reveal unconventional characteristics in various loop configurations, potentially paving the way for new research directions.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers featuring sharp excitonic lines and diverse grain structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that using h-BN as a substrate for the growth of transition metal dichalcogenides can significantly reduce excitonic linewidths. However, many other optical parameters still require optimization. In this work, we present a detailed study of the low-temperature photoluminescence efficiency of MBE-grown MoSe$_2$ monolayers on h-BN substrates, comparing them to state-of-the-art exfoliated monolayers encapsulated in h-BN. We demonstrate that a quantitative comparison between samples requires accounting for interference effects and Purcell enhancement or suppression of the emission. By accounting for these effects in both photoluminescence and Raman signals, we show that the overall intrinsic luminescence efficiency is proportional to the sample coverage. Consequently, we find that exciton diffusion and edge effects are negligible in spectroscopy of MBE-grown samples, even for nanometer-sized crystals.</description>

      <title>Onsager Reciprocal Relations for Charge and Spin Transport in Periodically Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A time-periodic driving field can be used to generate and control transport phenomena. Any transport coefficients in the linear-response regime are restricted by the Onsager reciprocal relations, but these relations in periodically driven systems have been poorly understood. In particular, the Onsager reciprocal relation in spin transport of these systems is lacking despite its vital role. Here we establish the Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems. We consider the time-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium steady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager reciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of circularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend on the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general arguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems is detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the anomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all the cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check the dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in discussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study will become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport phenomena in periodically driven systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</description>

      <title>Chiral-split magnons in the S = 1 Shastry-Sutherland model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ferromagnets, magnons have only one chirality; while in common antiferromagnets, bands with opposite chiralities are degenerate across the Brillouin zone. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to observe non-degenerate bands of opposite chiralities in altermagnetic materials. Here we take the S = 1 Shastry-Sutherland model, which shows the collinear N\'eel (I) phase, and investigate the magnon band structure showing alternate chirality-splitting and the resulting transport properties. In magnon bands, we find a notable feature of the chirality-split magnon bands, and the split is opposite along two different directions in the Brillouin zone. We also calculate the spin and thermal conductivities using Kubo formalism. Our calculations show robust spin Seebeck and spin Nernst effects due to the alternating chirality split across the Brillouin zone, without any external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density, giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Exceptional flat bands in bipartite non-Hermitian quantum crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands, in which kinetic energy is quenched and quantum states become macroscopically degenerate, host a rich variety of correlated and topological phases, from unconventional superconductors to fractional Chern insulators. In Hermitian lattices, their formation mechanisms are now well understood, but whether such states persist, and acquire new features in non-Hermitian (NH) quantum crystals, relevant to open and driven systems, has remained an open question. Here we show that the Hermitian principle for flat-band formation in bipartite lattices, based on a sublattice degeneracy mismatch, extends directly to the NH regime: whenever one sublattice hosts a momentum-independent eigenvalue with degeneracy exceeding that of its partner on the other sublattice, flat bands arise regardless of gain, loss, or complex couplings. Strikingly, at exceptional points, dispersive bands coalesce to form \emph{exceptional flat bands} that persist beyond these singularities, exhibiting biorthogonal eigenmodes spanning both sublattices, with energies and lifetimes tunable via sublattice asymmetry and non-reciprocal couplings. This general framework unifies Hermitian and NH flat-band constructions, and reveals dispersionless states with no closed-system analogue. The proposed construction is applicable to synthetic platforms, from classical metamaterials, where flat bands can be directly emulated, to quantum-engineered systems such as photonic crystals and ultracold atom arrays, which should host correlated and topological phases emerging from such exceptional flat bands.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in nanowire-based Andreev molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting systems exhibit non-reciprocal current transport under certain conditions of symmetry breaking, a phenomenon known as the superconducting diode effect. This effect allows for perfect rectification of supercurrent, and has received considerable research interest. We report the observation of the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in nanowire-based Andreev molecules, where the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a Josephson junction (JJ) can be nonlocally broken by coherently coupling to another JJ. The JDE can be controlled using both non-local phase and gate voltages. Notably, the non-local phase can induce a sign reversal of the diode efficiency, a manifestation of regulating the probabilities of double elastic cotunneling and double-crossed Andreev reflection. Additionally, the diode efficiency can be further modulated by local and non-local gate voltages, exhibiting a central-peak feature in the gate-voltage space. Our theoretical calculations of the energy spectrum and the Josephson currents align well with the experimental results. These results demonstrate the non-local regulation of the JDE in Andreev molecules, offering significant implications for the control of multi-JJ devices and the development of advanced superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>

Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers</title>

Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.</description>

      <title>Lateral Exchange Bias for N\'eel-Vector Control in Atomically Thin Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a fascinating platform for the exploration of novel physical phenomena arising from their reduced dimensionality and exceptional material properties. Their single-crystalline nature and ultimate miniaturization position them as leading candidates for next-generation spintronic applications. Antiferromagnetic (AF) vdW magnets are of particular interest, as they combine the advantages of vdW magnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities for ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to locally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter -- the N\'eel-vector -- remains a key limitation. Here, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm in nanomagnetism, which we term lateral exchange bias (LEB), to achieve N\'eel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr. We exploit the single-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer N\'eel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose nonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control, we achieve nonvolatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls (DWs) in AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling atomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views on exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving atomic-scale control of AFic order. Our findings pave the way for the development of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based on vdW magnets.</description>
