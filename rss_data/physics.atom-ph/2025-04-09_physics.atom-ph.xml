      <title>Simultaneous Multiphoton-Multiatom Processes in Atomic Gases under Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom processes in atomic gases exposed to laser fields under specific frequency conditions, where multiple atoms are simultaneously excited through the absorption of one laser photon each. These processes represent natural high-order quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects that occur independently of inter-atomic interactions. A characteristic length scale emerges, governing the physical range over which these phenomena manifest. We propose experiments to demonstrate the fundamental aspects of these collective QED processes.</description>

      <title>Role of mechanical effects on the excitation spectra of microwave-dressed Rydberg states in a cold atomic cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the excitation spectra of cold 87Rb atoms to the 55D_3/2 Rydberg state in the presence of microwave (MW) radiation as a function of MW frequency. The spectra reveal several features around the transition-frequencies between adjacent Rydberg states. We argue that some of these features are indicative of variations in the Rydberg excitation probability while others result from the removal of atoms from the cold cloud as a consequence of a MW induced strong dipole-dipole inter-atomic force. Our claim is supported by experimental observations and theoretical modeling.</description>

      <title>Complete and robust population transfer between the two ground states of a three-state loop quantum system by amplitude composite pulse control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a method for achieving complete, robust, and efficient population transfer between the two ground states in a three-level loop quantum system. The approach utilizes composite pulse sequences by effectively mapping the three-state system onto an equivalent two-level system. This transformation allows the use of broadband composite pulses designed initially for conventional two-state quantum systems. Unlike traditional implementations, the composite pulses in the three-level system are not controlled through phase adjustments; instead, they are realized via the amplitude ratio of the Rabi frequencies.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. III. The bird and batching algorithms and other parallel implementations on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present efficient implementations of atom reconfiguration algorithms for both CPUs and GPUs, along with a batching routine to merge displacement operations for parallel execution. Leveraging graph-theoretic methods, our approach derives improved algorithms that achieve reduced time complexity and faster operational running times. First, we introduce an enhanced version of the redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm, which offers superior operational and runtime performance. We detail its efficient implementation on a GPU using a parallel approach. Next, we present an optimized version of the assignment-reconfiguration-ordering (aro) algorithm, specifically tailored for unweighted grid graphs. Finally, we introduce the bird algorithm to solve reconfiguration problems on grids, achieving performance gains over both red-rec and aro. These algorithms can be used to prepare defect-free configurations of neutral atoms in arrays of optical traps, serve as subroutines in more complex algorithms, or cross-benchmark the operational and runtime performance of new algorithms. They are suitable for realizing quantum circuits incorporating displacement operations and are optimized for real-time operation on increasingly large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-stabilized states in magnetic dipolar quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Realization and Calibration of Continuously Parameterized Two-Qubit Gates on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuously parameterized two-qubit gates are a key feature of state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum processors as they have favorable error scalings and show distinct improvements in circuit performance over more restricted maximally entangling gatesets. In this work, we provide a comprehensive and pedagogical discussion on how to practically implement these continuously parameterized M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT), a low-level trapped-ion processor. To generate the arbitrary entangling angles, $\theta$, we simply scale the amplitude of light used to generate the entanglement. However, doing so requires careful consideration of amplifier saturation as well as the variable light shifts that result. As such, we describe a method to calibrate and cancel the dominant fourth-order effects, followed by a dynamic virtual phase advance during the gate to cancel any residual light shifts, and find a linear scaling between $\theta$ and the residual light shift. Once, we have considered and calibrated these effects, we demonstrate performance improvement with decreasing $\theta$. Finally, we describe nuances of hardware control to transform the XX-type interaction of the arbitrary-angle M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate into a phase-agnostic and crosstalk-mitigating ZZ interaction.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. I. The redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the redistribution-reconfiguration (red-rec) algorithm to prepare large configurations of atoms using arrays of dynamic optical traps. Red-rec exploits simple heuristics and exact subroutines to solve atom reconfiguration problems on grids. It admits a fast and efficient implementation suitable for real-time operation. We numerically quantify its performance using realistic physical parameters and operational constraints, both in the absence and presence of loss. Red-rec enables assembling large configurations of atoms with high mean success probability. Fast preparation times are achieved by harnessing parallel control operations that actuate multiple traps simultaneously. Faster preparation times are achieved by rejecting configurations of atoms containing fewer atoms than a given threshold. However, the number of traps required to prepare a compact-centered configuration of atoms on a grid with a probability of 0.5 scales as the 3/2 power of the number of desired atoms. This finding highlights some of the challenges associated with scaling up configurations of atoms beyond tens of thousands of atoms.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms to solve atom reconfiguration problems. II. The assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmable arrays of optical traps enable the assembly of configurations of single atoms to perform controlled experiments on quantum many-body systems. Finding the sequence of control operations to transform an arbitrary configuration of atoms into a predetermined one requires solving an atom reconfiguration problem quickly and efficiently. A typical approach to solve atom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine which atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols that exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this approach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms or the number of times each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that increase the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this work, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve the performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration problems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total distance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of displaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is displaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a partial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time algorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We numerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and in the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation, and heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks. Our results are useful for assembling large configurations of atoms with high success probability and fast preparation time, as well as for designing and benchmarking novel atom reconfiguration algorithms.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum dynamics of Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities injected into a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, using two broad Feshbach resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. For attractive impurity-bath interactions, the impurity spectrum features a single branch, which away from the resonance corresponds to a well-defined attractive polaron; near the resonance we observe dramatic broadening of this branch, suggesting a breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. For repulsive impurity-bath interactions, the spectrum features two branches: the attractive branch that is dominated by excitations with energy close to that of the Feshbach dimer, but has a many-body character, and the repulsive polaron branch. Our measurements show that the behavior of impurities in weakly interacting baths is remarkably universal, controlled only by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction parameter.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Tunable pairing with local spin-dependent Rydberg molecule potentials in an atomic Fermi superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.</description>
