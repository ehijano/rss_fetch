      <title>On Eswarathasan--Levine and Boyd's conjectures for harmonic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide numerical evidence towards three conjectures on harmonic numbers by Eswarathasan--Levine and Boyd. Let $J_p$ denote the set of integers $n\geq 1$ such that the harmonic number $H_n$ is divisible by a prime $p$. The conjectures state that: $(i)$ $J_p$ is always finite and of the order $O(p^2(\log\log p)^{2+\epsilon})$; $(ii)$ the set of primes for which $J_p$ is minimal (called harmonic primes) has density $e^{-1}$ among all primes; $(iii)$ no harmonic number is divisible by $p^4$. We prove $(i)$ and $(iii)$ for all $p\leq 16843$ with at most one exception, and enumerate harmonic primes up to~$50\cdot 10^5$, finding a proportion close to the expected density. Our work extends previous computations by Boyd by a factor of about $30$ and $50$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Greenberg's conjecture and Iwasawa module of Real biquadratic fields I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to investigate the Greenberg's conjecture for real biquadratic fields. More precisely, we propose the following problem: $$\text{What are real biquadratic number fields } K\text{ such that } rank(A(k_\infty))=rank(A(k_1))? $$ where $A(k_\infty)$ are the $2$-Iwasawa module of $k$ and $A(k_1)$ is the $2$-class group of $k_1$ the first layer of the cyclotomic $\mathbb Z_2$-extension of $k$. Moreover, we give several families of real biquadratic fields $k$ such that $A(k_\infty)$ is trivial or isomorphic to $\mathbb Z/2^{n} \mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z^n \times\mathbb Z/2^{m} \mathbb Z$, where $n$ and $m$ are given positive integers. The reader can find also some results concerning $2$-rank of the class group of certain real triquadratic fields.</description>

      <title>Distribution of $\theta-$powers and their sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine a remark of Steinerberger (2024), proving that for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists integers $1 \leq b_{1}, \ldots, b_{k} \leq n$ such that \[ \left\| \sum_{j=1}^k \sqrt{b_j} - \alpha \right\| = O(n^{-\gamma_k}), \] where $\gamma_{k} \geq (k-1)/4$, $\gamma_2 = 1$, and $\gamma_k = k/2$ for $k = 2^m - 1$. We extend this to higher-order roots.
  Building on the Bambah-Chowla theorem, we study gaps in $\{x^{\theta}+y^{\theta}: x,y\in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}\}$, yielding a modulo one result with $\gamma_2 = 1$ and bounded gaps for $\theta = 3/2$.
  Given $\rho(m) \geq 0$ with $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \rho(m)/m &lt; \infty$, we show that the number of solutions to \[ \left|\sum_{j=1}^{k} a_j^{\theta} - b\right| \leq \frac{\rho\left(\|(a_1, \dots, a_k)\|_{\infty}\right)}{\|(a_1, \dots, a_k)\|_{\infty}^{k}}, \] in the variables $((a_{j})_{j=1}^{k},b) \in \mathbb{N}^{k+1}$ is finite for almost all $\theta&gt;0$. We also identify exceptional values of $\theta$, resolving a question of Dubickas (2024), by proving the existence of a transcendental $\tau$ for which $\|n^{\tau}\| \leq n^v$ has infinitely many solutions for any $v \in \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>The positivity technique and low-lying zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we rediscover and sharpen some of the best known results regarding the distribution of low-lying zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions. This builds upon earlier work of Omar, which relies on the classical positivity technique of explicit formulas. In addition, we generalize some of our results to a larger class of $L$-functions and provide effective conditional estimates for the lowest zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Smyth's conjecture and a non-deterministic Hasse principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a 1986 paper, Smyth proposed a conjecture about which integer-linear relations were possible among Galois-conjugate algebraic numbers. We prove this conjecture. The main tools (as Smyth already anticipated) are combinatorial rather than number-theoretic in nature. For instance, the question can be reinterpreted as a question about the possible eigenvalues of a specified linear combination of permutation matrices. What's more, we reinterpret Smyth's conjecture as a local-to-global principle for a "non-deterministic system of equations" where variables are interpreted as compactly supported K-valued random variables (for K a local or global field) rather than as elements of K.</description>

      <title>Explaining Unforeseen Congruence Relationships Between PEND and POND Partitions via an Atkin--Lehner Involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the past several years, numerous authors have studied POD and PED partitions from a variety of perspectives. These are integer partitions wherein the odd parts must be distinct (in the case of POD partitions) or the even parts must be distinct (in the case of PED partitions).
  More recently, Ballantine and Welch were led to consider POND and PEND partitions, which are integer partitions wherein the odd parts cannot be distinct (in the case of POND partitions) or the even parts cannot be distinct (in the case of PEND partitions). Soon after, the first author proved the following results via elementary $q$-series identities and generating function manipulations, along with mathematical induction: For all $\alpha \geq 1$ and all $n\geq 0,$
  $$\mathrm{pend}\left(3^{2\alpha +1}n+\frac{17\cdot 3^{2\alpha}-1}{8}\right) \equiv 0 \pmod{3}, \textrm{ and}$$ $$\mathrm{pond}\left(3^{2\alpha +1}n+\frac{23\cdot 3^{2\alpha}+1}{8}\right) \equiv 0 \pmod{3},$$ where $\mathrm{pend}(n)$ counts the number of PEND partitions of weight $n$ and $\mathrm{pond}(n)$ counts the number of POND partitions of weight $n$.
  In this work, we revisit these families of congruences, and we show a relationship between them via an Atkin--Lehner involution. From this relationship, we can show that, once one of the above families of congruences is known, the other follows immediately.</description>

      <title>On continued fraction maps associated with a submodule of $\mathfrak o(\sqrt{-3})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a continued fraction map associated with the $\mathfrak o(\sqrt{-3})$-module $\mathcal J = \eta \cdot\mathfrak o(\sqrt{-3})$, $\eta = \frac{3 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}$, which is an Eisenstein field version of the continued fraction map associated with $\mathfrak o(\sqrt{-1}) \cdot (1 + i)$ defined by J.~Hurwitz in the case of the Gaussian field. Together with $T$, we show that all complex numbers $z$ can be expanded as $\mathcal J$-coefficients. We discuss some basic properties of these continued fraction expansions such as the monotonicity of the absolutely value of the principal convergent $q_{n}$ and the existence of the absolutely continuous ergodic invariant probability measure for $T$.</description>

      <title>If a machine did it, it is probably transcendental (even $p$-adically)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continued fraction expansions provide a well-established bridge between algebraic properties of numbers and combinatorics on words. In this article, we investigate the algebraicity of $p$-adic numbers whose continued fractions arise from certain classes of words which generalize the classical automatic, periodic and palindromic words. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions on the $p$-adic continued fraction expansion, such numbers are either algebraic of degree at most 2 or transcendental. This result provides an analogue of results of Bugeaud and Adamczewski-Bugeaud in the real setting and extends previous works that were limited to specific choices of $p$-adic floor functions and less general classes of words.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov exponent attached to modular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To each weakly holomorphic modular function $f\not \equiv 0$ for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, which is non-negative on the geodesic arc $\{e^{it} : \pi/3\leq t\leq 2\pi/3\}$, we attach a $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant map $\Lambda_f:\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})\to \mathbb{R}$ that generalizes the Lyapunov exponent function introduced by Spalding and Veselov. We prove that it takes every value between $0$ and $\Lambda_f\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)$ and it gives an increasing convex function on the Markov irrationalities when ordered using their parametrization by Farey fractions in $[0,1/2]$. In the case of quadratic irrationals $w$ with purely periodic continued fraction expansion, the value $\Lambda_f(w)$ equals the real part of the cycle integral of $f$ along the associated geodesic $C_w$ on the modular surface, normalized with the word length of the associated hyperbolic matrix $A_w$ as a word in the generators $T=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
  1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $V=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$. These results are related to conjectures of Kaneko who observed several similar behavior for the cycle integrals of the modular $j$ function when normalized by the hyperbolic length of the geodesic $C_w$.</description>

Abstract: We give universal bounds on the fraction of nontrivial zeros having given multiplicity for L-functions attached to a cuspidal automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_m/\mathbb{Q}$.

Abstract: We characterise partition regularity for linear equations over the Piatetski-Shapiro numbers $\lfloor n^c \rfloor$ when $1 &lt; c &lt; c^\dag(s)$, where $s \geqslant 3$ is the number of variables. Here $c^\dag(3) = 12/11$ and $c^\dag(4) = 7/6$, while $c^\dag(s) = 2$ for $s \geqslant 5$. We also establish density results with quantitative bounds. Following recent developments, we take this opportunity to update Browning and Prendiville's version of Green's Fourier-analytic transference principle, strengthening its conclusion.</description>

      <title>On commuting pairs in arbitrary sets of 2x2 matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of $2 \times 2$ matrices with real entries. For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any finitely--supported probability measure $\mu$ on $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$, we prove that either \[ T(\mu) = \sum_{X, Y \in {\rm supp}(\mu), XY = YX} \mu(X) \mu(Y) &lt; \varepsilon \] or there exists some finite set ${S}$ contained in a $2$-dimensional subspace of $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\mu({S}) \geq \varepsilon/8$. This is sharp up to the multiplicative constant. We prove quantitatively stronger results when \[ \mu ( (a_{i,j})_{1 \leq i,j \leq 2} ) = \nu(a_{1,1}) \dots \nu(a_{2,2}) \ \ \text{for every} \ a_{1,1}, \dots, a_{2,2} \in \mathbb{R}, \]
  with $\nu$ being some finitely--supported probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$. For instance, when ${A} \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a generalised arithmetic progression or multiplicative progression of dimension $d$ and $\nu = {1}_{{A}}/|{A}|$, our techniques imply that $|{A}|^{-3} \ll_d T(\mu) \ll_d |{A}|^{-3}$. Our methods highlight the connections of this problem to results in incidence geometry, growth in groups phenomenon as well as Bourgain--Chang type sum-product estimates over $\mathbb{R}$. The latter includes applications of Schmidt's subspace theorem and the resolution of the weak polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa conjecture over integers.</description>

      <title>Number of partitions of modular integers (with an Appendix by P. Deligne)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $n,k,s$, we give a formula for the number $T(n,k,s)$ of order $k$ subsets of the ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose sum of elements is $s$ modulo $n$. To do so, we describe explicitly a sequence of matrices $M(k)$, for positive integers $k$, such that the size of $M(k)$ is the number of divisors of $k$, and for two coprime integers $k_{1},k_{2}$, the matrix $M(k_{1}k_{2})$ is the Kronecker product of $M(k_{1})$ and $M(k_{2})$. For $s=0, 1, 2$, and for $s=k/2$ when $k$ is even, the sequences $T(n,k,s)$ are related to the number of necklaces with $k$ black beads and $n-k$ white beads, and to Lyndon words. This work begins with empirical determinations of $M(k)$ up to $k=10000$, from which we infer a closed formula that encompasses many entries in the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Its proof comes from work on Ramanujan sums, by Ramanathan, with a generalization to wider problems linked to representation theory and recently described by Deligne.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Graham about the Sylvester's sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{u_n\}$ be the Sylvester's sequence (sequence A000058 in the OEIS), and let $ a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \cdots $ be any other positive integer sequence satisfying $ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{a_k} = 1 $. In this paper, we solve a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, which asks whether $$ \liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n^{\frac{1}{2^n}} &lt; \lim_{n\to\infty} u_n^{\frac{1}{2^n}} = c_0 = 1.264085\ldots. $$ We prove this conjecture using a constructive approach. Furthermore, assuming that the unproven claim of Erd\H{o}s and Graham that "all rationals have eventually greedy best Egyptian underapproximations" holds, we establish a generalization of this conjecture using a non-constructive approach. [This paper solves Problem 315 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>

      <title>On the Polynomial Szemer\'edi Theorem in Finite Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem implies that, for any $\delta \in (0,1)$, any family $\{P_1,\ldots, P_m\} \subset \mathbb{Z}[y]$ of nonconstant polynomials with constant term zero, and any sufficiently large $N$, every subset of $\{1,\ldots, N\}$ of cardinality at least $\delta N$ contains a nontrivial configuration of the form $\{x,x+P_1(y),\ldots, x+P_m(y)\}$. When the polynomials are assumed independent, one can expect a sharper result to hold over finite fields, special cases of which were proven recently, culminating with arXiv:1802.02200, which deals with the general case of independent polynomials. One goal of this article is to explain these theorems as the result of joint ergodicity in the presence of asymptotic total ergodicity. Guided by this concept, we establish, over general finite commutative rings, a version of the polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem for independent polynomials $\{P_1,\ldots, P_m\} \subset \mathbb{Z}[y_1,\ldots, y_n]$, deriving new combinatorial consequences, such as the following. Let $\mathcal R$ be a collection of finite commutative rings subject to a mild condition on their torsion. There exists $\gamma \in (0,1)$ such that, for every $R \in \mathcal R$, every subset $A \subset R$ of cardinality at least $|R|^{1-\gamma}$ contains a nontrivial configuration $\{x,x+P_1(y),\ldots, x+P_m(y)\}$ for some $(x,y) \in R \times R^n$, and, moreover, for any subsets $A_0,\ldots, A_m \subset R$ such that $|A_0|\cdots |A_m| \geq |R|^{(m+1)(1-\gamma)}$, there is a nontrivial configuration $(x, x+P_1(y), \ldots, x+P_m(y)) \in A_0\times \cdots \times A_m$. The fact that general rings have zero divisors is the source of many obstacles, which we overcome; for example, by studying character sums, we develop a bound on the number of roots of an integer polynomial over a general finite commutative ring, a result which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Ceresa Cycles of $X_{0}(N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ceresa cycle is an algebraic 1-cycle on the Jacobian of an algebraic curve. Although it is homologically trivial, Ceresa famously proved that for a very general complex curve of genus at least 3, it is non-trivial in the Chow group. In this paper we study the Ceresa cycle attached to the complete modular curve $X_{0}(N)$ modulo rational equivalence. For prime level $p$ we give a complete description, namely we prove that if $X_{0}(p)$ is not hyperelliptic, then its Ceresa cycle is non-torsion. For general level $N$, we prove that there are finitely many $X_{0}(N)$ with torsion Ceresa cycle. Our method relies on the relationship between the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle and Chow-Heegner points on the Jacobian. We use the geometry and arithmetic of modular Jacobians to prove that such points are of infinite order and therefore deduce non-vanishing of the Ceresa cycle.</description>

      <title>On the analog of the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition representation for continuous functions of several $p$-adic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that any continuous function depending on several $p$-adic variables, each of which is defined on $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one $p$-adic variable. This statement is true for both functions with values in $\mathbb{R}$ and functions with values in $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.</description>

      <title>On Log-Concave Operator Acting on Sequences and Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of sequences and series under the action of the log-concave operator \(\mathcal{L}\). We explore the relationship between the convergence of a sequence \((a_k)\) and the convergence of sequences and series derived by applying \(\mathcal{L}\) iteratively. These results demonstrate the strong regularity properties of log-concave sequences and provide a framework for analyzing the convergence of sequences and series derived from the log-concave operator. The findings have implications for combinatorics, probability, optimization, and related fields, opening new avenues for further research on the behavior of log-concave sequences and their associated operators.</description>
