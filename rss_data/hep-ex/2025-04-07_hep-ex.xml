      <title>The DArk Messenger Searches at an Accelerator Experiment, A Case of a Table-Top Scale Experiment at a Beam Dump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DAMSA (DArk Messenger Searches at an Accelerator) experiment is a table-top scale, extremely-short-baseline experiment designed to probe dark-sector particles (DSPs) that serve as portals between the visible sector and the hidden dark-matter sector. These particles, such as axion-like particles (ALPs), can decay into two photons or electron-positron pairs. DAMSA is specifically optimized to explore regions of parameter space that are inaccessible to past and current experiments, by operating at ultra-short baselines and employing high-resolution calorimetry, precision timing, and precision tracking in a magnetic field with suppression of beam-related neutron backgrounds. The experiment can be integrated into facilities, such as CERN's Beam-Dump-Facility (BDF), operating concurrently with the SHiP experiment, and provides complementary sensitivity in the MeV to GeV mass range. DAMSA represents a cost-effective and timely opportunity to expand CERN's discovery potential in dark-sector physics. It exemplifies how innovative, small-scale experiments can effectively complement large-scale experiments, taking advantage of existing and future infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Combined effective field theory interpretation of Higgs boson, electroweak vector boson, top quark, and multi-jet measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraints on the Wilson coefficients (WCs) corresponding to dimension-six operators of the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) are determined from a simultaneous fit to seven sets of CMS measurements probing Higgs boson, electroweak vector boson, top quark, and multi-jet production. The measurements of the electroweak precision observables at LEP and SLC are also included and provide complementary constraints to those from CMS. The CMS measurements, using 36-138 fb$^{-1}$ of LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, are chosen to provide sensitivity to a broad set of operators, for which consistent SMEFT predictions can be derived. These are primarily measurements of differential cross sections or, in the case of Higgs boson production, simplified template cross sections, which are subsequently parametrized in the WCs. Measurements targeting $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{X}$ production model the SMEFT effects directly in the reconstructed observables. Individual constraints on 64 WCs, and constraints on 42 linear combinations of WCs, are obtained. In the case of the linear combinations, the 42 parameters are varied simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the upgraded 3-inch Hamamatsu photomultiplier for the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3-inch Hamamatsu R14374-02 photomultiplier tube is an improved version of the R12199-02 model and its successor in the construction of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope. A total of 1000 photomultipliers were analysed to assess their dark count rate, transit time spread, and spurious pulses. A subset of 200 photomultipliers were further evaluated to determine their quantum efficiency which is an essential parameter for Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response. The measurements show that R14374-02 model has better quantum efficiency homogeneity over the photocatode and better time properties than the R12199-02.</description>

      <title>Technology developments for LHCb Upgrade II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major LHCb detector upgrade will be installed during long shutdown~4 (LS4) of the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The experiment will operate at a maximum luminosity of up to $1.5\times 10^{34}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with acceptance covering a pseudorapidity range close to the beamline. The detector will therefore experience extremely high particle fluences. In order to carry out the LHCb physics programme, technologies are being developed that can withstand the high rates and associated radiation damage while also providing excellent resolution in both space and time. The amount of data to be processed in the online computing and trigger system is also unprecedented. In this document, the technology developments that are necessary to realise this programme are summarised.</description>

      <title>2026 ESPPU input from the ANUBIS Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is imperative for us as a particle physics community to fully exploit the physics potential of the High-Luminosity LHC. This calls for us not to leave any stone unturned in the search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. Many BSM models that address fundamental questions of physics like the particulate nature of dark matter, the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, small but non-zero neutrino masses etc, predict Long-Lived Particles (LLPs) with macroscopic lifetimes of $\tau&gt;10^{-10}$ s. The challenge in searching for BSM models with LLP signatures at the HL-LHC is that it requires the complementary interplay of general purpose detectors like ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb; dedicated detectors situated close to the beamline including the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF); and dedicated detectors covering a large decay volume at a reasonable solid angle transverse to the beamline, i.e., a Transverse Physics Facility (TPF). Hence, it is of vital importance to realise a TPF in order to expand dramatically the physics coverage within long-lived particle searches to harvest the physics at the HL-LHC fully. A TPF may be composed of several experiments based at the HL-LHC. In this document, we propose that the community realise the ANUBIS experiment as part of a TPF.</description>

      <title>Energy-energy correlators in charm-tagged jets in proton-proton collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s} = 13}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the first measurement of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) in charm-tagged jets from proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. EECs probe the structure of QCD radiation, providing a unique test of mass-dependent effects in parton showers involving a charm quark and offering a distinct view into non-perturbative phenomena, including the hadronization process. The EEC is measured for charm-tagged jets and flavor-untagged (inclusive) jets with transverse momenta of $10 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 30$ GeV/$c$, where charm-quark mass effects are significant. We observe a significant suppression of the EEC amplitude in charm jets compared to inclusive ones, consistent with the expected suppression of radiation from massive quarks -- a fundamental prediction of QCD. Despite the significant amplitude difference, the observed peak positions of the charm and inclusive-jet EEC are similar, indicating a complex interplay between Casimir factor (differentiating quark and gluon jets), and quark-mass (dead-cone) effects in the QCD parton shower as well as subsequent hadronization effects. Comparisons with next-to-leading order calculations and various Monte Carlo event generators reveal the sensitivity of this observable to both mass effects in the parton shower and hadronization process. These results provide new constraints on theoretical models of heavy-quark jets and offer insights into the parton-to-hadron transition in QCD.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Tensor hybrid charmonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass and current coupling of the tensor hybrid charmonia $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=2^{-+}$ and $2^{++}$, as well as their full widths are calculated in the context of QCD sum rule method. The spectral parameters of these states are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule approach including dimension-12 terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2} $. The full width of these hybrid states are evaluated by considering their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the hybrid state $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ decays to $ D^{(\pm )}D^{\ast (\mp )}$, $D^{0}\overline{D}^{\ast 0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\pm )}D_{s}^{\ast (\mp )} $ mesons are taken into account. The processes $ \widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast) 0} \overline{D}^{(\ast) 0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast) -} $ are employed to estimate the full width of the hybrid charmonium $\widetilde{H}_{ \mathrm{c}}$. The partial widths of these decays are computed by means of QCD three-point sum rule approach which is necessary to calculate strong couplings at the relevant hybrid-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions $ m=(4.16\pm 0.14)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\widetilde{m}=(4.5\pm 0.1)~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the masses and $\Gamma \left[ H_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(160\pm 23)~\mathrm{ MeV}$, $\Gamma \left[ \widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(206\pm 25)~\mathrm{ MeV}$ for the full width of these hybrid charmonia can be useful to study and interpret various resonances in the $4-5~\mathrm{GeV}$ mass range.</description>

      <title>Input to European Strategy Update for Particle Physics: Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human activity continues to have an enormous negative impact on the ability of the planet to sustain human and other forms of life. Six out of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed, a seventh is close to threshold. Prominent manifestations of this development are climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, as well as loss of biodiversity. In recognition of the urgency of these problems, several international agreements have been ratified to achieve net-zero emissions and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Significant reductions in emissions are required by 2030 to meet international climate targets. The field of particle physics has an obligation and an opportunity to contribute to such mitigation efforts and to avoid causing further harm. This document urges the European Strategy Update in Particle Physics to set a clear and bold mandate for embedding environmental sustainability throughout the future scientific programme, and advocates for a series of actions that will enable this.</description>

      <title>Expected performance of the ALPIDE pixel layers in ALICE FoCal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE experiment is designed to study ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As part of its major upgrades for Run 4, the Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) will be installed during Long Shutdown 3 (LS3). FoCal enables precise measurements of direct photon production at forward rapidity, providing a sensitive probe of the gluon distribution in protons and nuclei.
  This paper introduces the expected performance of the forward electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E) and presents several potential strategies for mitigating occupancy and BUSY violation challenges in the pixel layers of FoCal-E. Beam test results demonstrate that back biasing effectively reduces pixel occupancy. Meanwhile, SystemC simulations explore additional mitigation strategies-such as grid masking and a regional trigger-to further minimize BUSY violations and enhance detector performance under high-luminosity conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.
  The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern neural network architectures demands fast and memory-efficient implementations to mitigate computational bottlenecks. In this work, we evaluate the recently proposed BitNet architecture in HEP applications, assessing its performance in classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks. Specifically, we investigate its suitability for quark-gluon discrimination, SMEFT parameter estimation, and detector simulation, comparing its efficiency and accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that while BitNet consistently performs competitively in classification tasks, its performance in regression and generation varies with the size and type of the network, highlighting key limitations and potential areas for improvement.</description>

      <title>Support for Gravitationally-Attractive Composite Antimatter and Gravitationally-Repulsive Non-composite Antimatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALPHA collaboration recently published the article "Observation of the effects of gravity on the motion of antimatter" in issue 621 of Nature (2023), in which their conclusion states that "The probability that our data are consistent with repulsive gravity is so small as to be quantitatively meaningless (less than $10^{-15}$). Consequently, we can rule out the existence of repulsive gravity of magnitude 1$g$ between the Earth and antimatter." Indeed, their experiment proved that antihydrogen falls toward the Earth. Antihydrogen, however, is a composite particle and its mass, like that of the proton, is dominated by the mass of its binding energy. In this paper, we point out that their experiment only measures the gravitational effect on composite antimatter, and not free or valence antimatter particles such as antiquarks or antileptons. Here, we review the various theoretical frameworks supporting the possibility that valence antiquarks experience a repulsion of the order $g$ by the Earth's gravitational field. We show that the ALPHA collaboration's recent result may actually be consistent with a repulsive gravitational component of about 15%. Next, we review our concept for a direct interaction experiment between antiquarks and the Earth's gravitational field, which should be capable of providing irrefutable evidence of the gravitational repulsion of non-composite antiparticles. Finally, we suggest that existing data, collected by AMS-01 of daughter particles from cosmic protons interacting with the Mir space station, may help demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed experiment.</description>

      <title>One Way of Parameter-based Calculation and Comparison of Sensitivities in $0\nu\beta\beta$ Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Worldwide efforts are underway to detect neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay using experiments based on various technologies and target isotopes. Future experiments in this regard aim to exclude the inverted order (IO) condition or explore the normal order (NO) band. Consequently, comparing the sensitivities of proposed $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments with promising prospects is essential. The current study adopts sensitivity metrics, including exclusion and discovery sensitivities, half-life sensitivities, and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of 9 typical promising experiments: LEGEND, CDEX, nEXO, XLZD, PandaX, KamLAND-Zen, JUNO, SNO+, and CUPID, and highlight their unique features. Based on reported experimental parameters, the concept of a ``technical line'' is introduced to determine the location that each experiment may realize in the $\xi$ and $\lambda_{b}$ space, where $\xi$ represents the sensitive exposure per year, and $\lambda_{b}$ denotes the expected annual rate of background events. Half-life sensitivities for the selected experiments are calculated, some of them in multiple phases while others in conservative or aggressive condition. The results indicate that increasing the operation time is more beneficial for zero-background experiments, which also demonstrate greater competitiveness in discovery sensitivity. $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are presented as uncertainty bands arising from the nuclear matrix element uncertainties. Additionally, half-life and $m_{\beta\beta}$ sensitivities are estimated under ideal conditions, where only irreducible $2\nu\beta\beta$ background remains. The upper limits of background reduction achievable with current experimental setups are also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter boosted by supernova shock within the effective field theory framework from the CDEX-10 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova shocks can boost dark matter (DM) particles to high, yet nonrelativistic, velocities, providing a suitable mechanism for analysis within the framework of the nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT). These accelerated DM sources extend the experimental ability to scan the parameter space of light DM into the sub-GeV region. In this study, we specifically analyze DM accelerated by the Monogem Ring supernova remnant, whose age ($\sim 68000$ yr) and distance to Earth ($\sim 300$ parsecs) are strategically matched to enable detection with current terrestrial detectors. Utilizing the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), we derive new constraints on boosted DM within the NREFT framework. The NREFT coupling constant exclusion regions now penetrate the sub-GeV mass range, with optimal sensitivity achieved for operators $\mathcal{O}_{3}$, $\mathcal{O}_{6}$, $\mathcal{O}_{15}$ in the 0.4--0.6 GeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Search for fractionally charged particles in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is presented for fractionally charged particles with charge below 1$e$, using their small energy loss in the tracking detector as a key variable to observe a signal. The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions collected at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2016-2018 at the CERN LHC. This is the first search at the LHC for new particles with charges between $e/$3 and 0.9$e$, including an extension of previous results at a charge of 2$e/$3. Masses up to 640 GeV and charges as low as $e/$3 are excluded at 95% confidence level. These are the most stringent limits to date for the considered Drell-Yan-like production mode.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal fluctuations and number of muons at the ground in muon-depleted proton air showers at PeV energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon counting is an effective strategy for discriminating between gamma and hadron-initiated air showers. However, their detection, which requires shielded detectors, is highly expensive and challenging to implement across large, environmentally sensitive areas.
  This work allowed to establish for the first time that at PeV energies the gamma/hadron discriminator based on the new $LCm$ variable have proton rejection levels of the order of $10^{-4}$, outperforming the discrimination power based on the counting of the number of muons.
  A thorough examination of muon depleted showers at the PeV energies and the simulation strategy devised to achieve the required $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ simulated showers is presented.</description>

      <title>Detectable MeV Neutrino Signals from Neutron-Star Common-Envelope Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common-envelope evolution - where a star is engulfed by a companion - is a critical but poorly understood step in, e.g., the formation pathways for gravitational-wave sources. However, it has been extremely challenging to identify observable signatures of such systems. We show that for systems involving a neutron star, the hypothesized super-Eddington accretion onto the neutron star produces MeV-range, months-long neutrino signals within reach of present and planned detectors. While there are substantial uncertainties on the rate of such events (0.01-1/century in the Milky Way) and the neutrino luminosity (which may be less than the accretion power), this signal can only be found if dedicated new analyses are developed. If detected, the neutrino signal would probe super-Eddington accretion, leading to significant new insights into the astrophysics of common-envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar and vector tetraquarks $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06759v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar and vector four-quark states $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ are studied in the context of the QCD sum rule method. We model $T_{\mathrm{ \ \ PS}} $ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ as structures built of diquarks $ b^{T}C\gamma_{5}b$, $\overline{c}C\overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{5}b$ , $\overline{c}C\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\overline{c}^{T}$, respectively, with $ C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$, i.e., their masses and current couplings are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. We evaluate the full widths of $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ by taking into account their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the pseudoscalar particle they are processes $T_{\mathrm{PS}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{3}P_{0})$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. The vector state $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ can dissociate to meson pairs $2 B_{c}^{-}$, $2 B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices, which evaluated in the context of the three-point sum rule approach. Predictions obtained for the mass and full width of the pseudoscalar $m =(13.092\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma _{\mathrm{PS} }=(63.7\pm 13.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and vector $\widetilde{m} =(13.15\pm 0.10)~ \mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{V}}=(53.5\pm 10.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$ tetraquarks can be useful for analyses of different four-quark resonances.</description>

      <title>Global parametrizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering with dispersive constraints: Beyond the S0 wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new global parametrizations of $\pi\pi \to \pi\pi$ scattering for the S2, P, D, F, and G partial waves up to at least 1.8 GeV, easy to implement for phenomenological use. With earlier S0-wave parametrizations, slightly updated here, they reproduce previous partial wave dispersion analyses up to the $\pi\omega$ threshold. In addition, these new parametrizations have improved their description of recent P-wave data, the inelasticity in various waves, and their fulfillment of Roy-like and forward dispersion relations. The latter now test very high partial waves and have an improved matching with the Regge regime, extending those with P-wave contributions up to 1.6 GeV. Above 1.6 GeV and up to 1.8 GeV, or sometimes somewhat beyond, the parametrizations are simple unconstrained fits to data.</description>

      <title>Learning Broken Symmetries with Approximate Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing symmetries in data allows for significant boosts in neural network training, which is especially important where training data are limited. In many cases, however, the exact underlying symmetry is present only in an idealized dataset, and is broken in actual data, due to asymmetries in the detector, or varying response resolution as a function of particle momentum. Standard approaches, such as data augmentation or equivariant networks fail to represent the nature of the full, broken symmetry, effectively overconstraining the response of the neural network. We propose a learning model which balances the generality and asymptotic performance of unconstrained networks with the rapid learning of constrained networks. This is achieved through a dual-subnet structure, where one network is constrained by the symmetry and the other is not, along with a learned symmetry factor. In a simplified toy example that demonstrates violation of Lorentz invariance, our model learns as rapidly as symmetry-constrained networks but escapes its performance limitations.</description>

      <title>Trilepton and tetralepton bound and resonant states: the QED counterpart of multiquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first prediction of tetralepton resonant states containing muons, extending beyond the simplest tetralepton system, dipositronium ($\mathrm{Ps}_2$). With the rapid advancements in experimental facilities, the production and study of these intriguing states may be within reach. We perform a comprehensive analysis of S-wave trilepton and tetralepton systems within the framework of a QED Coulomb potential. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the three- or four-body Schr\"odinger equation and utilize the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We uncover a series of bound and resonant states in the trilepton systems $e^+e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-$, $e^+e^+\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-$, as well as the tetralepton systems $e^+e^+e^-e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-e^-$. The energies of these states range from $-30$ eV to $-1$ eV below the total mass of three or four leptons, with their widths varying from less than $0.01$ eV to approximately $0.07$ eV. Additionally, we calculate the spin configurations and root mean square radii of these states, providing insight into their spatial structures. No bound or resonant states are found in the trilepton $e^+\mu^+e^-$, $\mu^+e^+\mu^-$ systems, nor in the tetralepton $\mu^+e^+\mu^-e^-$ system. A comparison with fully heavy tetraquark systems reveals that the additional color degree of freedom in QCD results in the absence of low-energy bound and resonant states. However, this extra degree of freedom allows for a broader range of $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers to produce resonant states, highlighting the rich complexity of QCD systems.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of true muonium observation in Belle-II existing dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the cleanest bound states, being composed only of leptons, along with true tauonium and positronium. Unlike the latter, true muonium and true tauonium have not been observed so far. This article shows that the spin-0 state of true muonium (para-TM), decaying into two photons, can be observed at a discovery level of significance in the dataset already collected by the Belle-II experiment at the $\Upsilon (4S)$ peak, with certain assumptions on systematic uncertainties. Para-TM is produced via photon-photon fusion, and its observation is based on the detection of the photon pair resulting from its decay, on top of the continuum background due predominantly to light-by-light scattering. Trigger, acceptance and isolation cuts, along with calorimeter resolution and reconstruction efficiency, are taken into account during the Monte Carlo simulation of both signal and background. In order to separate signal and background, a machine learning method, based on extremely randomized trees, is trained on simulated events. Finally, the expected statistical significance of TM observation is evaluated, taking into account systematic uncertainties in a parametric fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ITkPixV2 chip is the final production readout chip for the ATLAS Phase 2 Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade at the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Due to the extraordinarily high peak luminosity at the HL-LHC of $5 \times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, ITkPixV2 must meet significant increases in nearly all design requirements, including a 10x increase in trigger rate, a 7.5x increase in hit rate, a 3x increase in radiation tolerance, and a 12.5x decrease in pixel current draw per unit area, all while maintaining a similar power per unit area as present pixel detectors. Here we present the first measurements of the ITkPixV2 chip operated at the limits of the full chip design requirements, including in particular a measurement of the activity-induced current of the chip as a function of increasing hit rate.</description>

      <title>Beautiful Majorana Higgses at Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel collider signature within the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model, featuring a Higgs sector composed of a bi-doublet and two triplets. Our study focuses on a region of the parameter space where the $SU(2)_R$ charged gauge boson $W_R$ lies in the multi-TeV regime (3-100 TeV) and the additional Higgs states play a significant role. In this scenario, a heavy neutral Higgs boson $\Delta$ with a dominant $SU(2)_R$ triplet component can be produced in association with either a Standard Model Higgs boson or a massive weak boson. The subsequent decay of the heavy Higgs into Majorana neutrinos $N$ results in displaced lepton signatures, providing a striking manifestation of lepton number violation. Additionally, we explore how the production of $b$-jets in these processes can enhance hadron-collider sensitivity to such signals. A particularly compelling channel, $pp \to b \bar b NN$, offers the exciting possibility of simultaneously probing the spontaneous mass origin of both Dirac fermions and Majorana states. Based on an optimised event selection strategy and state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations, we outline the expected reach at the HL-LHC and future colliders. Our findings demonstrate that this channel probes a region of parameter space where the neutral Higgs triplet and heavy neutrino masses are relatively light ($m_\Delta \lesssim 250$ GeV, $m_N \lesssim 80$ GeV), indirectly constraining the $W_R$ boson to the deep multi-TeV domain, with sensitivity extending up to 70-80 TeV, effectively turning the LHC into a precision machine.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>
