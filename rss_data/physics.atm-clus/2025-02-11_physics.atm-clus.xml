      <title>New opportunities for high pressure hydrogen achieved by fullerane vibrating modes: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The encapsulation of hydrogen within fullerene/fullerane cages offers a promising avenue for studying high pressure hydrogen dynamics. Through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the behavior of a system consisting of hydrogen atoms enclosed in a \ch{C20H20} dodecahedrane. Our findings reveal significant structural and dynamical changes as the cage undergoes compression, corresponding to radial symmetric vibration. We analyze geometric, energetic, and thermodynamic parameters, highlighting correlations and observing behavior analogous to high pressure phases of hydrogen. Notably, our study bridges the gap between theory and experiment by proposing a novel approach to achieving high pressures and temperatures experimentally. These results not only contribute to the understanding of hydrogen behavior under extreme conditions but also hold implications for the quest to attain metallic hydrogen - a milestone in materials science with potential applications in various fields.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold triatomic molecules by electric microwave association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical model is proposed for the formation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules in weakly bound energy levels. The process is driven by the electric component of a microwave field, which induces the association of an ultracold atom colliding with an ultracold diatomic molecule. This model is exemplified using $^{39}$K atoms and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules, both in their ground states, a scenario of experimental relevance. The model assumes that the dynamics of the association are dominated by the long-range van der Waals interaction between $^{39}$K and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K. The electric microwave association mechanism relies on the intrinsic electric dipole moment of $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K, which drives transitions between its lowest rotational levels ( $j$=0 and $j$=1). The energies of the uppermost triatomic energy levels are computed by numerically solving coupled Schr\"odinger equations using the Mapped Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method. Measurable association rates are derived within the framework of a perturbative approach. This method of electric microwave association provides an alternative to atom-molecule association via magnetic Feshbach resonances for forming ultracold, deeply bound triatomic molecules, and is applicable to a wide range of polar diatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>
