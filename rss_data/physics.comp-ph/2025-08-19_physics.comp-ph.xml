      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization in the Estimation of PDE and Delay-PDE models from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an improved method for estimating partial differential equations and delay partial differential equations from data, using Bayesian optimization and the Bayesian information criterion to automatically find suitable hyperparameters for the method itself or for the equations (such as a time-delay). We show that combining time integration into an established model estimation method increases robustness and yields predictive models. Allowing hyperparameters to be optimized as part of the model estimation results in a wider modelling scope. We demonstrate the method's performance on a number of synthetic benchmark problems of different complexity, representing different classes of physical behaviour. This includes the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard models, as well as different reaction-diffusion systems without and with time-delay.</description>

      <title>Rapid Variable Resolution Particle Initialization for Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of meshless methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is highly dependent on the quality of the particle distribution. Existing particle initialization techniques often struggle to simultaneously achieve adaptive resolution, handle intricate boundaries, and efficiently generate well-packed distributions inside and outside a boundary. This work presents a fast and robust particle initialization method that achieves these goals using standard SPH building blocks. Our approach enables simultaneous initialization of fluid and solid regions, supports arbitrary geometries, and achieves high-quality, quasi-uniform particle arrangements without complex procedures like surface bonding. Extensive results in both 2D and 3D demonstrate that the obtained particle distributions exhibit good boundary conformity, low spatial disorder, and minimal density variation, all with significantly reduced computational cost compared to existing approaches. This work paves the way for automated particle initialization to accurately model flow in and around bodies with meshless methods, particularly with SPH.</description>

      <title>Time Reversible Integration of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for time-reversible numerical integration of the deterministic Landau-Lifshitz Gilbert equation by means of a second order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is presented and tested against commonly used second order predictor-corrector methods. We find the time-reversibility of the Suzuki-Trotter integrator to be superior by several orders of magnitude while the computational effort is similar. Calculations of trajectories backwards in time are useful, for example, when evaluating dynamical corrections to transition state theory.</description>

      <title>Collective ballistic motion explains fast aggregation in adhesive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by motile cells during tissue formation, we identify a mechanism by which active systems of self-aligning adhesive particles undergo ballistic aggregation via a flocking transition. This kinetic regime emerges when the cluster persistence length grows faster with cluster mass than the intercluster distance does. We also characterize and explain the emergence of distinct non-collective kinetic regimes, including long-lived transients relevant to biological systems. Our results provide a unified framework consistent with the broad range of aggregation exponents experimentally observed in cellular systems and uncover physical principles which may enable timely tissue organization</description>

      <title>Reduced-order modeling of Hamiltonian dynamics based on symplectic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM) framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks (HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Load-Balanced Diffusion Monte Carlo Method with Lattice Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\sim$98\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.</description>

      <title>Conditional mutual information: A generalization of causal inference in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; nonetheless, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be explored rigorously. This paper introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to grasp the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Turbulence with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory use by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics like Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover possible new physics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</description>

      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. III Beam loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent semi-analytical theory of beam loading in inhomogeneous accelerating structures based on the generalized theory of coupled modes is proposed. A single-mode approximation was used when the fields are represented as a sum of two components, one of which is associated with the right travelling eigen wave, and the second with the left. However, this second component is not always a left travelling. When a field is excited by an electron beam it can have complex spatial distribution. The results of calculation of the distribution of electric fields excited by a relativistic electron beam are presented.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Neutrino Scattering: Domain Adaptation with GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Simulations of Catalytic Metal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short: density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling wind farm noise emission and propagation: effects of flow layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates how wind farm flow physics influence noise generation and downstream propagation through numerical simulations. The flow field is modeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves as input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first turbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN) contribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher frequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN mostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more pronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than in staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall because turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow significantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition modifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an isolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound focusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to higher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm compared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based on isolated turbines. These findings underscore the importance of integrating flow and acoustic models to more accurately assess the environmental impact of wind farms.</description>

      <title>LAMBench: A Benchmark for Large Atomistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Atomistic Models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomistic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to August 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research. The LAMBench code is open-sourced at https://github.com/deepmodeling/lambench, and an interactive leaderboard is available at https://www.aissquare.com/openlam?tab=Benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with mean relative $L_2$ errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure $p$ and velocity components $u_x, u_y$, confirming its reliability. To further enhance physical consistency, we incorporate explicit physics-informed losses based on RANS residuals, including mass and momentum conservation constraints. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, enabling efficient aerodynamic simulations. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous and isotropic elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification).</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Multi-Agent LLMs with Interpretable Physics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly important role in physics research by assisting with symbolic manipulation, numerical computation, and scientific reasoning. However, ensuring the reliability, transparency, and interpretability of their outputs remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent LLM physicist framework that fosters collaboration between AI and human scientists through three key modules: a reasoning module, an interpretation module, and an AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands logical rigor, quantitative accuracy, and alignment with established theoretical models, we propose an interpretation module that employs a team of specialized LLM agents-including summarizers, model builders, visualization tools, and testers-to systematically structure LLM outputs into transparent, physically grounded science models. A case study demonstrates that our approach significantly improves interpretability, enables systematic validation, and enhances human-AI collaboration in physics problem-solving and discovery. Our work bridges free-form LLM reasoning with interpretable, executable models for scientific analysis, enabling more transparent and verifiable AI-augmented research.</description>

      <title>Extracting the singularity of a logarithmic partition function to investigate quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of a partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations in practice, since resolving the singularity of a logarithmic partition function requires extremely high-precision data,especially when distinguishing weakly first-order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite-size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the analytic terms. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many-body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first-order phase transitions, such as in JQ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many-body phase transitions.</description>
