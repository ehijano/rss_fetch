      <title>Cyclo-Graphyne: A Highly Porous and Semimetallic 2D Carbon Allotrope with Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of Cyclo-graphyne (CGY), an emerging 2D carbon allotrope with a porous structure of sp/sp$^2$-hybridized carbon atoms. Using density functional theory, we systematically investigate its structural, energetic, dynamical, thermal, electronic, mechanical, optical, and vibrational properties. The calculated cohesive and formation energies are both comparable to those of other synthesized graphynes, confirming its energetic viability. Phonon dispersion calculations confirm its dynamical stability, while ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate thermal stability up to at least 1000 K. Electronic results reveal that CGY is a semimetal with an ultranarrow band gap and features two Dirac cones in its electronic structure. Mechanically, CGY is highly compliant and isotropic, exhibiting a Young's modulus an order of magnitude lower than that of graphene. The optical spectrum reveals strong ultraviolet absorption and infrared reflectivity with an isotropic response, while the vibrational spectra show distinct Raman peaks and rich infrared activity. These properties position CGY as a promising candidate for future applications in areas such as gas capture and separation, flexible nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>All-magnonic neurons for analog artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog neuromorphic hardware is gaining traction as conventional digital systems struggle to keep pace with the growing energy and scalability demands of modern neural networks. Here, we present analog, fully magnonic, artificial neurons, which exploit a nonlinear magnon excitation mechanism based on the nonlinear magnonic frequency shift. This yields a sharp trigger response and tunable fading memory, as well as synaptic connections to other neurons via propagating magnons. Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy on a Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet thin film, we show multi-neuron triggering, cascadability, and multi-input integration across interconnected neurons. Finally, we implement the experimentally verified neuron activation function in a neural network simulation, yielding high classification accuracy on standard benchmarks. The results establish all-magnonic neurons as promising devices for scalable, low-power, wave-based neuromorphic computing, highlighting their potential as building blocks for future physical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal magnetization pathways in photoexcited semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabilization of long-range magnetic order in nominally non-magnetic semi- conductors using femtosecond light pulses is an exciting yet experimentally challenging goal. Theoretical studies indicate that certain non-magnetic semi- conductors can exhibit transient magnetic instabilities following above-gap laser excitation, but the dynamical pathways leading to these states remain largely unexplored. In this work, I introduce a minimal real-time spin-orbital model and identify the fundamental microscopic mechanisms that enable the emergence of a transient magnetic order. I then discuss the relevance of these findings for real materials employing a phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg- Landau model. Finally, I analyze the strengths and limitations of current first-principles methodologies for investigating dynamically induced broken- symmetry states in the light of the present results.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the reactivity of isolated LixSi domains in Si anodes using operando NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Si anodes can greatly improve the energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, understanding and mitigation of calendar aging remains a barrier to commercialization. In this short report, we utilize operando Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect and quantify lithium silicides (LixSi) as they form and react within Si anodes in pouch cells during calendar aging. We provide direct experimental evidence of complex aging phenomena in the Si anodes, including both SEI growth and dissolution during storage. Formation of electrochemically isolated LixSi is also observed, as indicated by the partial persistence of highly lithiated phases after the cell is discharged. Remarkably, we show that these isolated domains can themselves self-discharge over time, suggesting that their detection can be challenging in post-mortem studies. Finally, we show that aging outcomes depend heavily on the type of silicon particles contained within the electrode, and that certain surface coatings can help decrease the reactivity between lithium silicides and the electrolyte.</description>

      <title>Er$_\mathrm{Al}$:Al$_2$O$_3$ for Telecom-Band Photonics: Electronic Structure and Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Er-doped Al$_2$O$_3$ is a promising host for telecom-band integrated photonics. Here we combine ab initio calculations with a symmetry-resolved analysis to elucidate substitutional Er on the Al site (Er$_\mathrm{Al}$) in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$. First-principles relaxations confirm the structural stability of Er$_\mathrm{Al}$. We then use the local trigonal crystal-field symmetry to classify the Er-derived impurity levels by irreducible representations and to derive polarization-resolved electric-dipole selection rules, explicitly identifying the symmetry-allowed $f$\textendash$d$ hybridization channels. Kubo--Greenwood absorption spectra computed from Kohn--Sham states quantitatively corroborate these symmetry predictions. Furthermore, we connect the calculated intra-$4f$ line strengths to Judd--Ofelt theory, clarifying the role of $4f$\textendash$5d$ admixture in enabling optical activity. Notably, we predict a characteristic absorption near $1.47~\mu\mathrm{m}$ (telecom band), relevant for on-chip amplification and emission. To our knowledge, a symmetry-resolved first-principles treatment of Er:Al$_2$O$_3$ with an explicit Judd--Ofelt interpretation has not been reported, providing a transferable framework for tailoring rare-earth dopants in wide-band-gap oxides for integrated photonics. Our results for the optical spectra are in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Zero-field Anomalous Hall Effect in Bulk Single Crystal Mn3Ir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L1_2-phase non-collinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn_3Ir has emerged as a pioneering platform for realizing the zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE), thereby catalyzing rapid advances in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Despite its significant potential, experimental investigations of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of Mn_3Ir have been greatly hindered by the formidable challenges in growing bulk single crystals. Here, we report the growth of stoichiometric Mn_3Ir bulk single crystals and their characterization in terms of magnetization and the AHE. Using a high-throughput flux method, we obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of RCd3P3 (R: Ce or La) compounds: Insulator-metal transition induced by displacement of atoms in the unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the electronic structures and optical properties of single crystals of RCd3P3 (R = Ce or La). Our first-principles analysis indicates that CeCd3P3 and LaCd3P3 exhibit semiconductor characteristics with narrow energy gaps of approximately 0.51 and 0.70 eV, respectively. Notably, a slight displacement of the Cd and P atoms within the unit cell significantly transforms the electronic structure from insulating to metallic state. Optical spectroscopy of both compounds reveals a metallic state with a low charge carrier density, suggesting a finite density of states at the Fermi level. A comparison between the theoretical electronic structures and experimental optical properties elucidates the observed metallic behavior. Additionally, the notable modification of the infrared-active phonons strongly indicates a structural phase transition in these compounds. Our findings also suggest that CeCd3P3 serves as a suitable platform for investigating the photoinduced Kondo effect due to its metallic ground state with limited charge carriers.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of popular dielectric substrate materials in a wide spectral range from far-infrared to ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the optical properties of 13 different dielectric materials (slide glass, quartz, Al2O3 (c-cut), DyScO3 (110), KTaO3 (001), LaAlO3 (001), (LaAlO3)0.3-(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 (001) (LSAT), MgF2 (100), MgO (100), SiC, SrTiO3 (001), TbScO3 (110), and TiO2). The single-bounce reflectance spectra of the bulk samples were measured using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and monochromatic spectrometers across a wide spectral range, from far infrared to ultraviolet (80-50,000 cm-1). Using the Kramers-Kronig analysis, we obtained the optical conductivity and dielectric function of the dielectric materials from their measured reflectance spectra. Moreover, we measured the transmittance spectra of the materials to obtain their bandgaps. We fitted the measured reflectance spectra using the Lorentz model to obtain phononic structures. Each dielectric material exhibits unique phononic structures and optical bandgaps, associated with the composition and crystal structure of the material. The observed optical properties of these dielectric materials provide valuable information for the optical analysis of thin films grown on them.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous and Topological Hall Effect and Nernst Effect in a Dirac Kagome Magnet Fe3Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for kagome magnets with unconventional magnetic and electronic properties has gained significant attention in recent years. We report the magnetic, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of Fe3Ge single crystals, where the Fe atoms form a slightly distorted kagome lattice. Fe3Ge exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect and anomalous Nernst effect. The anomalous transverse thermoelectric conductivity reaches about 4.6 A m^-1 K^-1, exceeding values reported for conventional ferromagnets and most topological ferromagnets. First-principles calculations indicate that these transport responses are primarily governed by intrinsic mechanisms, highlighting the dominant role of Berry curvature arising from massive Dirac gaps in momentum space. In addition, we observe a topological Hall resistivity of about 0.9 microOhm cm and a topological Nernst coefficient of 1.2 microvolt K^-1, which are attributed to the Berry phase associated with field-induced scalar spin chirality. These findings demonstrate the combined influence of Berry phases in both momentum and real space, establishing Fe3Ge as a promising candidate for room-temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>A closed-loop AI framework for hypothesis-driven and interpretable materials design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific hypothesis generation is central to materials discovery, yet current approaches often emphasize either conceptual (idea-to-data) reasoning or data-driven (data-to-idea) analysis, rarely achieving an effective integration of both. Here, we present a generalizable active learning workflow that integrates top-down, theory-driven hypothesis generation, guided by a large language model. This is complemented by bottom-up, data-driven hypothesis testing through a root-cause association study. We demonstrate this approach through the design of equimolar quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite, a chemically complex system with over 850,000 possible cation combinations. In the top-down component, the large language model drives closed-loop optimization by proposing candidates that are likely to achieve phase purity, leveraging domain knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning. With each iteration, the model identifies an increasing number of near phase-pure compositions, sampling less than 0.004% of the design space. In parallel, the bottom-up association study identifies molecular features with statistically significant influences on phase purity. The integration of these approaches enables the convergence of conceptual and statistical hypotheses, leading to generalizable and rational design rules for phase-pure quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskites. As a proof of concept, we applied the optimized phase-pure quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite film as a surface capping layer in perovskite solar cells, achieving good performance and stability. Our framework enables the development of interpretable and generalizable design rules that are applicable to a wide range of optimization processes within complex design spaces, providing a foundational strategy for rational, scalable, and efficient materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Octahedral dynamics and local symmetry in hybrid perovskite FAPbI3 under thermal excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been employed to investigate the evolution of local motifs within the tetragonal phase of FAPbI3 under thermal excitation. Our results reveal a distinct broadening in the distribution of PbI6 octahedral volumes with increasing temperature, indicating a gradual breakdown of symmetry and emergence of diverse local environments. These octahedral volume distortions are primarily driven by the dynamic behaviour of the FA cation leading to softening of PbI6 octahedra, evident from calculated mean octahedral volume and Pb-I-Pb bond angles. The examination of electronic structure confirmed that this dynamic structural phenomenon is directly responsible for the change in fundamental band gap value, highlighting the role of PbI6 octahedra in modifying and modulating the electronic properties in FAPbI3. The results demonstrate the microscopic origin of thermally induced dynamical behaviour to the macroscopic electronic properties and underscore the pivotal role of local motifs in hybrid perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium-doped semiconductor crystals CdZnTeSe with several different compositions of raw materials were grown via the vertical Bridgman method under high-pressure argon. For the first time, these crystals were obtained via a combined method from a mixture of simple and binary starting components. A theoretical analysis of the permissible reactions for obtaining multicomponent CdZnTeSe crystals from different compositions of starting materials was performed. The homogeneity of the distribution of the atomic composition and electrical resistance (in the dark and under illumination) of the obtained crystals was studied. Crystals grown via the new combined method presented the best homogeneity of composition and electrophysical properties.</description>

      <title>Beyond Bloch: A Theoretical Blueprint for Conjugated Polymer Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugated polymers are experiencing a surge of renewed interest due to their promising applications in various organic electronic devices. These include organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, among many others. Their appeal stems from distinct advantages they hold over traditional inorganic semiconductors. Unlike inorganic semiconductors, where electrons are often considered to be in delocalized, free, or quasi-free states (as described by Bloch's theory), electrons in conjugated polymers behave differently. They are strongly coupled within highly localized $\sigma$ or $\pi$-orbitals and interact significantly with the ionic cores. This means they are far from the idealized delocalized states presumed by Bloch's theory approaches. Consequently, after nearly a century of applying Bloch's theory to the electronic transport properties of inorganic materials, there is a clear need for a new theoretical framework to explain efficient charge transport in these organic solids. Our presented model addresses this need by incorporating crucial electron-electron interactions. Specifically, it accounts for both intra-site interactions and interactions between the $\pi$-states located at alternating sites along the polymer chain. This framework provides a many-body charge conduction mechanism and explains the semiconducting properties of the undoped material. A significant outcome of our model is the prediction of two novel flat bands of excited bonding states. Intriguingly, these states obey Bose--Einstein statistics and facilitate charge transport. Furthermore, our model accurately reproduces experimental data, providing an excellent fit for measured UV-Vis absorption and electroluminescent spectra.</description>

      <title>A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional diagnostics of Weyl points -- Berry flux on small spheres and $k \cdot p$ linearization -- are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center and radius, gauge smoothing, charting, and local frame transport) that introduce algorithmic arbitrariness in first-principles workflows. We propose a \emph{local, basis-free} criterion built from the octonionic structure on $\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we construct a unit octonion field and its octonionic connection; contracting three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$--invariant three-form yields a pseudoscalar density whose sign equals the Weyl chirality. A vanishing octonionic associator at leading order certifies that the local problem closes inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane, while a nonzero density identifies a Weyl point. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge-seam choices. In the linear regime we prove equivalence with the conventional diagnostics (Chern charge on a small sphere and $\mathrm{sgn}\det v$). We outline a practical algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and provide self-consistency checks based on stencil refinement and the associator norm.

      <title>Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride as two-dimensional strain sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice deformation is a powerful way to engineer the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, making their precise measurement an important challenge for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) enable quantitative strain sensing with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. Using this approach, we precisely quantify the strain-induced shift of the E$_{\rm 2g}$ Raman mode in a hBN flake under uniaxial stress, establishing V$_\text{B}^-$ centers as a new tool for strain metrology in van der Waals heterostructures. Beyond strain sensing, our work also highlights the unique multimodal sensing functionalities offered by V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which will be valuable for future studies of strain-engineered 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical Defect Sink Behaviour of HCP/BCC Zr/Nb Multilayer Interfaces: Bubble-Denuded Zones at Nb Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation induced helium bubble formation poses a major challenge to the structural integrity of materials in nuclear energy systems. In this study, we investigate defect evolution and He behavior in ZrNb nanoscale metallic multilayers with immiscible BCC and HCP interfaces, irradiated with 80 keV He ions. For comparison, single crystal Nb and polycrystalline Zr were also irradiated under identical conditions to serve as reference materials. Using cross sectional TEM, SIMS, STEM EELS, nanoindentation, Doppler Broadening Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy, Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy, and atomistic simulations, we reveal a highly asymmetric damage response across the multilayer interfaces. Zr layers exhibit larger He bubbles, higher swelling, and greater helium retention while Nb layers develop bubble-denuded zones exclusively around the interfaces, where bubble nucleation is strongly suppressed and swelling is limited. This asymmetry arises from differences in atomic transport properties DFT calculations show lower migration barriers for vacancies and He atoms in Nb, enabling efficient defect migration and recombination at interfaces, whereas Zr retains defects due to higher migration barriers. EELS and DBS PALS measurements confirm bubble densities and the presence of sub-nanometer open volumes. Compared to monolithic samples, the ZrNb multilayers exhibit lower irradiation induced hardening and reduced He retention. These findings highlight the role of interfaces in driving asymmetric radiation damage and demonstrate the effectiveness of BCC Nb layers in mitigating defect growth. Overall, ZrNb multilayers are established as a superior alternative to conventional single and polycrystalline materials for extreme irradiation environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-to-classical transition and H-theorem in surface diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, surface diffusion is studied with a different perspective by showing how the corresponding open dynamics is transformed when passing, in a continuous and smooth way, from a pure quantum regime to a full classical regime; the so-called quantum-to-classical transition. This continuous process is carried out from the Liouville-von Neumann equation by scaling Planck's constant. For this goal, the Brownian motion of an adsorbate on a flat surface is analyzed in order to show how this transition takes place. In particular, this open dynamics is studied from the master equation for the reduced density matrix within the Caldeira-Leggett formalism; in particular, the two extreme time behaviors, the ballistic and diffusive motions. It is also shown that the origin of the ballistic motion is different for the quantum and classical regimes. In this scenario, the corresponding Gaussian function for the intermediate scattering function is governed by the thermal velocity in the classical regime versus the initial spreading velocity of the wave packet for the quantum regime, leading to speak of classical and quantum ideal gas, respectively. Finally, in the diffusive regime, and starting from the Chudley-Elliott model, the quantum-to-classical transition is also discussed in terms of the well-known H-function for three surface temperatures in the diffusion of H and D on a Pt(111) surface. The main goal in this analysis is if one can discriminate the irreversibility coming from tunneling and thermal activation diffusion.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond heat-based logic, writing and reset in an antiferromagnetic magnetoresistive memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.</description>

      <title>Giant optical anisotropy in CrSBr from giant exciton oscillator strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between dimensionality and electronic correlations in van der Waals (vdW) materials offers a powerful toolkit for engineering light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are central to this endeavor, yet maximizing their oscillator strength, which dictates the interaction cross-section, remains a challenge. Conventional wisdom suggests a trade-off, where the observable oscillator strength often decreases in strongly bound systems due to population dynamics. Here, we unveil a colossal oscillator strength associated with the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) excitons in the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr, which fundamentally defies this established scaling law. Through comprehensive optical characterization and ab initio calculations, we establish that this anomalous enhancement originates directly from the reduced dimensionality, which enforces an increased electron-hole wavefunction overlap. Moreover, we find a close connection between fundamental exciton and local spin fluctuations that contribute to the opening of the gap in the electronic spectrum. The resulting optical anisotropy shows a giant in-plane birefringence (Delta_n = 1.45) and profoundly anisotropic waveguiding, which we directly visualize using nano-optical imaging. Leveraging this extreme response, we realize a true zero-order quarter-wave plate with an unprecedented wavelength-to-thickness ratio (lambda/t) exceeding 3.4, surpassing the limits of current miniaturization technologies, including state-of-the-art metasurfaces. Our findings underscore the profound impact of dimensionality engineering in magnetic vdW materials for realizing novel regimes of light-matter coupling and developing next-generation ultracompact photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Chemistry and physics of layered oxychalcogenides containing an anti-cuprate type square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in layered solid-state materials containing an [M2O] square lattice layer (M = transition metal), particularly because [M2O] is the anti-type of the [CuO2] planes in the layered cuprate superconductors. In addition to the superconducting titanium oxypnictides, the [M2O] anti-cuprate layer also occurs in a wide range of layered oxychalcogenide compounds with M spanning early (Ti, V) to later transition metals (Mn, Co, Fe). The chalcogenide in question - which sandwiches the anti-cuprate layer - may be S, Se or Te, and in combination with a wide range of intervening "spacer" layers, many different structural families have been investigated. This review surveys the structures and physical properties of all these oxychalcogenide materials and relates these properties to their common anti-cuprate square lattice [M2O] layer. It is organised around the different oxidation states of the metal ion M, in order to explore the effects of the electronic configuration of M on the physical properties of each compound as a whole. A key part of the review highlights the use of soft-chemical modifications to alter physical properties of these materials, in the synthesis of novel van der Waals materials and other metastable compounds. Future avenues for these materials in the bulk, few- and single-layer limits are discussed.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Strain Evolution and Grain Boundary-Mediated Defect Sink Behavior in Irradiated SiC: Insights from N-PED and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding irradiation-induced strain in silicon carbide (SiC) is essential for designing radiation-tolerant ceramic materials. However, conventional methods often fail to resolve nanoscale strain gradients, especially in polycrystalline forms. In this study, we employ nano-beam precession electron diffraction (N-PED) to perform high-resolution, multi-directional strain mapping in both single-crystal 4H-SiC and polycrystalline {\alpha}-SiC subjected to helium and hydrogen ion irradiation. The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) simulations of He + H irradiated single-crystal 4H-SiC closely match the strain profiles obtained from N-PED, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of the N-PED method. In He-irradiated polycrystalline {\alpha}-SiC at high temperatures, a bubble-depleted zone (BDZ) near the grain boundary (GB) reveals that GBs act as active sinks for irradiation-induced defects. N-PED further shows strain amplification localized at the GBs, reaching up to 2.5%, along with strain relief within the BDZ. To explain this behavior, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of binding and migration energies indicate a strong tendency for Si, C, and He atoms to segregate toward the GB core. This segregation reduces the availability of vacancies to accommodate He atoms and leads to local strain relaxation near the GB. Furthermore, first-principles tensile simulations reveal that Si and C interstitials mitigate He-induced GB embrittlement. Charge density and DOS analyses link this effect to the bonding characteristics between point defects and neighboring atoms at GB. These insights underscore the importance of grain boundary engineering in enhancing radiation tolerance of SiC for nuclear and space applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ordering in Moir\'e Graphene Multilayers from a Continuum Hartree+U Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, symmetry-broken ground states, such as correlated insulating states, magnetic order and superconductivity, have been discovered in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) near the so-called magic-angle. Understanding the magnetic order in these systems is challenging, as atomistic methods become extremely expensive near the magic angle and continuum approaches fail to capture important atomistic details. In this work, we develop a self-consistent approach based on a continuum model that incorporates both short-ranged Hubbard interactions and long-ranged Coulomb interactions, therefore allowing efficient exploration of magnetic order in moir\'e graphene multilayers. With this approach, we perform a systematic analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of tBLG as a function of doping level and twist angle, near the magic angle. We find that the results are consistent with previous perturbative atomistic Hartree+U calculations. Furthermore, we predict stable magnetic orders for the tTLG. We found that the magnetic orders are similar to those in tBLG for small values of on-site repulsion. In the future, the developed method can be utilized to investigate magnetic ordering tendencies from short-range exchange interactions in other moir\'e graphene multilayers as a function of doping, twist angle, screening environment, among other variables.</description>

      <title>A Methodological Study on Data Representation for Machine Learning Modelling of Thermal Conductivity of Rare-Earth Oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling is widely employed in materials sci- ence to predict properties of interest and extract useful descriptors for measured properties. In thermal barrier coatings (TBC), QSAR can significantly shorten the experimental discovery cycle, which can take years. Although machine learning methods are commonly employed for QSAR, their performance depends on the data quality and how instances are represented. Traditional, hand-crafted descriptors based on known material properties are limited to represent materials that share the same basic crystal structure, limited the size of the dataset. By contrast, graph neural networks offer a more expressive representation, encoding atomic positions and bonds in the crystal lattice. In this study, we compare Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian Process (GP) models trained on hand-crafted descriptors from the literature with graph-based representations for high-entropy, rare-earth pyrochlore oxides using the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN). Two different types of augmentation methods are also explored to account for the limited data size, one of which is only applicable to graph-based representations. Our findings show that the CGCNN model substantially outperforms the RF and GP models, underscoring the potential of graph-based representations for enhanced QSAR modelling in TBC research.</description>

      <title>Anharmonicity-driven phonon avoided crossing and anomalous thermal transport in nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding thermal and electrical transport in topological materials is essential for advancing their applications in quantum technologies and energy conversion. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate phonon and charge transport in the prototypical nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. The results unveil that anharmonic phonon renormalization results in the pronounced softening of heat-carrying phonons and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). Crucially, anharmonic effects are found to noticeably weaken Zr-S interactions, triggering avoided-crossing behavior of low-frequency optical phonons. The combination of phonon softening and avoided crossing synergistically reduces phonon group velocities, yielding a 16\% suppression in $\kappa_{\rm L}$ along the $c$-axis at room temperature. Contrary to conventional metals, we discover that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity in ZrSiS is abnormally large, even dominating heat conduction along the $c$-axis. This unusual behavior results in a substantial deviation of the Lorenz number from the Sommerfeld value -- exceeding it by up to threefold -- thereby challenging the validation of standard Wiedemann-Franz law for thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate that ZrSiS exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, attributed to its topological electronic Dirac states that accounts for both high Fermi velocities and weak electron-phonon coupling. This study provides critical insights into the electrical and thermal transport mechanisms in ZrSiS and highlights the importance of anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics and thermal transport of metallic materials.</description>

      <title>Trends in the electronic structure of borophene polymorphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borophene is a two-dimensional material made out of boron atoms only. It exhibits polymorphism and different allotropes can be studied in terms of a rigid electronic structure, where only the occupation of the states change with the respect to the number of electrons available in the system (self-doping). In this work we selected a set of representative borophene polymorphs ($\delta_3$, $\delta_5$, $\delta_6$, $\beta_{12}$ $\alpha_1$, $\alpha'$, $\alpha'$-Bilayer) and studied the shared features of their electronic structures and the limitations of this model. Our work revealed the appearance of defect-like states in some polymorphs when related to a parent rigid electronic structure, and bonding/antibonding monolayer-like states in the $\alpha'$-Bilayer. Moreover, we show how the buckling of $\delta_6$ and $\alpha'$ can act as a tuning parameter, enabling semimetallicity, Dirac cones, and nesting of the Fermi surface. In light of their promises for exotic but also useful behavior, we expect our work to foster the interest in larger and more complex borophene structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogen vacancies in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as WS$_{2}$, play a crucial role in various applications ranging from optoelectronics and catalysis to quantum information science (QIS), making their identification and control essential. This study focuses on WS$_{2}$ single vacancy and vacancy pairs. Using first principles computations, we investigate their thermodynamic stabilities and electronic structures. We identify an "on-top" divacancy configuration where two vacancies sit on top of each other to be the only energetically stable complex with a binding energy of 160 meV. We compute a small difference in electronic structure with a shift of the unoccupied state by 140 meV for the divacancy complex and observe electronic state shift during Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy of a series of vacancy in WS$_2$ providing spectroscopical evidence for the presence of this defect.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cation Selection and Disorder within Entropy-Driven $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ ($A$=Zr/Hf, $B$=Nb/Ta) Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local atomic and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and defect chemistry of $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ ($A$ = Zr/Hf, $B$ = Nb/Ta) oxides using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We examine both ordered unit cells as well as fully disordered special quasirandom structures to clearly discern the effects of cation disorder. Structural predictions align closely with previous experimental results and follow established ionic radii trends. The electronic structure is strongly dependent on $B$-cation species: $A_{6}$Ta$_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions have ~30% larger band gaps than their $A_{6}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{17}$ counterparts. Defect chemistry is similar for all compositions, with anion vacancies being more energetically favorable than corresponding cation defects. All explored $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions are enthalpically unstable with respect to their $A$O$_{2}$ and $B_{2}$O$_{5}$ competing oxides and are therefore classified as entropy-stabilized materials, supporting prior experimental results. The pronounced agreement between our disordered supercell predictions with experimental measurements indicates all explored $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions contain substantial cation disorder across all 6-, 7-, and 8-coordinated sites. Our findings collectively provide a fundamental understanding of the $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ material family through DFT calculations, establishing a framework for future compositional tuning to engineer targeted material properties.</description>

      <title>Optical probing of charge traps in organic field-effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report spatially resolved optical probing of charge traps in organic field-effect transistors using focussed laser illumination. By scanning a 635 nm laser across the transistor channel and simultaneously acquiring transfer characteristics, we observe persistent, localised shifts in transistor turn-on voltage correlated with illumination dose and position, with negligible impact on field-effect mobility. The effect is strongest 5-10 um from the source electrode and requires a drain-to-source scan direction with sub-10 um step size. Kelvin probe force microscopy confirms trapped negative charges along the scan path, consistent with exciton dissociation and electron trapping near the semiconductor-dielectric interface. The phenomenon is reproducible across multiple device geometries and organic semiconductors, including TMTES-pentacene, TIPS-pentacene, and diF-TES-ADT. These findings enable direct mapping of trap distributions and suggest new strategies for trap engineering, threshold voltage tuning, and development of organic optoelectronic memories.</description>

      <title>Detachment limited interlayer transport processes during SrTiO3 pulsed laser epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed laser epitaxial growth is characterized by high instantaneous deposition rates that leads to the nucleation of transient islands, both on surface terraces, and on top of stable islands formed during previous deposition pulses. We report results from combined in-situ X-ray reflectivity and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Specular reflectivity monitors interlayer transport, while diffuse scattering reveals the evolution of in-plane length scales, both during the recovery time between individual laser pulses and over multiple deposited layers. The initial stage after each laser pulse is faster than the temporal resolution of the experiment, while subsequent recovery occurs over seconds. The results suggest that transient islands on top of stable two-dimensional islands form immediately after the deposition pulse, and then ripen via detachment and diffusion, leading to the slower component. kMC simulations show that the detachment energy barrier plays a dominant role in determining the recovery time constant.</description>

      <title>First principles band structure of interacting phosphorus and boron/aluminum $\delta$-doped layers in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon can be heavily doped with phosphorus in a single atomic layer (a $\delta$ layer), significantly altering the electronic structure of the conduction bands within the material. Recent progress has also made it possible to further dope silicon with acceptor-based $\delta$ layers using either boron or aluminum, making it feasible to create devices with interacting $\delta$ layers with opposite polarity. It is not known, however, how these $\delta$ layers will interact, particularly at small separation distances. Using Density Functional Theory, we calculate the electronic structure of a phosphorus-based $\delta$ layer interacting with a boron or aluminum $\delta$ layer, varying the distances between the $\delta$ layers. At separations 10 \AA\ and smaller, the dopant potentials overlap and largely cancel each other out, leading to an electronic structure closely mimicking bulk silicon. At separations greater than 10 \AA, the two layers behave independently of one another, forming a p-n diode with an intrinsic layer taking the place of the depletion region. One mechanism for charge transfer between $\delta$ layers at larger distances could be tunneling, where we see a greater than 3\% probability for tunneling between a phosphorus and boron layer at 20 \AA\ separation. This tunneling rate exceeds what would be seen for a standard silicon 1.1 eV triangular barrier, indicating that the interaction between delta layers creates enhanced tunneling at larger separation distances compared to a traditional junction. These calculations provide a foundation for the design of silicon-based electronics based on interacting $\delta$ layers.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of oxidation and chlorine corrosion in Ni-based superalloys: The role of boron and light interstitial segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the interaction of light interstitials in multi-element Ni-based alloys. We show that light interstitials such as boron and oxygen fundamentally alter interfacial chemistry by reshaping alloy-element distribution and segregation. Oxygen adsorption drove boron migration from the grain boundary to the free surface, where it co-enriched with Cr, Fe, and Mo and formed BO3 trigonal motifs embedded within mixed-metal oxide networks. Oxygen also promoted M-O-M chain formation, including Nb2O5 clusters at the free surface. In the absence of oxygen, boron segregated to the grain boundary, altering local metal chemistry and underscoring a dynamic, environment-sensitive behavior. Following chlorine exposure, the oxidized surfaces retained strong O-mediated connectivity while forming new Cl-M associations, particularly with Nb and Cr, and exhibited further surface enrichment in Cr, Fe, and Mo. High-temperature MD simulations revealed a dynamic tug-of-war: chlorine exerted upward pull and disrupted weakly anchored sites, while Nb- and BO3-rich oxide motifs resisted deformation. A new stabilization mechanism was identified in which subsurface boron atoms anchored overlying Cr centers, suppressing their mobility and mitigating chlorine-driven displacement. These results demonstrate boron's dual role as a modifier of alloy-element segregation and a stabilizer of oxide networks, and identify Nb as a key element in reinforcing cohesion under halogen attack. More broadly, this study highlights the need to track light interstitial cross-talk and solute migration under reactive conditions, offering atomistic criteria for designing corrosion-resistant surface chemistries in Ni-based superalloys exposed to halogenated or oxidative environments.</description>

      <title>Molecular Insights into Caprock Integrity of Subsurface Hydrogen Storage: Perspective on Hydrogen-induced Swelling and Mechanical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geological storage of hydrogen (H_2) requires reliable long-term caprock sealing, yet the nanoscale interactions between H_2 and clay minerals remain critically underexplored despite their importance for storage security. This lack of understanding has limited the ability to predict mechanical stability and leakage risks in H_2 storage formations. Using molecular simulations, this study investigates the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of sodium montmorillonite (Mt), a common smectite clay, under varying hydration states and interlayer H_2 contents. Results show that H_2 accelerates hydration-state transitions, narrows the stability window of crystalline swelling, and promotes asymmetric plume formation in confined interlayers. H_2 alters cation and water coordination, thereby weakening Na^+--Mt electrostatic interactions and modulating H-bond networks at the interface and in the bulk. Mechanical analysis reveals pronounced anisotropy in Mt. In-plane stiffness is mainly governed by basal spacing expansion, whereas out-of-plane stiffness is highly sensitive to the initial presence of water or H_2, which weaken interlayer cohesion. Tensile and compressive strengths in the in-plane directions follow in-plane stiffness trends, while the out-of-plane tensile strength is governed by Mt--water H-bonds. The presence of H_2 further promotes Mt sheets separation by disrupting nanoscale liquid bridges. Collectively, these results provide the first atomistic-scale evidence that intercalated H_2 reshapes swelling energetics, elastic anisotropy, and failure pathways in Mt, highlighting critical nanoscale mechanisms that may compromise caprock integrity during underground H_2 storage.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings in weak localization of spin-orbit coupled graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak localization theory is developed for graphene heterostructures with transition metal dichalcogenides and topological insulators where the Rashba and valey-Zeeman spin-splittings of the energy spectrum are large enough. The anomalous magnetoresistance in low fields caused by weak localization is calculated. It is shown that the valley-Zeeman splitting has no effect on weak localization in the absence of Rashba splitting but it results in the change of the magnetoconductivity sign in the Rashba-coupled graphene. Inter-valley scattering also affects the quantum correction to the conductivity resulting in its sign reversal. Analytical expressions are obtained for the anomalous magnetoconductivity at arbitrary relations between the Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings as well as the inter-valley scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Generation of pure, spin polarized, and unpolarized charge currents at the few cycle limit of circularly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In certain members of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) family, laser pulses of oppositely circularly polarized light excite electrons of opposite spin. Here we show that in the few cycle limit such pulses generate not only a spin density excitation, but also a spin current excitation. Employing the example of the TMDC WSe$_2$ we show that pure spin currents, the flow of spin in the absence of net charge flow, 100% spin polarized currents, and charge currents are all accessible and controllable by tuning the amplitude of ~ 5 femtosecond gap tuned light pulses. Underpinning this physics is a symmetry lowering of the valley charge excitation from C3 at long duration to C2 in the few cycle limit, imbuing the excitation with net current. Our results both highlight the emergence of a rich light-spin current coupling at ultrafast times in the TMDC family, as well presenting a route to the all-optical generation of pure spin currents.</description>

      <title>Influence of La-doping on the magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-gapped system SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aliovalent doping of the two-dimensional dimer antiferromagnet SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has long been proposed as a potential route toward realizing resonating valence bond (RVB) superconductivity in this system; however, experimental progress has remained limited. This study explores the effects of La doping on the ground state of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ and reports the first flux growth of Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$Cu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals with nominal doping levels up to $x$ = 0.15. Powder X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the successful incorporation of La on the Sr sites within the tetragonal $I\bar{4}2m$ structure, although the effective doping was limited to approximately 50% of the nominal concentration. La doping induces systematic changes in the magnetic properties, with a reduction of the effective spin gap $\Delta$ from ~28.2K to ~20.3 K at $x$ = 0.15, as determined from low-temperature magnetic susceptibility. X-band electron spin resonance measurements reveal the emergence of unpaired Cu$^{2+}$ spins in La-doped SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals, which develop antiferromagnetic correlations below ~5.5 K. These findings corroborate the breaking of the local spin dimers induced by La doping. Despite this, no superconductivity is observed across the entire doping range studied. The present study demonstrates that at low doping levels, electron doping locally destabilizes the spin-singlet ground state in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, while the intrinsic spin dynamics of the dimer lattice remain largely preserved.</description>

      <title>Interaction Topological Transformer for Multiscale Learning in Porous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels, including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization. ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Triggered Superfluorescent Scintillation in Quantum-Ordered Perovskite Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluorescence, a cooperative emission phenomenon arising from the coherent coupling of excited dipoles, has historically been observed under optical excitation in carefully engineered quantum systems. Here, we report the first observation of superfluorescence triggered by ionizing radiation in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystal (NC) superlattices. Using CsPbBr3 NC superlattices with long-range structural and electronic order, we demonstrate that secondary electrons generated by high-energy photons can induce efficient cooperative emission bursts characteristic of superfluorescence with unprecedented scintillation lifetime of ~40 ps, thereby introducing a new class of coherent scintillating metamaterials. Side-by-side optical and scintillation measurements reveal a direct analogy between ionizing and intense optical excitation, both leading to high excitonic densities that result in superfluorescent emission, even at mild, technologically accessible cryogenic temperatures. The discovery that incoherent, stochastic ionization cascades can seed coherent many-body optical responses with radiatively accelerated luminescence and large Stokes shifts establishes a pathway toward ultrafast, reabsorption-free, quantum-ordered nanotechnological scintillators, paving the way for the future development of radiation detectors based on quantum technologies for advanced radiation detection applications.</description>

      <title>Sodium-Decorated Ennea-Graphene: A Novel 2D Carbon Allotrope for High-Capacity Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of safe, efficient, and reversible hydrogen storage materials is critical for advancing hydrogen-based energy technologies and achieving carbon-neutral goals. Ennea-Graphene, a new 2D carbon allotrope made of 4-, 5-, 6-, and mainly 9-membered carbon rings (nonagons), is introduced via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that the monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable at 300 K, as no imaginary modes are detected. The pristine system further exhibits metallic-like electronic behavior. The material exhibits high in-plane stiffness (Young modulus of 255 N/m). Sodium adsorption at the centers of the nonagonal rings is energetically favorable, with a binding energy of approximately -1.56 eV, leading to the formation of the Na@Ennea-Graphene complex. The calculated H2 adsorption energies range from -0.15 eV to -0.18 eV. The Na-decorated structure demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage performance, reversibly adsorbing up to four H2 molecules per Na atom (8.8 wt\% H2). This capacity surpasses the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 target for onboard hydrogen storage materials. The adsorbed H2 remains molecular (H-H bond of 0.76~\AA) and can be released under near-ambient conditions, as verified by 300 K ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings position sodium-decorated Ennea-Graphene as a promising nanomaterial for next-generation hydrogen storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Layer controlled orbital selective Mott transition in monolayer nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality and electronic correlations are crucial elements of many quantum material properties. An example is the change of the electronic structure accompanied by the loss of quasiparticles when a metal is reduced from three dimensions to a lower dimension, where the Coulomb interaction between carriers becomes poorly screened. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we report an orbital-selective decoherence of spectral density in the perovskite nickelate LaNiO3 towards the monolayer limit. The spectral weight of the dz2 band vanishes much faster than that of the dx2-y2 band as the thickness of the LaNiO3 layer is decreased to a single unit cell, indicating a stronger correlation effect for the former upon dimensional confinement. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations show an orbital-selective Mott transition largely due to the localization of dz2 electrons along the c axis in the monolayer limit. This orbital-selective correlation effect underpins many macroscopic properties of nickelates, such as metal-to-insulator transition and superconductivity, where most theories are built upon a dx2-y2-dz2 two-band model.</description>

A key limitation of traditional deep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is critical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science, where often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different strategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we introduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational inference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to machine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the performance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815 TiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a subset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the development of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Modeling metamaterials by second-order rate-type constitutive relations between only the macroscopic stress and strain</title>

Abstract: We propose a thermodynamically based approach for constructing effective rate-type constitutive relations describing finite deformations of metamaterials. The effective constitutive relations are formulated as \emph{second-order} in time rate-type Eulerian constitutive relations between only the Cauchy stress tensor, the Hencky strain tensor and objective time derivatives thereof. In particular, there is no need to introduce additional quantities or concepts such as ``micro-level deformation'',``micromorphic continua'', ``enriched continua'', or elastic solids with frequency dependent material properties. The linearisation of the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) constitutive relations leads, in Fourier space, to the same constitutive relations as those commonly used in theories based on the concepts of frequency dependent density and/or stiffness. From this perspective the proposed constitutive relations reproduce the behaviour predicted by the frequency dependent density and/or stiffness models, but yet they work with constant -- that is motion independent -- material properties. Finally, we argue that the proposed fully nonlinear (finite deformations) second-order in time rate-type constitutive relations do not fall into traditional classes of models for elastic solids (hyperelastic solids/Green elastic solids, first-order in time hypoelastic solids), and that the proposed constitutive relations embody a \emph{new} class of constitutive relations characterising elastic solids.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling Mediated by Fr\"ohlich Interaction in Rb2SnBr6 Perovskite</title>

Abstract: Due to their well-suited optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites are emerging semiconductor materials with potential applications in solar cells, detectors, and light-emitting diodes. Beyond the traditional 3D perovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as excitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced dimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such phenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL) response in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the intrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6 perovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband emission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs). The Fr\"ohlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic charge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for the emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The EPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming strong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and supporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation was evaluated by the Fr\"ohlich parameter {\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and 4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron quasi-particle on exciton trapping. Our findings give insights regarding the influence of EPC in 0D perovskites and STE formation, which leads to the assessment of Rb2SnBr6 for light-harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Enhancement of Spin Pumping in Pt/YIG Bilayers</title>

Abstract: Enhancing spin-to-charge (S$\rightarrow$C) conversion efficiency remains a key challenge in spintronic materials research. In this work we investigate the effect of substrate-induced strains onto the S$\rightarrow$C efficiency. On one hand, we analyze strains-induced magnetic anisotropies in yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) by comparing the magnetic and structural properties of YIG films grown on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (GGG) and (CaGd)$_3$(MgZrGa)$_5$O$_{12}$ (SGGG) substrates. Differences in lattice mismatch - YIG//GGG ($\eta = -0.06 \%$) and YIG//SGGG ($\eta = -0.83 \%$) - lead to out-of-plane tensile strains in the first case and unexpected compressive strain in the latter. On the other hand, we study the spin injection efficiency on Pt/YIG bilayers evaluated by the Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE). We find that the resulting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in YIG//SGGG, while not dominant over shape anisotropy, correlates with enhanced ISHE signals as observed in Spin Pumping Ferromagnetic Resonance (SP-FMR) and Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) experiments. Strain engineering proves effective in enhancing spin-to-charge conversion, providing insight into the design of efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of Metal-Ligand Redox in Li-ion Battery Positive Electrodes</title>

Abstract: Describing Li-ion battery positive electrodes in terms of distinct transition metal or oxygen redox regimes can lead to confusion in understanding metal-ligand hybridisation, oxygen dimerisation, and degradation. There is a pressing need to study the electronic structure of these materials and determine the role each cation and anion plays in charge compensation. Here, we employ transition metal L-edge X-ray Resonance Photoemission Spectroscopy in conjunction with Single Impurity Anderson models, Self-consistent Real Space Multiple Scattering spectral simulations, and Dynamical Mean-Field theory calculations to directly evaluate the redox mechanisms in (de-)lithiated battery electrodes. This approach reconciles the redox description of two canonical cathodes -- LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$ and LiNiO$_{2}$ -- in terms of varying degrees of charge transfer using the established Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen framework, common to condensed matter physics. In LiMn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$PO$_{4}$, the absence of charge transfer means capacity arises due to the depopulation of metal $\textit{3d}$ states, i.e. conventional metal redox. Whereas, in LiNiO$_{2}$, charge transfer dominates and redox occurs through the formation and elimination of ligand hole states. This work clarifies the role of oxygen in Ni-rich system and provides a framework to explain how capacity can be extracted from oxygen-dominated states in highly covalent systems without needing to invoke dimerisation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the epitaxial Si$_3$N$_4$ crystalline cap on AlGaN/GaN via evolutionary structure search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our recent experimental work (Appl. Phys. Lett. 125, 122109 (2024)), we observed that crystalline Si$_3$N$_4$ cap layers a few nanometers thick can form in situ on GaN surfaces. Compared with amorphous SiO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ caps, these crystalline caps yield cleaner GaN/Si$_3$N$_4$ interfaces with fewer defects and improved device performance. These observations raise two questions: why does Si$_3$N$_4$ away from the interface become amorphous as the cap thickens, and what is the actual crystal structure of the interfacial Si$_3$N$_4$? Previous work proposed a defect-wurtzite (DW) model constructed heuristically from $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and the AlGaN lattice constants, but this model is significantly higher in energy than $\beta$-Si$_3$N$_4$ and disagrees with experiment in both interlayer spacings and electronic gap. Using a systematic structure-search approach under in-plane lattice constraints commensurate with AlGaN, we identify a lower-energy configuration, denoted Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$, with quasi-two-dimensional (laminar) stacking normal to the interface. Under AlGaN-matched metrics, Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ is about 60 meV/atom more stable than DW-Si$_3$N$_4$ and reproduces the experimentally observed interlayer spacings more closely. The substantial lattice mismatch explains amorphization when the crystalline cap grows far from the interface. Upon full relaxation, both DW- and Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ exhibit wide $\sim$4 eV band gaps. Under AlGaN constraints, the DW gap collapses to $\sim$1.88 eV whereas Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ maintains a larger $\sim$2.70 eV gap (for reference, PBE gaps: GaN 1.73 eV, AlN 4.05 eV). The wider gap and improved structural match of Lam-Si$_3$N$_4$ rationalize the superior capping performance and provide guidance for optimizing AlGaN/GaN device encapsulation.</description>

      <title>Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanofabrication of topological insulator (TI) devices is essential for accessing edge and interface states, but conventional lithography and etching compromise the atomically clean surfaces required for scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We demonstrate a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ lithographic patterning with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum cleaving and flipping, yielding atomically clean, nanopatterned TI-superconductor heterostructures suitable for STM/STS. In Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film and capping with Nb. This enabled spectroscopy on large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. In Design II, local thinning defined buried nanoribbons within a continuous TI film, producing pristine planar surfaces. STM/STS revealed well-developed superconducting gaps in the surrounding film, with suppressed gaps on the nanoribbons, consistent with vertical proximity coupling. This approach establishes a reproducible pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of proximitized nanostructures, providing a scalable platform for exploring topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport and the impact of hydrogen adsorption in Linde Type A zeolitic imidazolate frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal transport in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of practical interest in diverse applications such as gas storage and separations, since insufficient heat dissipation can lead to detrimental effects. Despite investigations, influence of molecular infiltration on the heat transport remains unclear in many of MOFs due to poor understanding of mechanisms governing heat conductions. Here, we report molecular dynamics investigations of thermal transport properties in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). We investigated Linde Type A topological ZIFs (ZIF-lta) exhibiting exceptionally low thermal conductivity with unusual trend of temperature dependence deviating from many crystalline materials, despite long-range crystalline order in them. We demonstrate that heat is predominantly carried by phonons with mean free paths comparable to their wavelengths, analogous to diffusons in amorphous solids owing to strong anharmonicity caused by complexity of unit cell consisting of a large number of metal centers. We further show that adsorbed hydrogen molecules increase thermal conductivity of ZIFs, mainly contributed by additional vibrational modes, as a result of gas-gas or gas-framework interactions. Our work advances fundamental understanding into the thermal transport in MOFs and suggests a means to engineer heat conduction via gas infiltrations.</description>

      <title>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>Beyond conventional half-metals: gapless states and spin gapless semiconducting behavior in X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) Heusler compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for high-performance spintronic materials motivates the exploration of Heusler alloys with unconventional electronic properties. Using density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$ eV), we investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states, which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.</description>

Abstract: We study the structural properties and phase stability of the K$_{x}$Ca$_{1-x}$N alloy using the regular-solution model based on the total energy of the mixing. The pseudopotential approach was used along with PBE functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). We investigated the bond-lengths distribution as a function of composition $x$. We also predicted the phase separation of the two partially miscible components and calculated the enthalpy $\Delta H$ using the interaction parameter $\Omega$. We observe an asymmetry about $x=0.46$ in the phase diagram due to the $x$-dependant interaction parameter $\Omega=12.69-1.32x$ kcal/mole. The equilibrium solubility limit, known as the miscibility gap is found to be around 3033 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoporous materials hold promise for diverse sustainable applications, yet their vast chemical space poses challenges for efficient design. Machine learning offers a compelling pathway to accelerate the exploration, but existing models lack either interpretability or fidelity for elucidating the correlation between crystal geometry and property. Here, we report a three-dimensional periodic space sampling method that decomposes large nanoporous structures into local geometrical sites for combined property prediction and site-wise contribution quantification. Trained with a constructed database and retrieved datasets, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency for property prediction on gas storage, separation, and electrical conduction. Meanwhile, this approach enables the interpretation of the prediction and allows for accurate identification of significant local sites for targeted properties. Through identifying transferable high-performance sites across diverse nanoporous frameworks, our model paves the way for interpretable, symmetry-aware nanoporous materials design, which is extensible to other materials, like molecular crystals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: a practical recipe for four-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced Diffusion Transport in Flat-band Systems with Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our previous understanding of transport in disordered system depends on the assumption that there is a well-defined Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in the system such as the diffusion length and localization length. However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a 1D Lieb lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation.</description>

      <title>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Stirring Time on Formation of Microplastics Fragmented from Photo-aged Polypropylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of microplastic (MP) size distributions fragmented from photo-aged polypropylene (PP) in stirred water. PP specimens fragmented into MPs with their size of 1-30 um after UV irradiation and stirring in laboratory settings. These laboratory-fragmented MPs were dispersed into the water during the stirring process. A series of MP size distributions was analyzed from optical microscope images of obtained MPs. The MP size distribution was described by an exponential function in the short stirring time domain, whereas it changed to a power-law function as the stirring time increased. The fragmentation rate of MPs and nanoplastics (NPs) decreased with increasing stirring time. The obtained MP exhibited higher crystallinity than the photo-aged PP specimen after stirring. This result implies that MP fragmentation, as observed under controlled laboratory conditions, is related with the chemi-crystallization of PP.</description>

      <title>Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekul\'{e}-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</description>
