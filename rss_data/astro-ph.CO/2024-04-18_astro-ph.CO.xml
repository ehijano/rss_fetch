      <title>Beyond MACS: Physical properties of extremely X-ray luminous clusters at $z &gt; 0.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of over 100 highly X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at $z\sim$ 0.5-0.9, discovered by the extended Massive Cluster Survey (eMACS) in ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) data. Follow-up observations of a subset at higher resolution and greater depth with the Chandra X-ray Observatory are used to map the gaseous intra-cluster medium, while strong-gravitational-lensing features identified in Hubble Space Telescope imaging allow us to constrain the total mass distribution. We present evidence of the exceptional gravitational-lensing power of these massive systems, search for substructure along the line of sight by mapping the radial velocities of cluster members obtained through extensive ground-based spectroscopy, and identify dramatic cases of galaxy evolution in high-density cluster environments. The available observations of the eMACS sample presented here provide a wealth of insights into the properties of very massive clusters ($\gtrsim 10^{15} M_\odot$) at $z &gt; 0.5$, which act as powerful lenses to study galaxies in the very distant Universe. We also discuss the evolutionary state, galaxy population, and large-scale environment of eMACS clusters and release to the community all data and science products to further the understanding of the first generation of truly massive clusters to have formed in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Probing the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization using 21-cm signal power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshifted 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR) directly probes the ionization and thermal states of the intergalactic medium during that period. In particular, the distribution of the ionized regions around the radiating sources during EoR introduces scale-dependent features in the spherically-averaged EoR 21-cm signal power spectrum. The goal is to study these scale-dependent features at different stages of reionization using numerical simulations and build a source model-independent framework to probe the properties of the intergalactic medium using EoR 21-cm signal power spectrum measurements. Under the assumption of high spin temperature, we modelled the redshift evolution of the ratio of EoR 21-cm brightness temperature power spectrum and the corresponding density power spectrum using an ansatz consisting of a set of redshift and scale-independent parameters. This set of eight parameters probes the redshift evolution of the average ionization fraction and the quantities related to the morphology of the ionized regions. We have tested this ansatz on different reionization scenarios generated using different simulation algorithms and found that it is able to recover the redshift evolution of the average neutral fraction within an absolute deviation $\lesssim 0.1$. Our framework allows us to interpret 21-cm signal power spectra in terms of parameters related to the state of the IGM. This source model-independent framework can efficiently constrain reionization scenarios using multi-redshift power spectrum measurements with ongoing and future radio telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, HERA, and SKA. This will add independent information regarding the EoR IGM properties.</description>

      <title>Soft Photon Heating: A Semi-Analytic Framework and Applications to $21$cm Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of an abundant population of low frequency photons at high redshifts (such as a radio background) can source leading order effects on the evolution of the matter and spin temperatures through rapid free-free absorptions. This effect, known as soft photon heating, can have a dramatic impact on the differential brightness temperature, $\Delta T_{\rm b}$, a central observable in $21$cm cosmology. Here, we introduce a semi-analytic framework to describe the dynamics of soft photon heating, providing a simplified set of evolution equations and a useful numerical scheme which can be used to study this generic effect. We also perform quasi-instantaneous and continuous soft photon injections to elucidate the different regimes in which soft photon heating is expected to impart a significant contribution to the global $21$cm signal and its fluctuations. We find that soft photon backgrounds produced after recombination with spectral index $\gamma &gt; 3.0$ undergo significant free-free absorption, and therefore this heating effect cannot be neglected. The effect becomes stronger with steeper spectral index, and in some cases the injection of a synchrotron-like spectrum ($\gamma = 3.6$) can suppress the amplitude of $\Delta T_{\rm b}$ relative to the standard model prediction, making the global $21$cm signal even more difficult to detect in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Does dark energy really revive using DESI 2024 data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 data on dark energy scenarios. We thus analyze three typologies of models, the first in which the cosmic speed up is related to thermodynamics, the second associated with Taylor expansions of the barotropic factor, whereas the third based on \emph{ad hoc} dark energy parameterizations. In this respect, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, adopting the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, of 12 models. To do so, we first work at the background, inferring \emph{a posteriori} kinematic quantities associated with each model. Afterwards, we obtain early time predictions, computing departures on the growth evolution with respect to the model that better fits DESI data. We find that the best model to fit data \emph{is not} the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, but rather a more complicated log-corrected dark energy contribution. To check the goodness of our findings, we further directly fit the product, $r_d h_0$, concluding that $r_d h_0$ is anticorrelated with the mass. This treatment is worked out by removing a precise data point placed at $z=0.51$. Surprisingly, in this case the results again align with the $\Lambda$CDM model, \emph{indicating that the possible tension between the concordance paradigm and the CPL model can be severely alleviated}. We conclude that future data points will be essential to clarify whether dynamical dark energy is really in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Big Bang equivalence of $f(R)$ gravity with no cosmological lithium problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $f(R)$ gravity is one of the serious alternatives of general relativity having large range of astronomical consequences. In this work, we study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in $f(R)$ gravity theory. We consider modification to gravity due to the existence of primordial black holes in the radiation era which introduce additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. We calculate the light element abundances by using the BBN code PArthENoPE. It is found that for a range of scalaron mass $(2.2-3.5) \times 10^4$ eV, the abundance of lithium is lowered by $3-4$ times the value predicted by general relativistic BBN which is a level desired to address the cosmological lithium problem. For the above scalaron mass range helium abundance is within observed bound. However, deuterium abundance is found to be increased by $3-6$ times the observed primordial abundance which calls for high efficiency of stellar formation and evolution processes for destruction of the same. A novel relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass has been used to estimate that the above scalaron mass range corresponds to primordial black holes of sub-planetary mass ($\sim 10^{19}$ g) serving as one of the potential non-baryonic dark matter candidates. We infer Big Bang equivalence of power law $f(R)$ gravity with primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Data reconstruction of the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parameterized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. Firstly, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma(z)$, and we show that according to AIC and BIC information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Improving cosmological constraints using a new multi-tracer method with the spectroscopic and photometric samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future data provided by the \Euclid mission will allow us to better understand the cosmic history of the Universe. A metric of its performance is the figure-of-merit (FoM) of dark energy, usually estimated with Fisher forecasts. The expected FoM has previously been estimated taking into account the two main probes of \Euclid, namely the three-dimensional clustering of the spectroscopic galaxy sample, and the so-called 3$\times$2\,pt signal from the photometric sample (i.e., the weak lensing signal, the galaxy clustering, and their cross-correlation). So far, these two probes have been treated as independent. In this paper, we introduce a new observable given by the ratio of the (angular) two-point correlation function of galaxies from the two surveys. For identical (normalised) selection functions, this observable is unaffected by sampling noise, and its variance is solely controlled by Poisson noise. We present forecasts for \Euclid where this multi-tracer method is applied and is particularly relevant because the two surveys will cover the same area of the sky. This method allows for the exploitation of the combination of the spectroscopic and photometric samples. When the correlation between this new observable and the other probes is not taken into account, a significant gain is obtained in the FoM, as well as in the constraints on other cosmological parameters. The benefit is more pronounced for a commonly investigated modified gravity model, namely the $\gamma$ parametrisation of the growth factor. However, the correlation between the different probes is found to be significant and hence the actual gain is uncertain. We present various strategies for circumventing this issue and still extract useful information from the new observable.</description>

      <title>Modeling nonlinear scales with COLA: preparing for LSST-Y1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Year 1 results of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide tighter constraints on small-scale cosmology, beyond the validity of linear perturbation theory. This heightens the demand for a computationally affordable prescription that can accurately capture nonlinearities in beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models. The COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method, a cost-effective \textit{N}-body technique, has been proposed as a viable alternative to high-resolution \textit{N}-body simulations for training emulators of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. In this study, we evaluate this approach by employing COLA emulators to conduct a cosmic shear analysis with LSST-Y1 simulated data across three different nonlinear scale cuts. We use the $w$CDM model, for which the \textsc{EuclidEmulator2} (\textsc{ee2}) exists as a benchmark, having been trained with high-resolution \textit{N}-body simulations. We primarily utilize COLA simulations with mass resolution $M_{\rm part}\approx 8 \times 10^{10} ~h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and force resolution $\ell_{\rm force}=0.5 ~h^{-1}$Mpc, though we also test refined settings with $M_{\rm part}\approx 1 \times 10^{10} ~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ and force resolution $\ell_{\rm force}=0.17 ~h^{-1}$Mpc. We find the performance of the COLA emulators is sensitive to the placement of high-resolution \textit{N}-body reference samples inside the prior, which only ensure agreement in their local vicinity. However, the COLA emulators pass stringent criteria in goodness-of-fit and parameter bias throughout the prior, when $\Lambda$CDM predictions of \textsc{ee2} are computed alongside every COLA emulator prediction, suggesting a promising approach for extended models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the luminosity distance of propagating gravitational waves can provide invaluable information on the geometry and content of our Universe. Due to the clustering of cosmic structures, in realistic situations we need to average the luminosity distance of events coming from patches inside a volume. In this work we evaluate, in a gauge-invariant and fully-relativistic treatment, the impact of cosmological perturbations on such averaging process. We find that clustering, lensing and peculiar velocity effects impact estimates for future detectors such as Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer and DECIGO. The signal-to-noise ratio of the angular power spectrum of the average luminosity distance over all the redshift bins is 17 in the case of binary black holes detected by Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We also provide fitting formulas for the corrections to the average luminosity distance due to general relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>First Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Galaxy Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ c.l.) of the all flavour high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $2.57\times 10^{-18}$, $8.51 \times 10^{-19}$ and $2.36 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^2\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>The Field Theory Axiverse</title>

Abstract: Axion and axion-like particles (ALPs) are a prominent candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model, and can play an important role in cosmology, serving as dark matter or dark energy, or both, drawing motivation in part from the string theory axiverse. Axion-like particles (ALPs) can also arise as composite degrees of freedom following chiral symmetry breaking in a dark confining gauge theory, analogous to the Standard Model (SM) pion. A dark sector with arbitrary $N_f$ flavors of dark quarks leads to $N_f^2-1$ axion-like states, effectively a field theory axiverse (or '$\pi$-axiverse'). A portal to the visible sector can be achieved through the standard kinetic mixing between the dark photon and SM photon, generating millicharges for the dark quarks and consequently couplings, both parity-even and parity-odd, between the SM and the dark pions. This scenario has been studied for the $N_f=2$ case and more recently for a dark Standard Model with $N_f=6$. In this work, we study the spectrum of this field theory axiverse for an arbitrary number of flavors, and apply this to the example $N_f=10$. We calculate the couplings to the SM photon analogous to the conventional axion-photon coupling, including the $N_f$ and $N_c$ dependence, and compute the present and future constraints on the $N_f=10$, $N_c=3$, $\pi$-axiverse. We elucidate the accompanying 'bary-verse' of superheavy dark baryons, namely an ensemble of charged and neutral dark baryons with a mass set by the dark pion decay constant.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxy of a Dormant, Overmassive Black Hole at $z=6.7$ May Be Restarting Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is discovering a large population of $z&gt;4$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are overmassive with respect to the stellar content of their hosts. A previous study developed a physical model to interpret this overmassive population as the result of quasar feedback acting on a compact host galaxy. In this Note, we apply this model to JADES GN 1146115, a dormant supermassive black hole at $z=6.7$ whose mass is $\sim40\%$ of the host's mass in stars and accreting at $\sim2\%$ of the Eddington limit. The host has been forming stars at the low rate of $\sim 1 \, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ for the past $\sim 100$ Myr. Our model suggests that this galactic system is on the verge of a resurgence of global star formation activity. This transition comes after a period of domination by the effect of its overmassive black hole, whose duration is comparable to typical quasar lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation and Dark Sector from 11D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the four-dimensional FRW universe emerges as a solution representing cosmological D3-branes in the eleven-dimensional bulk. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <title>The relic density and temperature evolution of light dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a set of four fully coupled Boltzmann equations to precisely determine the relic density and temperature of dark matter by including three distinct sectors: dark matter, light scalar, and standard model sectors. The intricacies of heat transfer between DM and the SM sector through a light scalar particle are explored, inspired by stringent experimental constraints on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle and the DM-scalar coupling. Three distinct sectors emerge prior to DM freeze-out, requiring fully coupled Boltzmann equations to accurately compute relic density. Investigation of forbidden, resonance, and secluded DM scenarios demonstrates significant deviations between established methods and the novel approach with fully coupled Boltzmann equations. Despite increased computational demands, this emphasizes the need for improved precision in relic density calculations, underlining the importance of incorporating these equations in comprehensive analyses.</description>

      <title>floZ: Evidence estimation from posterior samples with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method (floZ), based on normalizing flows, for estimating the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a k-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. It has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate the evidence from variational inference, Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples from the unnormalized posterior density.</description>

      <title>Sound speed as a source of the gravitational field in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity and other modified theories of gravity, the knowledge of the first order variation of the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor with respect to the metric is essential for an accurate characterization of the gravitational field. In this paper, by considering a paradigmatic example of a perfect fluid whose dynamics is described by a pure k-essence matter Lagrangian in $f(R,T)=R+\mathcal F(T)$ gravity, we show that the first order variation of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor cannot in general be determined from the proper density, proper pressure and 4-velocity of the fluid alone, and that the sound speed of the fluid can directly influence the dynamics of gravity. We also confirm that the second variation of the matter Lagrangian with respect to the metric should not in general be neglected. These results can be particularly relevant for cosmological studies of $f(R,T)$ gravity in which some of the material content of the Universe is modeled as a perfect fluid.</description>

      <title>B-mode polarization forecasts for GreenPol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present tensor-to-scalar ratio forecasts for GreenPol, a hypothetical ground-based B-mode experiment aiming to survey the cleanest regions of the Northern Galactic Hemisphere at five frequencies between 10 and 44 GHz. Its primary science goal would be to measure large-scale CMB polarization fluctuations at multipoles $\ell \lesssim 500$, and thereby constrain the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio. The observations for the suggested experiment would take place at the Summit Station (72deg N, 38deg W) on Greenland, at an altitude of 3216 m above sea level. In this paper we simulate various experimental setups, and derive limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio after CMB component separation using a Bayesian component separation implementation called Commander. When combining the proposed experiment with Planck HFI observations for constraining polarized thermal dust emission, we find a projected limit of r&lt;0.02 at 95 % confidence for the baseline configuration. This limit is very robust with respect to a range of important experimental parameters, including sky coverage, detector weighting, foreground priors etc. Overall, GreenPol would have the possibility to provide deep CMB polarization measurements of the Northern Galactic Hemisphere at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>The Local Value of H$_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the local determination of the Hubble constant, H$_0$, focusing on recent measurements of a distance ladder constructed from geometry, Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We explain in some detail the components of the ladder: (1) geometry from Milky Way parallaxes, masers in NGC 4258 and detached eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud; (2) measurements of Cepheids with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in these anchors and in the hosts of 42 SNe Ia; and (3) SNe Ia in the Hubble flow. Great attention to negating systematic uncertainties through the use of differential measurements is reviewed. A wide array of tests are discussed. The measurements provide a strong indication of a discrepancy between the local measure of H$_0$ and its value predicted by $\Lambda$CDM theory, calibrated by the cosmic microwave background ($Planck$), a decade-long challenge known as the `Hubble Tension'. We present new measurements with the James Webb Space Telescope of $&gt;$320 Cepheids on both rungs of the distance ladder, in a SN Ia host and the geometric calibrator NGC 4258, showing reduced noise and good agreement with the same as measured with HST. This provides strong evidence that systematic errors in HST Cepheid photometry do not play a significant role in the present Hubble Tension. Future measurements are expected to refine the local determination of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of generating light Dirac neutrino mass via scotogenic mechanism where singlet-doublet fermion dark matter (DM) plays non-trivial role in generating one-loop neutrino mass, anomalous magnetic moment of muon $(g-2)_\mu$ as well as additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We show that the Dirac nature of neutrinos can bring interesting correlations within the parameter space satisfying the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly and DM relic density and the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$. While we stick to thermal singlet doublet DM with promising detection prospects, both thermal and non-thermal origin of $\Delta{N_{\rm eff}}$ have been explored. In addition to detection prospects at DM, $(g-2)$ and other particle physics experiments, the model remains verifiable at future CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SPT-3G.</description>

      <title>The neutrino fog for dark matter-electron scattering experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for sub-GeV dark matter via scattering on electrons has ramped up in the last few years. Like in the case of dark matter scattering on nuclei, electron-recoil-based searches also face an ultimate background in the form of neutrinos. The so-called ``neutrino fog'' refers to the range of open dark-matter parameter space where the background of neutrinos can potentially prevent a conclusive discovery claim of a dark matter signal from being made. In this study, we map the neutrino fog for a range of electron recoil experiments based on silicon, germanium, xenon and argon targets. In analogy to the nuclear recoil case, we also calculate the ''edge'' to the neutrino fog, which can be used as a visual guide to where neutrinos become an important background -- this boundary excludes some parts of the key theory milestones used to motivate these experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In certain models of inflation, the postinflationary reheating of the Universe is not primarily due to perturbative decay of the inflaton field into particles, but proceeds through a tachyonic instability. In the process, long-wavelength modes of an unstable field, which is often distinct from the inflaton itself, acquire very large occupation numbers, which are subsequently redistributed into a thermal equilibrium state. We investigate this process numerically through quantum real-time lattice simulations of the Kadanoff-Baym equation, using a 1/N-NLO truncation of the 2PI-effective action. We identify the early-time maximum occupation number, the "classical" momentum range, the validity of the classical approximation and the effective IR temperature, and study the kinetic equilibration of the system and the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the escape of Ly$\alpha$ at $z\approx 5-6$: a census of Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction with H$\alpha$ emitting galaxies spectroscopically confirmed by JWST and VLT/MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST provides an unprecedented opportunity for unbiased surveys of H$\alpha$-emitting galaxies at $z&gt;4$ with the NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS). In this work, we present a census of Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$) of 165 star-forming galaxies at $z=4.9-6.3$ using their H$\alpha$ emission directly measured from FRESCO NIRCam/WFSS data. We search for Ly$\alpha$ emission of each H$\alpha$-emitting galaxy in VLT/MUSE data. The overall $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ measured by stacking is $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ is $0.090\pm0.006$. We find that $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ displays a strong dependence on the observed UV slope ($\beta_{\rm obs}$) and E(B-V), such that the bluest galaxies ($\beta_{\rm obs}\sim-2.5$) have the largest escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc, Ly\alpha}\approx0.6$), indicative of the crucial role of dust and gas in modulating the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons. $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ is less well related to other parameters, including the UV luminosity and stellar mass, and the variation in $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ with them can be explained by their underlying coupling with E(B-V) or $\beta_{\rm obs}$. Our results suggest a tentative decline in $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ at $z\gtrsim 5$, implying increasing intergalactic medium attenuation towards higher redshift. Furthermore, the dependence of $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ on $\beta_{\rm obs}$ is proportional to that of the ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc, LyC}$), indicating the escape of Ly$\alpha$ and ionizing photon may be regulated by similar physical processes. With $f_{esc, Ly\alpha}$ as a proxy to $f_{\rm esc, LyC}$, we infer that UV-faint ($M_{\rm UV}&gt;-16$) galaxies contribute $&gt;70\%$ of the total ionizing emissivity at $z=5-6$. If these relations hold during the epoch of reionization, UV-faint galaxies can contribute the majority of UV photon budget to reionize the Universe.</description>

      <title>Some Old Globular Clusters (and Stars) Inferring That the Universe Is Older Than Commonly Accepted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made startling discoveries regarding the early universe. It has revealed galaxies as soon as 300 million years after the Big Bang, challenging current galaxy formation models. Additionally, it has identified massive, bright galaxies in the young universe, contradicting the standard {\Lambda}CDM model's age estimate of 13.8 Gyr. This prompts a reevaluation of galaxy formation and cosmological models. There is a strong tension between JWST high-redshift galaxy observations and Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) satellite measurements. Even alternative cosmological models, including those incorporating dark matter baryon interaction, f(R) gravity, and dynamical dark have failed to resolve this tension. One possible solution is that the Universe's age exceeds predictions by the {\Lambda}CDM model. The study challenges this by introducing a method based on blue straggler stars (BSs) within GCs, comparing ages with other models. The ages obtained are compared with those of different models to certify that they are equally valid. These values are comparable within the error ranges except for the clusters: NGC104, NGC 5634, IC 4499, NGC 6273 and NGC 4833, finding their respective ages to be between 14.7 and 21.6 Gyr, surpassing the commonly accepted age of the Universe. These results inferred an age for the Universe of around 26 Gyr, close to 26.7 Gyr. This value aligns with that suggested by the cosmological model named Covarying Coupling Constants + TL (CCC+TL). Such a value is consistent with early universe observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The results of the present paper reinforce the advocating for a critical review of models encompassing dark mass, dark energy, and the dynamics of the Universe, particularly in explaining the presence of primitive massive galaxies, very old GCs, and very old and poor metallic stars.</description>

Abstract: Radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies are prominent reservoirs of magnetic fields and of non-thermal particles, which get mixed with the intracluster medium. We review the observational and theoretical knowledge of the role of these crucial ingredients for the formation of diffuse radio emission in clusters (radio halos, relics, mini halos) and outline the open questions in this field.</description>

      <title>Prospects of the multi-channel photometric survey telescope in the cosmological application of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a real-time, three-color photometric system designed to capture the color evolution of stars and transients accurately. This telescope system can be crucial in cosmological distance measurements of low-redshift (low-$z$, $z$ $\lesssim 0.1$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). To optimize the capabilities of this instrument, we perform a comprehensive simulation study before its official operation is scheduled to start. By considering the impact of atmospheric extinction, weather conditions, and the lunar phase at the observing site involving the instrumental features, we simulate the light curves of SNe Ia obtained by the Mephisto. The best strategy in the case of SN Ia cosmology is to take the image at an exposure time of 130 s with a cadence of 3 days. In this condition, Mephisto can obtain hundreds of high-quality SNe Ia to achieve a distance measurement better than $4.5\%$. Given the on-time spectral classification and monitoring of the Lijiang 2.4 m Telescope at the same observatory, Mephisto, in the whole operation, can significantly enrich the well-calibrated sample of supernovae at low-$z$ and improve the calibration accuracy of high-$z$ SNe Ia.</description>
