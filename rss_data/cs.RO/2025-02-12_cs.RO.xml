      <title>Cross-platform Learning-based Fault Tolerant Surfacing Controller for Underwater Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cross-platform fault-tolerant surfacing controller for underwater robots, based on reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike conventional approaches, which require explicit identification of malfunctioning actuators, our method allows the robot to surface using only the remaining operational actuators without needing to pinpoint the failures. The proposed controller learns a robust policy capable of handling diverse failure scenarios across different actuator configurations. Moreover, we introduce a transfer learning mechanism that shares a part of the control policy across various underwater robots with different actuators, thus improving learning efficiency and generalization across platforms. To validate our approach, we conduct simulations on three different types of underwater robots: a hovering-type AUV, a torpedo shaped AUV, and a turtle-shaped robot (U-CAT). Additionally, real-world experiments are performed, successfully transferring the learned policy from simulation to a physical U-CAT in a controlled environment. Our RL-based controller demonstrates superior performance in terms of stability and success rate compared to a baseline controller, achieving an 85.7 percent success rate in real-world tests compared to 57.1 percent with a baseline controller. This research provides a scalable and efficient solution for fault-tolerant control for diverse underwater platforms, with potential applications in real-world aquatic missions.</description>

      <title>A Safe Hybrid Control Framework for Car-like Robot with Guaranteed Global Path-Invariance using a Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid framework for car-like robots with obstacle avoidance, global convergence, and safety, where safety is interpreted as path invariance, namely, once the robot converges to the path, it never leaves the path. Given a priori obstacle-free feasible path where obstacles can be around the path, the task is to avoid obstacles while reaching the path and then staying on the path without leaving it. The problem is solved in two stages. Firstly, we define a ``tight'' obstacle-free neighborhood along the path and design a local controller to ensure convergence to the path and path invariance. The control barrier function technology is involved in the control design to steer the system away from its singularity points, where the local path invariant controller is not defined. Secondly, we design a hybrid control framework that integrates this local path-invariant controller with any global tracking controller from the existing literature without path invariance guarantee, ensuring convergence from any position to the desired path, namely, global convergence. This framework guarantees path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. Detailed simulation results affirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</description>

      <title>Space-Aware Instruction Tuning: Dataset and Benchmark for Guide Dog Robots Assisting the Visually Impaired</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guide dog robots offer promising solutions to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals, addressing the limitations of traditional guide dogs, particularly in perceptual intelligence and communication. With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM</description>

      <title>Parameter Optimization of Optical Six-Axis Force/Torque Sensor for Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel six-axis force/torque sensor tailored for compact and lightweight legged robots. Unlike traditional strain gauge-based sensors, the proposed non-contact design employs photocouplers, enhancing resistance to physical impacts and reducing damage risk. This approach simplifies manufacturing, lowers costs, and meets the demands of legged robots by combining small size, light weight, and a wide force measurement range. A methodology for optimizing sensor parameters is also presented, focusing on maximizing sensitivity and minimizing error. Precise modeling and analysis of objective functions enabled the derivation of optimal design parameters. The sensor's performance was validated through extensive testing and integration into quadruped robots, demonstrating alignment with theoretical modeling. The sensor's precise measurement capabilities make it suitable for diverse robotic environments, particularly in analyzing interactions between robot feet and the ground. This innovation addresses existing sensor limitations while contributing to advancements in robotics and sensor technology, paving the way for future applications in robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Confidence: Adaptive Abstention in Dual-Threshold Conformal Prediction for Autonomous System Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical perception systems require both reliable uncertainty quantification and principled abstention mechanisms to maintain safety under diverse operational conditions. We present a novel dual-threshold conformalization framework that provides statistically-guaranteed uncertainty estimates while enabling selective prediction in high-risk scenarios. Our approach uniquely combines a conformal threshold ensuring valid prediction sets with an abstention threshold optimized through ROC analysis, providing distribution-free coverage guarantees (\ge 1 - \alpha) while identifying unreliable predictions. Through comprehensive evaluation on CIFAR-100, ImageNet1K, and ModelNet40 datasets, we demonstrate superior robustness across camera and LiDAR modalities under varying environmental perturbations. The framework achieves exceptional detection performance (AUC: 0.993\to0.995) under severe conditions while maintaining high coverage (&gt;90.0\%) and enabling adaptive abstention (13.5\%\to63.4\%\pm0.5) as environmental severity increases. For LiDAR-based perception, our approach demonstrates particularly strong performance, maintaining robust coverage (&gt;84.5\%) while appropriately abstaining from unreliable predictions. Notably, the framework shows remarkable stability under heavy perturbations, with detection performance (AUC: 0.995\pm0.001) significantly outperforming existing methods across all modalities. Our unified approach bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical deployment needs, offering a robust solution for safety-critical autonomous systems operating in challenging real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Leader-follower formation enabled by pressure sensing in free-swimming undulatory robotic fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fish use their lateral lines to sense flows and pressure gradients, enabling them to detect nearby objects and organisms. Towards replicating this capability, we demonstrated successful leader-follower formation swimming using flow pressure sensing in our undulatory robotic fish ($\mu$Bot/MUBot). The follower $\mu$Bot is equipped at its head with bilateral pressure sensors to detect signals excited by both its own and the leader's movements. First, using experiments with static formations between an undulating leader and a stationary follower, we determined the formation that resulted in strong pressure variations measured by the follower. This formation was then selected as the desired formation in free swimming for obtaining an expert policy. Next, a long short-term memory neural network was used as the control policy that maps the pressure signals along with the robot motor commands and the Euler angles (measured by the onboard IMU) to the steering command. The policy was trained to imitate the expert policy using behavior cloning and Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). The results show that with merely two bilateral pressure sensors and less than one hour of training data, the follower effectively tracked the leader within distances of up to 200 mm (= 1 body length) while swimming at speeds of 155 mm/s (= 0.8 body lengths/s). This work highlights the potential of fish-inspired robots to effectively navigate fluid environments and achieve formation swimming through the use of flow pressure feedback.</description>

      <title>SymbioSim: Human-in-the-loop Simulation Platform for Bidirectional Continuing Learning in Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of intelligent robots seeks to seamlessly integrate them into the human world, providing assistance and companionship in daily life and work, with the ultimate goal of achieving human-robot symbiosis. To realize this vision, robots must continuously learn and evolve through consistent interaction and collaboration with humans, while humans need to gradually develop an understanding of and trust in robots through shared experiences. However, training and testing algorithms directly on physical robots involve substantial costs and safety risks. Moreover, current robotic simulators fail to support real human participation, limiting their ability to provide authentic interaction experiences and gather valuable human feedback. In this paper, we introduce SymbioSim, a novel human-in-the-loop robotic simulation platform designed to enable the safe and efficient development, evaluation, and optimization of human-robot interactions. By leveraging a carefully designed system architecture and modules, SymbioSim delivers a natural and realistic interaction experience, facilitating bidirectional continuous learning and adaptation for both humans and robots. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the platform's promising performance and highlight its potential to significantly advance research on human-robot symbiosis.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Wheeled Lab: Modern Sim2Real for Low-cost, Open-source Wheeled Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation has been pivotal in recent robotics milestones and is poised to play a prominent role in the field's future. However, recent robotic advances often rely on expensive and high-maintenance platforms, limiting access to broader robotics audiences. This work introduces Wheeled Lab, a framework for the low-cost, open-source wheeled platforms that are already widely established in education and research. Through integration with Isaac Lab, Wheeled Lab introduces modern techniques in Sim2Real, such as domain randomization, sensor simulation, and end-to-end learning, to new user communities. To kickstart education and demonstrate the framework's capabilities, we develop three state-of-the-art policies for small-scale RC cars: controlled drifting, elevation traversal, and visual navigation, each trained in simulation and deployed in the real world. By bridging the gap between advanced Sim2Real methods and affordable, available robotics, Wheeled Lab aims to democratize access to cutting-edge tools, fostering innovation and education in a broader robotics context. The full stack, from hardware to software, is low cost and open-source.</description>

      <title>Robotic In-Hand Manipulation for Large-Range Precise Object Movement: The RGMC Champion Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-hand manipulation using multiple dexterous fingers is a critical robotic skill that can reduce the reliance on large arm motions, thereby saving space and energy. This letter focuses on in-grasp object movement, which refers to manipulating an object to a desired pose through only finger motions within a stable grasp. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving high precision and large-range movements while maintaining a constant stable grasp. To address this problem, we propose a simple and practical approach based on kinematic trajectory optimization with no need for pretraining or object geometries, which can be easily applied to novel objects in real-world scenarios. Adopting this approach, we won the championship for the in-hand manipulation track at the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA 2024. Implementation details, discussion, and further quantitative experimental results are presented in this letter, which aims to comprehensively evaluate our approach and share our key takeaways from the competition.

      <title>Dual Arm Steering of Deformable Linear Objects in 2-D and 3-D Environments Using Euler's Elastica Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a method for steering deformable linear objects using two robot hands in environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The approach involves manipulating an elastic inextensible rod by varying the gripping endpoint positions and tangents. Closed form solutions that describe the flexible linear object shape in planar environments, Euler's elastica, are described. The paper uses these solutions to formulate criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance. These criteria are formulated as constraints in the flexible object six-dimensional configuration space that represents the robot gripping endpoint positions and tangents. In particular, this paper introduces a novel criterion that ensures the flexible object stability during steering. All safety criteria are integrated into a scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments, which is lifted into a steering scheme in three-dimensional environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. Experiments with a dual-arm robot demonstrate the method.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coverage Control for Time-Varying Spatial Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot systems are essential for environmental monitoring, particularly for tracking spatial phenomena like pollution, soil minerals, and water salinity, and more. This study addresses the challenge of deploying a multi-robot team for optimal coverage in environments where the density distribution, describing areas of interest, is unknown and changes over time. We propose a fully distributed control strategy that uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the spatial field and balance the trade-off between learning the field and optimally covering it. Unlike existing approaches, we address a more realistic scenario by handling time-varying spatial fields, where the exploration-exploitation trade-off is dynamically adjusted over time. Each robot operates locally, using only its own collected data and the information shared by the neighboring robots. To address the computational limits of GPs, the algorithm efficiently manages the volume of data by selecting only the most relevant samples for the process estimation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through several simulations and experiments, incorporating real-world data phenomena to validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Beyond Behavior Cloning: Robustness through Interactive Imitation and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) traditionally relies on demonstration data, assuming the demonstrated actions are optimal. This can lead to overfitting under noisy data, particularly when expressive models are used (e.g., the energy-based model in Implicit BC). To address this, we extend behavior cloning into an iterative process of optimal action estimation within the Interactive Imitation Learning framework. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive policy Learning from Interactive Corrections (CLIC). CLIC leverages human corrections to estimate a set of desired actions and optimizes the policy to select actions from this set. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the desired action set to optimal actions in both single and multiple optimal action cases. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments validate CLIC's advantages over existing state-of-the-art methods, including stable training of energy-based models, robustness to feedback noise, and adaptability to diverse feedback types beyond demonstrations. Our code will be publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>GaRLIO: Gravity enhanced Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, gravity has been highlighted as a crucial constraint for state estimation to alleviate potential vertical drift. Existing online gravity estimation methods rely on pose estimation combined with IMU measurements, which is considered best practice when direct velocity measurements are unavailable. However, with radar sensors providing direct velocity data-a measurement not yet utilized for gravity estimation-we found a significant opportunity to improve gravity estimation accuracy substantially. GaRLIO, the proposed gravity-enhanced Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Odometry, can robustly predict gravity to reduce vertical drift while simultaneously enhancing state estimation performance using pointwise velocity measurements. Furthermore, GaRLIO ensures robustness in dynamic environments by utilizing radar to remove dynamic objects from LiDAR point clouds. Our method is validated through experiments in various environments prone to vertical drift, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional LiDAR-Inertial Odometry methods. We make our source code publicly available to encourage further research and development. https://github.com/ChiyunNoh/GaRLIO</description>

      <title>DeepVL: Dynamics and Inertial Measurements-based Deep Velocity Learning for Underwater Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a learned model to predict the robot-centric velocity of an underwater robot through dynamics-aware proprioception. The method exploits a recurrent neural network using as inputs inertial cues, motor commands, and battery voltage readings alongside the hidden state of the previous time-step to output robust velocity estimates and their associated uncertainty. An ensemble of networks is utilized to enhance the velocity and uncertainty predictions. Fusing the network's outputs into an Extended Kalman Filter, alongside inertial predictions and barometer updates, the method enables long-term underwater odometry without further exteroception. Furthermore, when integrated into visual-inertial odometry, the method assists in enhanced estimation resilience when dealing with an order of magnitude fewer total features tracked (as few as 1) as compared to conventional visual-inertial systems. Tested onboard an underwater robot deployed both in a laboratory pool and the Trondheim Fjord, the method takes less than 5ms for inference either on the CPU or the GPU of an NVIDIA Orin AGX and demonstrates less than 4% relative position error in novel trajectories during complete visual blackout, and approximately 2% relative error when a maximum of 2 visual features from a monocular camera are available.</description>

      <title>DOGlove: Dexterous Manipulation with a Low-Cost Open-Source Haptic Force Feedback Glove</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous hand teleoperation plays a pivotal role in enabling robots to achieve human-level manipulation dexterity. However, current teleoperation systems often rely on expensive equipment and lack multi-modal sensory feedback, restricting human operators' ability to perceive object properties and perform complex manipulation tasks. To address these limitations, we present DOGlove, a low-cost, precise, and haptic force feedback glove system for teleoperation and manipulation. DoGlove can be assembled in hours at a cost under 600 USD. It features a customized joint structure for 21-DoF motion capture, a compact cable-driven torque transmission mechanism for 5-DoF multidirectional force feedback, and a linear resonate actuator for 5-DoF fingertip haptic feedback. Leveraging action and haptic force retargeting, DOGlove enables precise and immersive teleoperation of dexterous robotic hands, achieving high success rates in complex, contact-rich tasks. We further evaluate DOGlove in scenarios without visual feedback, demonstrating the critical role of haptic force feedback in task performance. In addition, we utilize the collected demonstrations to train imitation learning policies, highlighting the potential and effectiveness of DOGlove. DOGlove's hardware and software system will be fully open-sourced at https://do-glove.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Automatic Robot Task Planning by Integrating Large Language Model with Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate task planning is critical for controlling autonomous systems, such as robots, drones, and self-driving vehicles. Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Select before Act: Spatially Decoupled Action Repetition for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various continuous control tasks, such as robot manipulation and locomotion. Different to mainstream RL which makes decisions at individual steps, recent studies have incorporated action repetition into RL, achieving enhanced action persistence with improved sample efficiency and superior performance. However, existing methods treat all action dimensions as a whole during repetition, ignoring variations among them. This constraint leads to inflexibility in decisions, which reduces policy agility with inferior effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel repetition framework called SDAR, which implements Spatially Decoupled Action Repetition through performing closed-loop act-or-repeat selection for each action dimension individually. SDAR achieves more flexible repetition strategies, leading to an improved balance between action persistence and diversity. Compared to existing repetition frameworks, SDAR is more sample efficient with higher policy performance and reduced action fluctuation. Experiments are conducted on various continuous control scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatially decoupled repetition design proposed in this work.</description>

      <title>Geometry-aware RL for Manipulation of Varying Shapes and Deformable Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$
  equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.</description>

      <title>TRAVEL: Training-Free Retrieval and Alignment for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps \cite{vlmaps} on the complex R2R-Habitat \cite{r2r} instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.</description>

      <title>The Combined Problem of Online Task Assignment and Lifelong Path Finding in Logistics Warehouses: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the combined problem of online task assignment and lifelong path finding, which is crucial for the logistics industries. However, most literature either (1) focuses on lifelong path finding assuming a given task assigner, or (2) studies the offline version of this problem where tasks are known in advance. We argue that, to maximize the system throughput, the online version that integrates these two components should be tackled directly. To this end, we introduce a formal framework of the combined problem and its solution concept. Then, we design a rule-based lifelong planner under a practical robot model that works well even in environments with severe local congestion. Upon that, we automate the search for the task assigner with respect to the underlying path planner. Simulation experiments conducted in warehouse scenarios at \textit{Meituan}, one of the largest shopping platforms in China, demonstrate that (a)~\textit{in terms of time efficiency}, our system requires only 83.77\% of the execution time needed for the currently deployed system at Meituan, outperforming other SOTA algorithms by 8.09\%; (b)~\textit{in terms of economic efficiency}, ours can achieve the same throughput with only 60\% of the agents currently in use.</description>

      <title>PlaySlot: Learning Inverse Latent Dynamics for Controllable Object-Centric Video Prediction and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting future scene representations is a crucial task for enabling robots to understand and interact with the environment. However, most existing methods rely on video sequences and simulations with precise action annotations, limiting their ability to leverage the large amount of available unlabeled video data. To address this challenge, we propose PlaySlot, an object-centric video prediction model that infers object representations and latent actions from unlabeled video sequences. It then uses these representations to forecast future object states and video frames. PlaySlot allows to generate multiple possible futures conditioned on latent actions, which can be inferred from video dynamics, provided by a user, or generated by a learned action policy, thus enabling versatile and interpretable world modeling. Our results show that PlaySlot outperforms both stochastic and object-centric baselines for video prediction across different environments. Furthermore, we show that our inferred latent actions can be used to learn robot behaviors sample-efficiently from unlabeled video demonstrations. Videos and code are available at https://play-slot.github.io/PlaySlot/.</description>

      <title>NeuPAN: Direct Point Robot Navigation with End-to-End Model-based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating a nonholonomic robot in a cluttered, unknown environment requires accurate perception and precise motion control for real-time collision avoidance. This paper presents NeuPAN: a real-time, highly accurate, map-free, easy-to-deploy, and environment-invariant robot motion planner. Leveraging a tightly coupled perception-to-control framework, NeuPAN has two key innovations compared to existing approaches: 1) it directly maps raw point cloud data to a latent distance feature space for collision-free motion generation, avoiding error propagation from the perception to control pipeline; 2) it is interpretable from an end-to-end model-based learning perspective. The crux of NeuPAN is solving an end-to-end mathematical model with numerous point-level constraints using a plug-and-play (PnP) proximal alternating-minimization network (PAN), incorporating neurons in the loop. This allows NeuPAN to generate real-time, physically interpretable motions. It seamlessly integrates data and knowledge engines, and its network parameters can be fine-tuned via backpropagation. We evaluate NeuPAN on a ground mobile robot, a wheel-legged robot, and an autonomous vehicle, in extensive simulated and real-world environments. Results demonstrate that NeuPAN outperforms existing baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities across various environments, including the cluttered sandbox, office, corridor, and parking lot. We show that NeuPAN works well in unknown and unstructured environments with arbitrarily shaped objects, transforming impassable paths into passable ones.</description>

      <title>Robot Navigation in Unknown and Cluttered Workspace with Dynamical System Modulation in Starshaped Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to conventional decomposition methods that use ellipses or polygons to represent free space, starshaped representation can better capture the natural distribution of sensor data, thereby exploiting a larger portion of traversable space. This paper introduces a novel motion planning and control framework for navigating robots in unknown and cluttered environments using a dynamically constructed starshaped roadmap. Our approach generates a starshaped representation of the surrounding free space from real-time sensor data using piece-wise polynomials. Additionally, an incremental roadmap maintaining the connectivity information is constructed, and a searching algorithm efficiently selects short-term goals on this roadmap. Importantly, this framework addresses dead-end situations with a graph updating mechanism. To ensure safe and efficient movement within the starshaped roadmap, we propose a reactive controller based on Dynamic System Modulation (DSM). This controller facilitates smooth motion within starshaped regions and their intersections, avoiding conservative and short-sighted behaviors and allowing the system to handle intricate obstacle configurations in unknown and cluttered environments. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher success rates and reduced travel times compared to other methods. It effectively manages intricate obstacle configurations, avoiding conservative and myopic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Safe Interval RRT* for Scalable Multi-Robot Path Planning in Continuous Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of Multi-Robot Path Planning (MRPP) in continuous space. The difficulty of the problem arises from the extremely large search space caused by the combinatorial nature of the problem and the continuous state space. We propose a two-level approach where the low level is a sampling-based planner Safe Interval RRT* (SI-RRT*) that finds a collision-free trajectory for individual robots. The high level can use any method that can resolve inter-robot conflicts where we employ two representative methods that are Prioritized Planning (SI-CPP) and Conflict Based Search (SI-CCBS). Experimental results show that SI-RRT* can quickly find a high-quality solution with a few samples. SI-CPP exhibits improved scalability while SI-CCBS produces higher-quality solutions compared to the state-of-the-art planners for continuous space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the many recent achievements in developing and deploying social robotics, there are still many underexplored environments and applications for which systematic evaluation of such systems by end-users is necessary. While several robotic platforms have been used in gerontological healthcare, the question of whether or not a social interactive robot with multi-modal conversational capabilities will be useful and accepted in real-life facilities is yet to be answered. This paper is an attempt to partially answer this question, via two waves of experiments with patients and companions in a day-care gerontological facility in Paris with a full-sized humanoid robot endowed with social and conversational interaction capabilities. The software architecture, developed during the H2020 SPRING project, together with the experimental protocol, allowed us to evaluate the acceptability (AES) and usability (SUS) with more than 60 end-users. Overall, the users are receptive to this technology, especially when the robot perception and action skills are robust to environmental clutter and flexible to handle a plethora of different interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advancements in robotic-assisted surgery, automating complex tasks like suturing remain challenging due to the need for adaptability and precision. Learning-based approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), require realistic simulation environments for efficient data collection. However, current platforms often include only relatively simple, non-dexterous manipulations and lack the flexibility required for effective learning and generalization.
  We introduce SurgicAI, a novel platform for development and benchmarking addressing these challenges by providing the flexibility to accommodate both modular subtasks and more importantly task decomposition in RL-based surgical robotics. Compatible with the da Vinci Surgical System, SurgicAI offers a standardized pipeline for collecting and utilizing expert demonstrations. It supports deployment of multiple RL and IL approaches, and the training of both singular and compositional subtasks in suturing scenarios, featuring high dexterity and modularization. Meanwhile, SurgicAI sets clear metrics and benchmarks for the assessment of learned policies. We implemented and evaluated multiple RL and IL algorithms on SurgicAI. Our detailed benchmark analysis underscores SurgicAI's potential to advance policy learning in surgical robotics. Details: https://github.com/surgical-robotics-ai/SurgicAI</description>

      <title>MeMo: Meaningful, Modular Controllers via Noise Injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots are often built from standardized assemblies, (e.g. arms, legs, or fingers), but each robot must be trained from scratch to control all the actuators of all the parts together. In this paper we demonstrate a new approach that takes a single robot and its controller as input and produces a set of modular controllers for each of these assemblies such that when a new robot is built from the same parts, its control can be quickly learned by reusing the modular controllers. We achieve this with a framework called MeMo which learns (Me)aningful, (Mo)dular controllers. Specifically, we propose a novel modularity objective to learn an appropriate division of labor among the modules. We demonstrate that this objective can be optimized simultaneously with standard behavior cloning loss via noise injection. We benchmark our framework in locomotion and grasping environments on simple to complex robot morphology transfer. We also show that the modules help in task transfer. On both structure and task transfer, MeMo achieves improved training efficiency to graph neural network and Transformer baselines.</description>

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has played a more crucial role in various robotic control tasks, but its high computational requirements are concerning, especially for nonlinear dynamical models. This paper presents a $\textbf{la}$tent $\textbf{l}$inear $\textbf{q}$uadratic $\textbf{r}$egulator (LaLQR) that maps the state space into a latent space, on which the dynamical model is linear and the cost function is quadratic, allowing the efficient application of LQR. We jointly learn this alternative system by imitating the original MPC. Experiments show LaLQR's superior efficiency and generalization compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Is That Rain? Understanding Effects on Visual Odometry Performance for Autonomous UAVs and Efficient DNN-based Rain Classification at the Edge</title>

Abstract: The development of safe and reliable autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles relies on the ability of the system to recognise and adapt to changes in the local environment based on sensor inputs. State-of-the-art local tracking and trajectory planning are typically performed using camera sensor input to the flight control algorithm, but the extent to which environmental disturbances like rain affect the performance of these systems is largely unknown. In this paper, we first describe the development of an open dataset comprising ~335k images to examine these effects for seven different classes of precipitation conditions and show that a worst-case average tracking error of 1.5 m is possible for a state-of-the-art visual odometry system (VINS-Fusion). We then use the dataset to train a set of deep neural network models suited to mobile and constrained deployment scenarios to determine the extent to which it may be possible to efficiently and accurately classify these `rainy' conditions. The most lightweight of these models (MobileNetV3 small) can achieve an accuracy of 90% with a memory footprint of just 1.28 MB and a frame rate of 93 FPS, which is suitable for deployment in resource-constrained and latency-sensitive systems. We demonstrate a classification latency in the order of milliseconds using typical flight computer hardware. Accordingly, such a model can feed into the disturbance estimation component of an autonomous flight controller. In addition, data from unmanned aerial vehicles with the ability to accurately determine environmental conditions in real time may contribute to developing more granular timely localised weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Centralization vs. decentralization in multi-robot sweep coverage with ground robots and UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In swarm robotics, decentralized control is often proposed as a more scalable and fault-tolerant alternative to centralized control. However, centralized behaviors are often faster and more efficient than their decentralized counterparts. In any given application, the goals and constraints of the task being solved should guide the choice to use centralized control, decentralized control, or a combination of the two. Currently, the exact trade-offs that exist between centralization and decentralization are not well defined. In this paper, we study comparative performance assessment between centralization and decentralization in the example task of sweep coverage, across five different types of multi-robot control structures: random walk, decentralized with beacons, hybrid formation control using self-organizing hierarchy, centralized formation control, and predetermined. In all five approaches, the coverage task is completed by a group of ground robots. In each approach, except for the random walk, the ground robots are assisted by UAVs, acting as supervisors or beacons. We compare the approaches in terms of three performance metrics for which centralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- coverage completeness, coverage uniformity, and sweep completion time -- and two metrics for which decentralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- scalability (4, 8, or 16 ground robots) and fault tolerance (0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% ground robot failure). Finally, we discuss future work on combining the advantages of both in one system.</description>

      <title>Open-Nav: Exploring Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environment with Open-Source LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to follow textual instructions to navigate through 3D environments. Traditional approaches use supervised learning methods, relying heavily on domain-specific datasets to train VLN models. Recent methods try to utilize closed-source large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve VLN tasks in zero-shot manners, but face challenges related to expensive token costs and potential data breaches in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Open-Nav, a novel study that explores open-source LLMs for zero-shot VLN in the continuous environment. Open-Nav employs a spatial-temporal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning approach to break down tasks into instruction comprehension, progress estimation, and decision-making. It enhances scene perceptions with fine-grained object and spatial knowledge to improve LLM's reasoning in navigation. Our extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that Open-Nav achieves competitive performance compared to using closed-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Autonomous localization of multiple ionizing radiation sources using miniature single-layer Compton cameras onboard a group of micro aerial vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel method for autonomous localization of multiple sources of gamma radiation using a group of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is presented in this paper. The method utilizes an extremely lightweight (44 g) Compton camera MiniPIX TPX3. The compact size of the detector allows for deployment onboard safe and agile small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed radiation mapping approach fuses measurements from multiple distributed Compton camera sensors to accurately estimate the positions of multiple radioactive sources in real time. Unlike commonly used intensity-based detectors, the Compton camera reconstructs the set of possible directions towards a radiation source from just a single ionizing particle. Therefore, the proposed approach can localize radiation sources without having to estimate the gradient of a radiation field or contour lines, which require longer measurements. The instant estimation is able to fully exploit the potential of highly mobile MAVs. The radiation mapping method is combined with an active search strategy, which coordinates the future actions of the MAVs in order to improve the quality of the estimate of the sources' positions, as well as to explore the area of interest faster. The proposed solution is evaluated in simulation and real world experiments with multiple Cesium-137 radiation sources.</description>

      <title>VIP: Vision Instructed Pre-training for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of scaling up training data in robotic manipulation is still limited. A primary challenge in manipulation is the tasks are diverse, and the trained policy would be confused if the task targets are not specified clearly. Existing works primarily rely on text instruction to describe targets. However, we reveal that current robotic data cannot train policies to understand text instruction effectively, and vision is much more comprehensible. Therefore, we introduce utilizing vision instruction to specify targets. A straightforward implementation is training a policy to predict the intermediate actions linking the current observation and a future image. Nevertheless, a single future image does not describe the task target in insufficient detail. To handle this problem, we propose to use sparse point flows to provide more detailed information. Extensive tasks are designed based on real and simulated environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our vision instructed pre-training (VIP) method. The results indicate VIP improves the performance on diverse tasks significantly, and the derived policy can complete competitive tasks like ``opening the lid of a tightly sealed bottle''.</description>

      <title>Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>SAM2Act: Integrating Visual Foundation Model with A Memory Architecture for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems operating in diverse, dynamic environments must exhibit three critical abilities: multitask interaction, generalization to unseen scenarios, and spatial memory. While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves competitive performance on MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-enabled robotic systems.

      <title>From Foresight to Forethought: VLM-In-the-Loop Policy Steering via Latent Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in learning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit diverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

      <title>VolleyBots: A Testbed for Multi-Drone Volleyball Game Combining Motion Control and Strategic Play</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress, largely fueled by the development of specialized testbeds that enable systematic evaluation of algorithms in controlled yet challenging scenarios. However, existing testbeds often focus on purely virtual simulations or limited robot morphologies such as robotic arms, quadrupeds, and humanoids, leaving high-mobility platforms with real-world physical constraints like drones underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present VolleyBots, a new MARL testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots features a turn-based interaction model under volleyball rules, a hierarchical decision-making process that combines motion control and strategic play, and a high-fidelity simulation for seamless sim-to-real transfer. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative MARL and game-theoretic algorithms. Results in simulation show that while existing algorithms handle simple tasks effectively, they encounter difficulty in complex tasks that require both low-level control and high-level strategy. We further demonstrate zero-shot deployment of a simulation-learned policy to real-world drones, highlighting VolleyBots' potential to propel MARL research involving agile robotic platforms.

      <description>arXiv:2502.03729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end imitation learning offers a promising approach for training robot policies. However, generalizing to new settings remains a significant challenge. Although large-scale robot demonstration datasets have shown potential for inducing generalization, they are resource-intensive to scale. In contrast, human video data is abundant and diverse, presenting an attractive alternative. Yet, these human-video datasets lack action labels, complicating their use in imitation learning. Existing methods attempt to extract grounded action representations (e.g., hand poses), but resulting policies struggle to bridge the embodiment gap between human and robot actions. We propose an alternative approach: leveraging language-based reasoning from human videos-essential for guiding robot actions-to train generalizable robot policies. Building on recent advances in reasoning-based policy architectures, we introduce Reasoning through Action-free Data (RAD). RAD learns from both robot demonstration data (with reasoning and action labels) and action-free human video data (with only reasoning labels). The robot data teaches the model to map reasoning to low-level actions, while the action-free data enhances reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we will release a new dataset of 3,377 human-hand demonstrations with reasoning annotations compatible with the Bridge V2 benchmark and aimed at facilitating future research on reasoning-driven robot learning. Our experiments show that RAD enables effective transfer across the embodiment gap, allowing robots to perform tasks seen only in action-free data. Furthermore, scaling up action-free reasoning data significantly improves policy performance and generalization to novel tasks. These results highlight the promise of reasoning-driven learning from action-free datasets for advancing generalizable robot control. Project page: https://rad-generalization.github.io</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in Multi-Robot Systems (MRS), enabling enhanced communication, task planning, and human-robot interaction. Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source Github repository.</description>

      <title>HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

      <description>arXiv:2502.05728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in hierarchical policy learning highlight the advantages of decomposing systems into high-level and low-level agents, enabling efficient long-horizon reasoning and precise fine-grained control. However, the interface between these hierarchy levels remains underexplored, and existing hierarchical methods often ignore domain symmetry, resulting in the need for extensive demonstrations to achieve robust performance. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Equivariant Policy (HEP), a novel hierarchical policy framework. We propose a frame transfer interface for hierarchical policy learning, which uses the high-level agent's output as a coordinate frame for the low-level agent, providing a strong inductive bias while retaining flexibility. Additionally, we integrate domain symmetries into both levels and theoretically demonstrate the system's overall equivariance. HEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both simulation and real-world settings.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous driving is a challenging task that has gained broad attention from both academia and industry. Current solutions using convolutional neural networks require large amounts of computational resources, leading to high power consumption. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an alternative computational model to process information and make decisions. This biologically plausible model has the advantage of low latency and energy efficiency. Recent work using SNNs for autonomous driving mostly focused on simple tasks like lane keeping in simplified simulation environments. This paper studies SNNs on photo-realistic driving scenes in the CARLA simulator, which is an important step toward using SNNs on real vehicles. The efficacy and generalizability of the method will be investigated.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detection in Foundation Models for Decision-Making: A Flexible Definition and Review of the State of the Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16527</link>

Abstract: Autonomous systems are soon to be ubiquitous, spanning manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, entertainment, and other industries. Most of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these approaches perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets has led researchers to believe that these models may provide "common sense" reasoning that existing planners are missing, bridging the gap between algorithm development and deployment. While researchers have shown promising results in deploying foundation models to decision-making tasks, these models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, present guidelines, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.</description>

      <title>Towards Single-Lens Controllable Depth-of-Field Imaging via Depth-Aware Point Spread Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable Depth-of-Field (DoF) imaging commonly produces amazing visual effects based on heavy and expensive high-end lenses. However, confronted with the increasing demand for mobile scenarios, it is desirable to achieve a lightweight solution with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS). This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable DoF, for achieving single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods. A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-wise convolution. To address the depth-varying optical degradation, we introduce a Depth-aware Degradation-adaptive Training (DA2T) scheme. At the dataset level, a Depth-aware Aberration MOS (DAMOS) dataset is established based on the simulation of Point Spread Functions (PSFs) under different object distances. Additionally, we design two plug-and-play depth-aware mechanisms to embed depth information into the aberration image recovery for better tackling depth-aware degradation. Furthermore, we propose a storage-efficient Omni-Lens-Field model to represent the 4D PSF library of various lenses. With the predicted depth map, recovered image, and depth-aware PSF map inferred by Omni-Lens-Field, single-lens controllable DoF imaging is achieved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the recovery performance, and attains impressive single-lens controllable DoF imaging results, providing a seminal baseline for this field. The source code and the established dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DCDI.</description>

      <title>Learning from Demonstration with Implicit Nonlinear Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies that solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in robotic manipulation. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires overcoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of drift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent out-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem through scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a human-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning a dynamical system model with convergence guarantees. In this work, we propose and validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by reservoir computing, we develop a recurrent neural network layer that includes a fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties for modelling temporal dynamics. We validate the efficacy of our neural network layer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human Handwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that incorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses the issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative evaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy predictions and an Echo State Network (ESN) implementation. We find that our approach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task while also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining competitive latency scores.</description>

      <title>Effect of Adaptive Communication Support on LLM-powered Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration requires robot to adopt their roles and levels of support based on human needs, task requirements, and complexity. Traditional human-robot teaming often relies on a pre-determined robot communication scheme, restricting teamwork adaptability in complex tasks. Leveraging strong communication capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a Human-Robot Teaming Framework with Multi-Modal Language feedback (HRT-ML), a framework designed to enhance human-robot interaction by adjusting the frequency and content of language-based feedback. HRT-ML framework includes two core modules: a Coordinator for high-level, low-frequency strategic guidance, and a Manager for subtask-specific, high-frequency instructions, enabling passive and active interactions with human teammates. To assess the impact of language feedback in collaborative scenarios, we conducted experiments in an enhanced Overcooked environment with varying levels of task complexity (easy, medium, hard) and feedback frequency (inactive, passive, active, superactive). Our results show that as task complexity increases relative to human capabilities, human teammates exhibited a stronger preference towards robotic agents that can offer frequent, proactive support. However, when task complexities exceed the LLM's capacity, noisy and inaccurate feedback from superactive robotic agents can instead hinder team performance, as it requires human teammates to increase their effort to interpret and respond to a large number of communications, with limited performance return. Our results offer a general principle for robotic agents to dynamically adjust their levels and frequencies of communications to work seamlessly with humans and achieve improved teaming performance.</description>
