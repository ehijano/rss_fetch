      <title>Spherical quasi-interpolation using scaled zonal kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a new quasi-interpolation method on spheres featuring the following two-phase construction and analysis. In Phase I, we analyze and characterize a large family of zonal kernels (e.g., the spherical version of Poisson kernel, Gaussian, compactly-supported radial kernels), so that the underlying spherical convolution operators (upon the introduction of a scaling parameter) attains a high-order of approximation to target functions. In Phase II, we discretize the spherical integrals utilizing quadrature rules of optimal order to produce the final quasi-interpolants. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new quasi-interpolation algorithm is robust and amenable to integrated as well as distributed ways of implementation. Moreover, the underlying error-analysis shows that by fine-tuning the scaling parameter in the radial kernels employed, the resulting quasi-interpolants achieve a well-balanced trade-off between approximation and sampling errors.</description>

      <title>Trefftz Discontinuous Galerkin approximation of an acoustic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified Trefftz Discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method for approximating a time-harmonic acoustic scattering problem in an infinitely elongated waveguide. In the waveguide we suppose there is a bounded, penetrable and possibly absorbing scatterer. The classical TDG is not applicable to this important case. Novel features of our modified TDG method are that it is applicable when the scatterer is absorbing, and it uses a stable treatment of the asymptotic radiation condition for the scattered field. For the modified TDG, we prove $h$ and $p$-convergence in the $L^2$ norm. The theoretical results are verified numerically for a discretization based on plane waves (that may be evanescent in the scatterer).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider effective discretization strategies and iterative solvers for nonlinear PDE-constrained optimization models for pattern evolution within biological processes. Upon a Sequential Quadratic Programming linearization of the optimization problem, we devise appropriate time-stepping schemes and discrete approximations of the cost functionals such that the discretization and optimization operations are commutative, a highly desirable property of a discretization of such problems. We formulate the large-scale, coupled linear systems in such a way that efficient preconditioned iterative methods can be applied within a Krylov subspace solver. Numerical experiments demonstrate the viability and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Mesh Construction for the Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations with Markovian Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an approach to the numerical solution of nonlinear stochastic differential equations with Markovian switching. Such equations describe the stochastic dynamics of processes where the drift and diffusion coefficients are subject to random state changes according to a Markov chain with finite state space. We propose a variant of the Jump Adapted-Adaptive approach introduced by K, Lord, \&amp; Sun~(2025) to construct nonuniform meshes for explicit numerical schemes that adjust timesteps locally to rapid changes in the numerical solution and which also incorporate the switching times of an underlying Markov chain as meshpoints. It is shown that a hybrid scheme using such a mesh that combines an efficient explicit method (to be used frequently) and a potentially inefficient backstop method (to be used occasionally) will display strong convergence in mean-square of order $\delta$ if both methods satisfy a mean-square consistency condition of the same order in the absence of switching. We demonstrate the construction of an order $\delta=1$ method of this type and apply it to generate empirical distributions of a nonlinear SDE model of telomere length in DNA replication.</description>

      <title>Original energy dissipation preserving corrections of integrating factor Runge-Kutta methods for gradient flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit integrating factor Runge-Kutta methods are attractive and popular in developing high-order maximum bound principle preserving time-stepping schemes for Allen-Cahn type gradient flows. However, they always suffer from the non-preservation of steady-state solution and original energy dissipation law. To overcome these disadvantages, some new integrating factor methods are developed by using two classes of difference correction, including the telescopic correction and nonlinear-term translation correction, enforcing the preservation of steady-state solution. Then the original energy dissipation properties of the new methods are examined by using the associated differential forms and the differentiation matrices. As applications, some new integrating factor Runge-Kutta methods up to third-order maintaining the original energy dissipation law are constructed by applying the difference correction strategies to some popular explicit integrating factor methods in the literature. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to support our theory and to demonstrate the improved performance of new methods.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow-based modularity maximization for community detection in multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two methods for the unsupervised detection of communities in undirected multiplex networks. These networks consist of multiple layers that record different relationships between the same entities or incorporate data from different sources. Both methods are formulated as gradient flows of suitable energy functionals: the first (MPBTV) builds on the minimization of a balanced total variation functional, which we show to be equivalent to multiplex modularity maximization, while the second (DGFM3) directly maximizes multiplex modularity. The resulting non-linear matrix-valued ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved efficiently by a graph Merriman--Bence--Osher (MBO) scheme. Key to the efficiency is the approximate integration of the discrete linear differential operators by truncated eigendecompositions in the matrix exponential function. Numerical experiments on several real-world multiplex networks show that our methods are competitive with the state of the art with respect to various metrics. Their major benefit is a significant reduction of computational complexity leading to runtimes that are orders of magnitude faster for large multiplex networks.</description>

      <title>On latent dynamics learning in nonlinear reduced order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the novel mathematical framework of latent dynamics models (LDMs) for reduced order modeling of parameterized nonlinear time-dependent PDEs. Our framework casts this latter task as a nonlinear dimensionality reduction problem, while constraining the latent state to evolve accordingly to an (unknown) dynamical system. A time-continuous setting is employed to derive error and stability estimates for the LDM approximation of the full order model (FOM) solution. We analyze the impact of using an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in the time-discrete setting, resulting in the $\Delta\text{LDM}$ formulation, and further explore the learnable setting, $\Delta\text{LDM}_\theta$, where deep neural networks approximate the discrete LDM components, while providing a bounded approximation error with respect to the FOM. Moreover, we extend the concept of parameterized Neural ODE - recently proposed as a possible way to build data-driven dynamical systems with varying input parameters - to be a convolutional architecture, where the input parameters information is injected by means of an affine modulation mechanism, while designing a convolutional autoencoder neural network able to retain spatial-coherence, thus enhancing interpretability at the latent level. Numerical experiments, including the Burgers' and the advection-reaction-diffusion equations, demonstrate the framework's ability to obtain, in a multi-query context, a time-continuous approximation of the FOM solution, thus being able to query the LDM approximation at any given time instance while retaining a prescribed level of accuracy. Our findings highlight the remarkable potential of the proposed LDMs, representing a mathematically rigorous framework to enhance the accuracy and approximation capabilities of reduced order modeling for time-dependent parameterized PDEs.</description>

      <title>Automated Synthesis of Quantum Algorithms via Classical Numerical Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply numerical optimization and linear algebra algorithms for classical computers to the problem of automatically synthesizing algorithms for quantum computers. Using our framework, we apply several common techniques from these classical domains and numerically examine their suitability for and performance on this problem. Our methods are evaluated on single-qubit systems as well as on larger systems. While the first part of our proposed method outputs a single unitary matrix representing the composite effects of a quantum circuit or algorithm, we use existing tools - and assess the performance of these - to factor such a matrix into a product of elementary quantum gates. This enables our pipeline to be truly end-to-end: starting from desired input/output examples, our code ultimately results in a quantum circuit diagram. We release our code to the research community (upon acceptance).</description>

Abstract: We detail a numerical algorithm and related code to construct rational quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere that satisfy the Boutroux condition. These differentials, in special cases, provide solutions of (generalized) Chebotarov problem as well as being instances of Jenkins--Strebel differentials. The algorithm allows to construct Boutroux differentials with prescribed polar part, thus being useful in the theory of weighted capacity and Random Matrices.</description>

      <title>General-Kindred Physics-Informed Neural Network to the Solutions of Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a promising research direction in the field of solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Dealing with singular perturbation problems continues to be a difficult challenge in the field of PINN. The solution of singular perturbation problems often exhibits sharp boundary layers and steep gradients, and traditional PINN cannot achieve approximation of boundary layers. In this manuscript, we propose the General-Kindred Physics-Informed Neural Network (GKPINN) for solving Singular Perturbation Differential Equations (SPDEs). This approach utilizes asymptotic analysis to acquire prior knowledge of the boundary layer from the equation and establishes a novel network to assist PINN in approximating the boundary layer. It is compared with traditional PINN by solving examples of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and time-varying SPDE equations. The research findings underscore the exceptional performance of our novel approach, GKPINN, which delivers a remarkable enhancement in reducing the $L_2$ error by two to four orders of magnitude compared to the established PINN methodology. This significant improvement is accompanied by a substantial acceleration in convergence rates, without compromising the high precision that is critical for our applications. Furthermore, GKPINN still performs well in extreme cases with perturbation parameters of ${1\times10}^{-38}$, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Robo-GS: A Physics Consistent Spatial-Temporal Model for Robotic Arm with Hybrid Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real2Sim2Real plays a critical role in robotic arm control and reinforcement learning, yet bridging this gap remains a significant challenge due to the complex physical properties of robots and the objects they manipulate. Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes.
  We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms.
  This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods.

      <title>Simulation of Stochastic Discrete Dislocation Dynamics in Ductile Vs Brittle Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects are inevitable during the manufacturing processes of materials. Presence of these defects and their dynamics significantly influence the responses of materials. A thorough understanding of dislocation dynamics of different types of materials under various conditions is essential for analyzing the performance of the materials. Ductility of a material is directly related with the movement and rearrangement of dislocations under applied load. In this work, we look into the dynamics of dislocations in ductile and brittle materials using simplified two dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (2D-DDD) simulation. We consider Aluminium (Al) and Tungsten (W) as representative examples of ductile and brittle materials respectively. We study the velocity distribution, strain field, dislocation count, and junction formation during interactions of the dislocations within the domain. Furthermore, we study the probability densities of dislocation motion for both materials. In mesoscale, moving dislocations can be considered as particle diffusionm, which are often stochastic and super-diffusive. Classical diffusion models fail to account for these phenomena and the long-range interactions of dislocations. Therefore, we propose the nonlocal transport model for the probability density and obtained the parameters of nonlocal operators using a machine learning framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.12417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a formal expansion of multiple relaxation times lattice Boltzmann schemes in terms of a single infinitesimal numerical variable. The result is a system of partial differential equations for the conserved moments of the lattice Boltzmann scheme. The expansion is presented  in the nonlinear case up to fourth order accuracy. The asymptotic corrections of  the nonconserved moments  are developed in terms of  equilibrium values and  partial differentials of the conserved moments. Both expansions are coupled and conduct to explicit compact formulas. The new algebraic expressions are validated with previous results obtained with this approach. The example of isothermal D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann scheme illustrates the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic analysis towards time-domain extended source waveform inversion</title>

Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) updates the subsurface model from an initial model by comparing observed and synthetic seismograms. Due to high nonlinearity, FWI is easy to be trapped into local minima. Extended domain FWI, including wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) and extended source waveform inversion (ESI) are attractive options to mitigate this issue. This paper makes an in-depth analysis for FWI in the extended domain, identifying key challenges and searching for potential remedies towards practical applications. WRI and ESI are formulated within the same mathematical framework using Lagrangian-based adjoint-state method with a special focus on time-domain formulation using extended sources, while putting connections between classical FWI, WRI and ESI: both WRI and ESI can be viewed as weighted versions of classic FWI. Due to symmetric positive definite Hessian, the conjugate gradient is explored to efficiently solve the normal equation in a matrix free manner, while both time and frequency domain wave equation solvers are feasible. This study finds that the most significant challenge comes from the huge storage demand to store time-domain wavefields through iterations. To resolve this challenge, two possible workaround strategies can be considered, i.e., by extracting sparse frequencial wavefields or by considering time-domain data instead of wavefields for reducing such challenge. We suggest that these options should be explored more intensively for tractable workflows.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Controlled Schemes for the Eigenvalue Problem of the Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The criticality problem in nuclear engineering asks for the principal eigen-pair of a Boltzmann operator describing neutron transport in a reactor core. Being able to reliably design, and control such reactors requires assessing these quantities within quantifiable accuracy tolerances. In this paper we propose a paradigm that deviates from the common practice of approximately solving the corresponding spectral problem with a fixed, presumably sufficiently fine discretization. Instead, the present approach is based on first contriving iterative schemes, formulated in function space, that are shown to converge at a quantitative rate without assuming any a priori excess regularity properties, and that exploit only properties of the optical parameters in the underlying radiative transfer model. We develop the analytical and numerical tools for approximately realizing each iteration step withing judiciously chosen accuracy tolerances, verified by a posteriori estimates, so as to still warrant quantifiable convergence to the exact eigen-pair. This is carried out in full first for a Newton scheme. Since this is only locally convergent we analyze in addition the convergence of a power iteration in function space to produce sufficiently accurate initial guesses. Here we have to deal with intrinsic difficulties posed by compact but unsymmetric operators preventing standard arguments used in the finite dimensional case. Our main point is that we can avoid any condition on an initial guess to be already in a small neighborhood of the exact solution. We close with a discussion of remaining intrinsic obstructions to a certifiable numerical implementation, mainly related to not knowing the gap between the principal eigenvalue and the next smaller one in modulus.</description>

      <title>On optimality conditions for multivariate Chebyshev approximation and convex optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review state-of-the-art optimality conditions of multivariate Chebyshev approximation, including, from oldest to newest, Kirchberger's kernel condition, Kolmogorov criteria, Rivlin and Shapiro's annihilating measures. These conditions are then re-interpreted using the optimality conditions of convex optimization, subdifferential and directional derivative. Finally, this new point of view is used to derive new optimality conditions for the following problems: First for the multivariate Chebyshev approximation with a weight function. Second, the approximation problem proposed by Arzelier, Br ehard and Joldes (26th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic 2019) consisting in minimizing the sum of both the polynomial approximation error and the first order approximation of the worst case evaluation error of the polynomial in Horner form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show how to construct a numerical method for solving hyperbolic problems, whether linear or nonlinear, using a continuous representation of the variables and their mean value in each triangular element. This type of approach has already been introduced by Roe, and others, in the multidimensional framework under the name of Active flux, see \cite{AF1,AF2,AF3,AF4,AF5}. Here, the presentation is more general and follows \cite{Abgrall_AF,BarzukowAbgrall}. { Various} examples show the good behavior of the method in both linear and nonlinear cases, including non-convex problems. The expected order of precision is obtained in both the linear and nonlinear cases. This work represents a step towards the development of methods in the spirit of virtual finite elements for linear or nonlinear hyperbolic problems, including the case where the solution is not regular.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of a discretization of dynamic optimal transport using the dual formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a discretization of the dynamic optimal transport problem for which we can obtain the convergence rate for the value of the transport cost to its continuous value when the temporal and spatial stepsize vanish. This convergence result does not require any regularity assumption on the measures, though experiments suggest that the rate is not sharp. Via an analysis of the duality gap we also obtain the convergence rates for the gradient of the optimal potentials and the velocity field under mild regularity assumptions. To obtain such rates, we discretize the dual formulation of the dynamic optimal transport problem and use the mature literature related to the error due to discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a near-optimality guarantee for the full orthogonalization method (FOM), showing that the overall convergence of FOM is nearly as good as GMRES. In particular, we prove that at every iteration $k$, there exists an iteration $j\leq k$ for which the FOM residual norm at iteration $j$ is no more than $\sqrt{k+1}$ times larger than the GMRES residual norm at iteration $k$. This bound is sharp, and it has implications for algorithms for approximating the action of a matrix function on a vector.\end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Adaptive resolution of fine scales in modes of microstructured optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adaptive algorithm for computing eigenmodes and propagation constants of optical fibers is proposed. The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross-section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.</description>

      <title>Iterative Refinement with Low-Precision Posits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research investigates using a mixed-precision iterative refinement method using posit numbers instead of the standard IEEE floating-point format. The method is applied to solve a general linear system represented by the equation $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a large sparse matrix. Various scaling techniques, such as row and column equilibration, map the matrix entries to higher-density regions of machine numbers before performing the $O(n^3)$ factorization operation. Low-precision LU factorization followed by forward/backward substitution provides an initial estimate. The results demonstrate that a 16-bit posit configuration combined with equilibration produces accuracy comparable to IEEE half-precision (fp16), indicating a potential for achieving a balance between efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum (on Dowker's sum of order one half)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the finite trigonometric sum $\sum a_l\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$, where $a_l$ are equal to $\cos(2\pi l \nu/n)$ and where the summation index $l$ and the discrete parameter $\nu$ both run through $1$ to $n-1$. This sum is a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum, which has been extensively studied in a series of previous papers, and also may be regarded as the so-called Dowker sum of order one half. It occurs in various problems in mathematics, physics and engineering, and plays an important role in some number-theoretic problems. In the paper, we obtain several integral and series representations for the above-mentioned sum, investigate its properties, derive various, including asymptotic, expansions for it, and deduce very accurate upper and lower bounds for it (both bounds are asymptotically vanishing). In addition, we obtain two relatively simple approximate formulae containing only several terms, which are also very accurate and can be particularly appreciated in applications. Finally, we also derive several advanced summation formulae for the digamma functions, which relate the gamma and the digamma functions, the investigated sum, as well as the product of a sequence of cosecants $\prod\big(\csc(\pi l/n)\big)^{\csc(\pi l/n)}$</description>

      <title>Consistent machine learning for topology optimization with microstructure-dependent neural network material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing methods together with topology optimization have enabled the creation of multiscale structures with controlled spatially-varying material microstructure. However, topology optimization or inverse design of such structures in the presence of nonlinearities remains a challenge due to the expense of computational homogenization methods and the complexity of differentiably parameterizing the microstructural response. A solution to this challenge lies in machine learning techniques that offer efficient, differentiable mappings between the material response and its microstructural descriptors. This work presents a framework for designing multiscale heterogeneous structures with spatially varying microstructures by merging a homogenization-based topology optimization strategy with a consistent machine learning approach grounded in hyperelasticity theory. We leverage neural architectures that adhere to critical physical principles such as polyconvexity, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency to supply the framework with a reliable constitutive model that is dependent on material microstructural descriptors. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating consistent machine learning models with density-based topology optimization for enhancing design optimization of heterogeneous hyperelastic structures under finite deformations.</description>

      <title>A Derivative-Free Martingale Neural Network Soc-Martnet For The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations In Stochastic Optimal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient derivative-free version of a martingale neural network SOC-MartNet proposed in Cai et al. [2] for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs) with controls on both drift and volatility. The solution of the HJB equation consists of two steps: (1) finding the optimal control from the value function, and (2) deriving the value function from a linear PDE characterized by the optimal control. The linear PDE is reformulated into a weak form of a new martingale formulation from the original SOC-MartNet where all temporal and spatial derivatives are replaced by an univariate, first-order random finite difference operator approximation, giving the derivative free version of the SOC-MartNet. Then, the optimal feedback control is identified by minimizing the mean of the value function, thereby avoiding the need for pointwise minimization on the Hamiltonian. Finally, the optimal control and value function are approximated by neural networks trained via adversarial learning using the derivative-free formulation. This method eliminates the reliance on automatic differentiation for computing temporal and spatial derivatives, offering significant efficiency in solving high-dimensional HJB equations and SOCPs.</description>
