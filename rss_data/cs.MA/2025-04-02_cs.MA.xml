      <title>An Agent-based Model Simulation Approach to Demonstrate Effects of Aging Population and Social Service Policies on Pensions Fund and Its Long-term Socio-economic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a powerful tool in social policy-making and socio-economics, offering a flexible and dynamic approach to understanding and simulating complex systems. While traditional analytic methods may be less effective in unpredictable situations, ABM can provide valuable support for policy-making by generating large ensembles of scenarios and evaluating adaptive policies. This approach has been applied in various fields, including economics, management, sociology, and politics, and has the potential to deepen our understanding of economic policy in the cooperative sector.</description>

      <title>Remember, but also, Forget: Bridging Myopic and Perfect Recall Fairness with Past-Discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in multi-agent settings often requires balancing efficiency with fairness over time--a challenge inadequately addressed by conventional, myopic fairness measures. Motivated by behavioral insights that human judgments of fairness evolve with temporal distance, we introduce a novel framework for temporal fairness that incorporates past-discounting mechanisms. By applying a tunable discount factor to historical utilities, our approach interpolates between instantaneous and perfect-recall fairness, thereby capturing both immediate outcomes and long-term equity considerations. Beyond aligning more closely with human perceptions of fairness, this past-discounting method ensures that the augmented state space remains bounded, significantly improving computational tractability in sequential decision-making settings. We detail the formulation of discounted-recall fairness in both additive and averaged utility contexts, illustrate its benefits through practical examples, and discuss its implications for designing balanced, scalable resource allocation strategies.</description>

      <title>Sky of Unlearning (SoUL): Rewiring Federated Machine Unlearning via Selective Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Drones (IoD), where drones collaborate in data collection and analysis, has become essential for applications such as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Federated learning (FL) enables drones to train machine learning models in a decentralized manner while preserving data privacy. However, FL in IoD networks is susceptible to attacks like data poisoning and model inversion. Federated unlearning (FU) mitigates these risks by eliminating adversarial data contributions, preventing their influence on the model. This paper proposes sky of unlearning (SoUL), a federated unlearning framework that efficiently removes the influence of unlearned data while maintaining model performance. A selective pruning algorithm is designed to identify and remove neurons influential in unlearning but minimally impact the overall performance of the model. Simulations demonstrate that SoUL outperforms existing unlearning methods, achieves accuracy comparable to full retraining, and reduces computation and communication overhead, making it a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained IoD networks.</description>

      <title>Can A Society of Generative Agents Simulate Human Behavior and Inform Public Health Policy? A Case Study on Vaccine Hesitancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can we simulate a sandbox society with generative agents to model human behavior, thereby reducing the over-reliance on real human trials for assessing public policies? In this work, we investigate the feasibility of simulating health-related decision-making, using vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services (MacDonald, 2015), as a case study. To this end, we introduce the VacSim framework with 100 generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VacSim simulates vaccine policy outcomes with the following steps: 1) instantiate a population of agents with demographics based on census data; 2) connect the agents via a social network and model vaccine attitudes as a function of social dynamics and disease-related information; 3) design and evaluate various public health interventions aimed at mitigating vaccine hesitancy. To align with real-world results, we also introduce simulation warmup and attitude modulation to adjust agents' attitudes. We propose a series of evaluations to assess the reliability of various LLM simulations. Experiments indicate that models like Llama and Qwen can simulate aspects of human behavior but also highlight real-world alignment challenges, such as inconsistent responses with demographic profiles. This early exploration of LLM-driven simulations is not meant to serve as definitive policy guidance; instead, it serves as a call for action to examine social simulation for policy development.</description>
