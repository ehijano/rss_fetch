      <title>Softly $\pi g\hat{D}$-Normal Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a new class of softly normal called softly $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normality by using $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -open sets and obtained several properties of such a space. We discuss many properties of this new space and we give some properties that connect this new spaces with some other topological spaces, also we present some examples and counter examples that show the relationships between softly $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normal spaces and some other topological spaces, also we introduced the concept of $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normal, almost $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normal, quasi $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normal, mildly $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normal. The main result of this paper is that softly $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normality is a topological property and it is a hereditary property with respect to closed domain subspaces. Moreover, we obtain some new characterizations and preservation theorems of softly $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normal spaces. We insure that existence of utility for new results of softly $\pi g\widehat{D}$ -normality using separation axioms in topological spaces which is separate on a known separation axioms in topological spaces.</description>

      <title>On ideals of product of commutative rings and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, leveraging the recent achievements of researchers, we have revisited the family of ideals of product of commutative rings. We demonstrate that if $ \{ R_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in A} $ is an infinite family of rings, then $ \left| Max \left( \prod_{\alpha \in A} R_\alpha \right) \right| \geqslant 2^{2^{|A|}} $. Notably, if these rings are local then the equality holds. We establish that $ Max(R_\alpha) $ is homeomorphic to a closed subset of $ Max \left( \prod_{\alpha \in A} R_\alpha \right) $, for each $ \alpha \in A $. Additionally, we show that $ Max(R) $ is disconnected \ff $ R $ is direct summand of its two proper ideals. We deduce that if the intersection of each infinite family of maximal ideals of a ring is zero, then the ring is not direct summand of its two proper ideals. Furthermore, we prove that for each ring $R$, $ C\left(Max(R)\right) $ is isomorphic to $ C\left(Max\left(C(Y)\right)\right) $, for some compact $T_4$ space $Y$. Finally, we explore that $h_M(x)$'s can define roles of zero-sets.</description>

      <title>Discrete Microlocal Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish several results combining discrete Morse theory and microlocal sheaf theory in the setting of finite posets and simplicial complexes. Our primary tool is a computationally tractable description of the bounded derived category of sheaves on a poset with the Alexandrov topology. We prove that each bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset admits a unique (up to isomorphism of complexes) minimal injective resolution, and we provide algorithms for computing minimal injective resolution of an injective complex, as well as several useful functors between derived categories of sheaves. For the constant sheaf on a simplicial complex, we give asymptotically tight bounds on the complexity of computing the minimal injective resolution using those algorithms. Our main result is a novel definition of the discrete microsupport of a bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset. We detail several foundational properties of the discrete microsupport, as well as a microlocal generalization of the discrete homological Morse theorem and Morse inequalities.</description>
