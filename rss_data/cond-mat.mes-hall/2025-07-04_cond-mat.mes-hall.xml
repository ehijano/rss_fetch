      <title>Nano-optomechanical exploration of the dynamical photothermal response of suspended nanowires to laser-induced thermal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal and photothermal effects play an increasing role at the nanoscale due to the general decrease of thermal conductances and to the increasing role of interfaces. Here we present a non-contact optomechanical analysis of the thermal and photothermal properties of suspended nanowires based on pump-probe response measurements: a probe laser measures the nanowire deformations and property changes caused by an intensity-modulated pump laser launching thermal waves propagating along the 1D conductor. The analysis of the dominant photothermal contributions to the nanowires response in the spectral and spatial domains allows in particular to quantify the interfacial contact resistance, to detect its internal optical resonances and to image absorption inhomogeneities. Additionally, by exploiting the temperature-induced optical reflectivity changes of the nanowire, we directly image the spatial structure of the thermal waves propagating within the nanowire. Finally we investigate how those thermal waves are responsible for a dynamical modulation of the nanowire vibration frequency, in the resolved sideband regime, providing novel analytical tools to further inspect the structural properties of nano-optomechanical systems with a large signal to noise ratio. Those methods are generic and critical to correctly understand the photothermal dynamical back action processes and improve the intrinsic sensitivity of those ultrasensitive force probes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry in the NbSe$_2$ Family I: Obstructed Compact Wannier Function and New Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer 1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94% accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Andreev Conversion in Graphene Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency (well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result, interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is considerably more robust.</description>

      <title>Coercivity-size map of magnetic nanoflowers: spin disorder tunes the vortex reversal mechanism and tailors the hyperthermia sweet spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron-oxide nanoflowers (NFs) are one of the most efficient nanoheaters for magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT). However, the physics underlying the spin texture of disordered iron-oxide nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit remains still poorly understood. Using large-scale micromagnetic simulations we completely map the magnetization of NFs over an unprecedented size range, from 10 to 400 nm in diameter, connecting their microstructure to their macroscopic magnetic response. Above the single domain (d &gt; 50 nm), the magnetization folds into a vortex state, within which the coercivity describes a secondary maximum, not present for non-disordered nanoparticles. We have extended our understanding by resolving also the NF magnetization dynamics, capturing the physics of the magnetization reversal. Within the vortex regime, two distinct reversal modes exist: i) A core-dominated one, in which the core immediately switches along the direction of the applied field, resulting in an increasing coercivity for larger sizes; and ii) a flux-closure dominated reversal mode, going through the perpendicular alignment of the vortex core to the field, resulting in a decreasing coercivity-size dependence. The coercivity maximum is located at the transition between both reversal modes, and results from the combination of grain anisotropy and grain-boundary pinning: weak (but non-negligible) inter-grain exchange keeps the vortex profile coherent, yet allows the core to be pinned by the random anisotropy easy axes of the single grains, maximizing magnetic losses. Our results provide the first full description of spin textures in iron oxide NFs beyond the macrospin framework, and clarify the role of internal spin disorder in magnetic hyperthermia heating. By adjusting the grain size, the coercivity "sweet spot" can be tailored, offering a practical route to next-generation, high-efficiency nanoheaters.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of quantum coherence in solid-state qubits via interface engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising quantum sensors but suffer from noise-induced short coherence times due to bulk and surface impurities. We present interfacial engineering via oxygen termination and graphene patching, extending shallow NV coherence to over 1 ms, approaching the T1 limit. Raman spectroscopy and density-functional theory reveal surface termination-driven graphene charge transfer reduces spin noise by pairing surface electrons, supported by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy showing fewer unpaired spins. Enhanced sensitivity enables detection of single weakly coupled 13C nuclear spins and external 11B spins from a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layer, achieving nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. A protective h-BN top layer stabilizes the platform, ensuring robustness against harsh treatments and compatibility with target materials. This integrated approach advances practical quantum sensing by combining extended coherence, improved sensitivity, and device durability.</description>

      <title>Generation of a single-cycle surface acoustic wave pulse on LiNbO$_3$ for application to thin film materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology has been explored in thin-film materials to discover fundamental phenomena and to investigate their physical properties. It is used to excite and manipulate quasi-particles such as phonons or magnons, and can dynamically modulate the properties of the materials. In the field, SAWs are typically excited by a continuous wave at a resonant frequency. Recently, generation of a single-cycle SAW pulse has been demonstrated on GaAs substrate. Such a SAW pulse provides a potential to access a single quasi-particle excitation and to investigate its dynamics by time-resolved measurements. On the other hand, to modulate and control the properties of thin film materials, it is generally required to generate high-intensity SAWs. In this work, we demonstrate the efficient generation of a SAW pulse using a chirp interdigital transducer (IDT) on LiNbO$_3$ substrate. We have fabricated chirp IDT devices with bandwidths from 0.5 GHz to 5.5 GHz. We also confirmed the generation of a SAW pulse with 0.3 ns FWHM (full width at half maximum) by performing time-resolved measurements. The conversion efficiency between input power and SAW on LiNbO$_3$ substrate is approximately 45 times larger than that on GaAs substrate. This enables us to generate a high-intensity SAW pulse, meeting the requirement for the modulation of thin films. Our results will expand the research in the field, such as spintronics and magnonics, and lead to their further advancements.</description>

      <title>Observation of terahertz spin-Hall magnetoresistance in insulating magnet YIG/Pt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in prototypical bilayers of ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and platinum in the frequency range from 0 THz to as high as 1.5 THz. The spectral composition of the effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior, decreasing by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishing entirely at 1.5 THz. Using a dynamic magnetoresistive model, we can fully explain the spectral dependence by competition of transverse spin-torque (coherent) and longitudinal (incoherent) contributions to the spin current and their characteristic response times. Our analysis suggests that the slow dissipation of incoherent magnons from the interface is the limiting process responsible for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe of ultrafast interfacial spin-magnon coupling.</description>

      <title>Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Single Photon Emitters in Ultra-Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPE) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising for applications ranging from single-photon sources to quantum sensors. Previous studies exclusively focused on the generation and characterization of SPEs in relatively thick h-BN layers ($\geq$ 30 nm). However, for electrical and magnetic sensing applications, the thickness of the h-BN limits the attainable spatial resolution. Here, we report the observation of blue-wavelength emitters (B-centers) activated by electron beam irradiation in ultra-thin ($\simeq$ 3 nm) h-BN. These SPEs in ultra-thin flakes exhibit reduced brightness, broader zero-phonon line, and enhanced photobleaching. Remarkably, upon encapsulation in thicker h-BN, we restore their brightness, narrow linewidth 230$\mu$eV at 5K, resolution limited), suppress photobleaching, and confirm single-photon emission with $ g^{(2)}(0) &lt; 0.4$ at room temperature. The possibility of generating SPEs in a few-layer h-BN and their subsequent incorporation into a van der Waals heterostructure paves the way for achieving quantum sensing with unprecedented nanometer-scale spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Spin Caloritronics in irradiated chiral ferromagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP, with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological Reality Switch: Towards Bulk-Boundary Selective Lasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of complex spectra in non-Hermitian systems causes dramatic changes even under weak perturbations, significantly hindering their precise control for study and integration into practical applications. Achieving a controlled method to generate a real spectrum in non-Hermitian systems has long been a key objective in the field. In this study, we explore the 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and introduce a reality switch that allows for the controllable induction of a real spectrum depending on the imposed boundary condition. We show that a topological phase transition in the complex gap accompanies the switching process. Our work lays the cornerstone for developing a selective bulk-boundary control mechanism for the gain and lasing behaviors in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Particle deposit patterns from evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work investigates numerically the transport of colloidal particles within an evaporating sessile droplet and their deposition on the substrate in unfavourable conditions. The coupled phenomena of fluid flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change are modelled by taking into account for the evaporative cooling effect, the surface tension gradient effect at liquid air interface and the particles-substrate interaction effect due to DLVO attractive forces.The results show that in presence of the particles-substrate interaction, the outward radial internal flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving rise a ring like pattern with inner traces, while the thermal Marangoni internal flow reduces this effect giving rise a uniform deposit with a dark periphery.</description>

      <title>Engineering Quantum Wire States for Atom Scale Circuitry</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</description>

      <title>Scattering States in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)]. In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Time- and Polarization-Resolved Extreme Ultraviolet Momentum Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the development of an instrument combining an ultrafast, high-repetition-rate, polarization-tunable monochromatic extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 21.6 eV) beamline and a next-generation momentum microscope endstation. This setup enables time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of quantum materials, offering multimodal photoemission dichroism capabilities. The momentum microscope simultaneously detects the full surface Brillouin zone over an extended binding energy range. It is equipped with advanced electron optics, including a new type of front lens that supports multiple operational modes. Enhanced spatial resolution is achieved by combining the small XUV beam footprint (33 $\mu$m by 45 $\mu$m) with the selection of small regions of interest using apertures positioned in the Gaussian plane of the momentum microscope. This instrument achieves an energy resolution of 44 meV and a temporal resolution of 144 fs. We demonstrate the capability to perform linear, Fourier, and circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions from photoexcited 2D materials. This functionality paves the way for time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved investigations of orbital and quantum geometrical properties underlying electronic structures of quantum materials driven out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce N\'eel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Cold Mechanical Quantum Sensor for Tests of New Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initialization of mechanical modes in the quantum ground state is crucial for their use in quantum information and quantum sensing protocols. In quantum processors, impurity of the modes' initial state affects the infidelity of subsequent quantum algorithms. In quantum sensors, excitations out of the ground state contribute to the noise of the detector, and their prevalence puts a bound on rare events that deposit energy into the mechanical modes. In this work, we measure the excited-state populations of GHz-frequency modes in a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR). We find that the population of the first excited state can be as low as $P_p$=(1.2$\pm$5.5)$\times10^{-5}$, corresponding to an effective temperature of 25.2 mK, which are upper bounds limited by imperfections in the measurement process. These results compare favorably to the lowest populations measured in superconducting circuits. Finally, we use the measured populations to constrain the amplitude of high-frequency gravitational waves, the kinetic mixing strength of ultra-light dark matter, and non-linear modifications of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation describing wavefunction collapse mechanisms. Our work establishes HBARs as a versatile resource for quantum state initialization and studies of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric performance of a minimally nonlinear voltage probe and voltage-temperature probe heat engine with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric performance of minimally nonlinear irreversible heat engines with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS), realized through voltage and voltage-temperature probe configurations. Our framework extends the Onsager relations by incorporating a nonlinear power dissipation term into the heat current. We derive and analyze analytical expressions for the efficiency at a given power and the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), expressed in terms of asymmetry parameters and generalized figures of merit. Our analysis reveals that the combined effects of broken TRS and nonlinear dissipation give rise to two universal bounds on the EMP that can surpass the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) limit. Although these bounds share a similar analytical form, differences in Carnot efficiency and asymmetry parameters lead to distinct operational characteristics, as shown through numerical simulations. We consider a triple-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm heat engine incorporating either a voltage probe or a voltage-temperature probe. In both cases, TRS is broken by the magnetic flux. However, the voltage-temperature probe requires an additional anisotropy in the system for its TRS-breaking effects to significantly influence transport. We examine the role of this anisotropy in enhancing performance. Our results show that the EMP and efficiency at a given power can be enhanced by increasing the strength of nonlinear power dissipation, even though the output power remains unchanged. The voltage probe configuration generally yields higher power, while the voltage-temperature probe is more efficient, except in certain regimes where large asymmetries and high figures of merit allow the voltage probe setup to outperform.</description>

      <title>Delocalized Excitation Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>Visualizing isospin magnetic texture and intervalley exchange interaction in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tunable band structure and nontrivial topology of multilayer rhombohedral graphene lead to a variety of correlated electronic states with isospin orders-meaning ordered states in the combined spin and valley degrees of freedom-dictated by the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Hunds exchange interactions. However, methods for mapping local isospin textures and determining the exchange energies are currently lacking. Here, we image the magnetization textures in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene using a nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device. We observe sharp magnetic phase transitions that indicate spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. In the quarter-metal phase, the spin and orbital moments align closely, providing a bound on the spin-orbit coupling energy. We also show that the half-metal phase has a very small magnetic anisotropy, which provides an experimental lower bound on the intervalley Hunds exchange interaction energy. This is found to be close to its theoretical upper bound. The ability to resolve the local isospin texture and the different interaction energies will allow a better understanding of the phase transition hierarchy and the numerous correlated electronic states arising from spontaneous and induced isospin symmetry breaking in graphene heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.07821v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new dark-matter detection strategy that will potentially enable the search for super-light dark matter $m_\chi \simeq 0.1$ keV, improving the minimum detectable mass by more than three orders of magnitude compared to ongoing experiments. This can be achieved by intimately integrating the target material, specifically the $\pi$-bond electrons in graphene, into a Josephson junction to create a highly sensitive detector capable of detecting energy deposits from dark matter as small as $\sim 0.1$ meV. We investigate detection prospects of pg-, ng-, and $\mu$g-scale detectors by calculating the scattering rate between dark matter and free electrons confined in two-dimensional graphene, including Pauli-blocking factors and in-medium screening effects. We find that the proposed detector is expected to not only serve as a complementary probe of super-light dark matter but also achieve higher experimental sensitivities than other proposed experiments, assuming zero readout noise, thanks to the extremely low threshold energy of our graphene Josephson junction sensor.</description>

Abstract: A quantum description is given of nanoskyrmions in 2D textures with localised spins and itinerant electrons, isolated or coupled to leads, in or out-of-equilibrium. The spin-electron exchange is treated at the mean-field level, while Tensor Networks and exact diagonalization or nonequilibrium Green's functions are used for localised spins and itinerant electrons. We motivate our scheme via exact and mean-field benchmarks, then show by several examples that itinerant electrons distinctly affect the properties of quantum nanoskyrmions. Finally, we mention lines of future work and improvement of the approach.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Delocalization Induced by Residue Imaginary Velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dichotomy of localization versus delocalization is a historic topic central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. In sharp contrast to conventional formalisms through extended wavefunctions, these target systems exhibit delocalization in collective physical properties such as correlation and entanglement (of the Fermi Seas) despite sometimes localized left and right single-particle eigenstates, as we demonstrate numerically and generalize to scenarios with finite temperatures and interaction. Interestingly, disorder contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may also allow strong-disorder delocalization. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and harbors interesting experiments and practical applications.</description>

      <title>The impact of morphological structure and flexo-chemical strains on the electric transport mechanisms in the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric conduction mechanisms are studied in the pressed nanoflake powder of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) depending on their content and structure. The MoSxOy nanoflakes were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. The sintered nanoflakes are 10-20 nm thick and self-assembled in the "nanoflower"-shape aggregates forming powder particles. The chemical composition and structure of the powders were studied by XPS, EDS and Raman spectroscopy, which show that the powders have different chemical composition and structure depending on the preparation conditions. These studies revealed the existence of different forms of MoS2 and its oxides in the powders. These features are impactful on electric transport properties. The current-voltage (I-V) curves of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal hysteresis-like behavior; at that the loop width depends on the chemical composition and structure. The negative differential conductivity is observed for the highest content of Mo in oxide/sulfoxide form. The I-V curves of all MoSxOy nanoflake samples manifest the three-state resistive switching and the long-lasting transient charge/discharge on switching "on/off" the voltage across the sample, which evidences the role of interface charges in their conductivity. To describe theoretically the observed I-V curves, polar and electric-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, the Landau-Cahn-Hilliard approach considering flexo-chemical field has been used. The revealed experimentally and explained theoretically features of resistive switching and charge accumulation look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>First order Quantum Hall to Wigner crystal phase transition on a triangular lattice: an iDMRG study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study a system of interacting fermions on a triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moir\'e heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.</description>
