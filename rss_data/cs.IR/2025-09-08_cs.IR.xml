      <title>Unified Representation Learning for Multi-Intent Diversity and Behavioral Uncertainty in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in real-world recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Foundation Model-Driven User Interest Modeling and Behavior Analysis on Short Video Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.</description>

      <title>Fishing for Answers: Exploring One-shot vs. Iterative Retrieval Strategies for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) is a powerful solution to understand and query the industry's closed-source documents. However, basic RAG often struggles with complex QA tasks in legal and regulatory domains, particularly when dealing with numerous government documents. The top-$k$ strategy frequently misses golden chunks, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these retrieval bottlenecks, we explore two strategies to improve evidence coverage and answer quality. The first is a One-SHOT retrieval method that adaptively selects chunks based on a token budget, allowing as much relevant content as possible to be included within the model's context window. Additionally, we design modules to further filter and refine the chunks. The second is an iterative retrieval strategy built on a Reasoning Agentic RAG framework, where a reasoning LLM dynamically issues search queries, evaluates retrieved results, and progressively refines the context over multiple turns. We identify query drift and retrieval laziness issues and further design two modules to tackle them. Through extensive experiments on a dataset of government documents, we aim to offer practical insights and guidance for real-world applications in legal and regulatory domains.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems, demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Ecologically Valid Benchmarking and Adaptive Attention: Scalable Marine Bioacoustic Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal data for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal dependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks. Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.</description>

      <title>KERAG: Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Advanced Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing, which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation, thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs, reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions. Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.</description>

      <title>REMOTE: A Unified Multimodal Relation Extraction Framework with Multilevel Optimal Transport and Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel \textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized. Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information, we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Small Transformer-Based Language Models for Multi-Label Sentiment Analysis in Short Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e., BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings. Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1) continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation, and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text datasets.</description>

      <title>Yesterday's News: Benchmarking Multi-Dimensional Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Misinformation Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces misinfo-general, a benchmark dataset for evaluating misinformation models' ability to perform out-of-distribution generalization. Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Vector Search: An Experimental Evaluation of the State-of-the-Art</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector data is prevalent across business and scientific applications, and its popularity is growing with the proliferation of learned embeddings. Vector data collections often reach billions of vectors with thousands of dimensions, thus, increasing the complexity of their analysis. Vector search is the backbone of many critical analytical tasks, and graph-based methods have become the best choice for analytical tasks that do not require guarantees on the quality of the answers. We briefly survey in-memory graph-based vector search, outline the chronology of the different methods and classify them according to five main design paradigms: seed selection, incremental insertion, neighborhood propagation, neighborhood diversification, and divide-and-conquer. We conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art methods on seven real data collections, with sizes up to 1 billion vectors. We share key insights about the strengths and limitations of these methods; e.g., the best approaches are typically based on incremental insertion and neighborhood diversification, and the choice of the base graph can hurt scalability. Finally, we discuss open research directions, such as the importance of devising more sophisticated data-adaptive seed selection and diversification strategies.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise in collaborative filtering by capturing the underlying distribution of user interests and preferences. However, existing approaches struggle with inaccurate posterior approximations and misalignment with the discrete nature of recommendation data, limiting their expressiveness and real-world performance. To address these limitations, we propose FlowCF, a novel flow-based recommendation system leveraging flow matching for collaborative filtering. We tailor flow matching to the unique challenges in recommendation through two key innovations: (1) a behavior-guided prior that aligns with user behavior patterns to handle the sparse and heterogeneous user-item interactions, and (2) a discrete flow framework to preserve the binary nature of implicit feedback while maintaining the benefits of flow matching, such as stable training and efficient inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowCF achieves state-of-the-art recommendation accuracy across various datasets with the fastest inference speed, making it a compelling approach for real-world recommender systems. The code is available at https://github.com/chengkai-liu/FlowCF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: YouTube is among the most widely-used platforms worldwide, and has seen a lot of recent academic attention. Despite its popularity and the number of studies conducted on it, much less is understood about the way in which YouTube's Data API, and especially the Search endpoint, operates. In this paper, we analyze the API's behavior by running identical queries across a period of 12 weeks. Our findings show that the search endpoint returns highly variable results between queries. Specifically, the API seems to randomize returned videos based on the relative popularity of the respective topic during the query period, making it nearly impossible to obtain representative historical video samples, especially during non-peak topical periods. Our results also suggest that the API may prioritize shorter, more popular videos, although the role of channel popularity is not as clear. We conclude with suggested strategies for researchers using the API for data collection, as well as future research directions on expanding the API's use-cases.</description>

      <title>ELIXIR: Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models, especially in review generation.</description>

      <title>Global-to-Local or Local-to-Global? Enhancing Image Retrieval with Efficient Local Search and Effective Global Re-ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local, stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost. Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.</description>

      <title>Modeling Sequential Sentence Relation to Improve Cross-lingual Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently multi-lingual pre-trained language models (PLM) such as mBERT and XLM-R have achieved impressive strides in cross-lingual dense retrieval. Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach. Code and model are available at https://github.com/shunyuzh/MSM.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Hubness in Multi-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hubness is a phenomenon in high-dimensional vector spaces where a point from the natural distribution is unusually close to many other points. This is a well-known problem in information retrieval that causes some items to accidentally (and incorrectly) appear relevant to many queries.
  In this paper, we investigate how attackers can exploit hubness to turn any image or audio input in a multi-modal retrieval system into an adversarial hub. Adversarial hubs can be used to inject universal adversarial content (e.g., spam) that will be retrieved in response to thousands of different queries, and also for targeted attacks on queries related to specific, attacker-chosen concepts.
  We present a method for creating adversarial hubs and evaluate the resulting hubs on benchmark multi-modal retrieval datasets and an image-to-image retrieval system implemented by Pinecone, a popular vector database. For example, in text-caption-to-image retrieval, a single adversarial hub, generated using 100 random queries, is retrieved as the top-1 most relevant image for more than 21,000 out of 25,000 test queries (by contrast, the most common natural hub is the top-1 response to only 102 queries), demonstrating the strong generalization capabilities of adversarial hubs. We also investigate whether techniques for mitigating natural hubness can also mitigate adversarial hubs, and show that they are not effective against hubs that target queries related to specific concepts.</description>

      <title>Text2Cypher Across Languages: Evaluating and Finetuning LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database accessibility, most research today focuses on English, with limited evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of both foundational and finetuned LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create and release a multilingual dataset by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair cross-lingual comparison. Using standardized prompts and metrics, we evaluate several foundational models and observe a consistent performance pattern: highest on English, followed by Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute this to differences in training data availability and linguistic features. We also examine the impact of translating task prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Furthermore, we finetune a foundational model on two datasets: one in English only, and one multilingual. Finetuning on English improves overall accuracy but widens the performance gap between languages. In contrast, multilingual finetuning narrows the gap, resulting in more balanced performance. Our findings highlight the importance for multilingual evaluation and training to build more inclusive and robust query generation systems.</description>

      <title>Abex-rat: Synergizing Abstractive Augmentation and Adversarial Training for Classification of Occupational Accident Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes. Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced classification tasks. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ABEX-RAT.</description>
