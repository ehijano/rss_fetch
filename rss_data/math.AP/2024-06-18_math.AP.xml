      <title>$L^p$ asymptotic stability of 1D damped wave equation with nonlinear distributed damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the one-dimensional wave equation with localized nonlinear damping and Dirichlet boundary conditions, in the $L^p$ framework, with $p\in [1,\infty)$.
  We start by addressing the well-posedness problem. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of weak and strong solutions for $p\in [1,\infty)$, under suitable assumptions on the damping function.
  Then we study the asymptotic behaviour of the associated energy when $p \in (1,\infty)$, and we provide decay estimates that appear to be almost optimal as compared to a similar problem with boundary damping.
  Our study is motivated by earlier works, in particular, \cite{Haraux2009, Chitour-Marx-Prieur-2020}. Our proofs combine arguments from \cite{KMJC2022} (wave equation in the $L^p$ framework with a linear damping) with a technique of weighted energy estimates (\cite{PM-COCV}) and new integral inequalities when $p&gt;2$, and with convex analysis tools when $p\in (1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions to elliptic equations in 2D exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic behavior of solutions to the second order elliptic equations in exterior domains is studied. In particular, under the assumption that the solution belongs to the Lorentz space $L^{p,q}$ or the weak Lebesgue space $L^{p,\infty}$ with certain conditions on the coefficients, we give natural and an almost sharp pointwise estimate of the solution at spacial infinity. The proof is based on the argument by Korobkov--Pileckas--Russo [4], in which the decay property of the solution to the vorticity equation of the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations was studied.</description>

      <title>Riemann problem for Aw-Rascle model with more realistic version of extended Chaplygin gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivation of this study is to find the Riemann solutions of Aw-Rascle model with friction for a more realistic version of extended Chaplygin gas. Firstly, we established the $ \delta $-shock wave in its solutions; indeed, by using generalized Rankine Hugoniot jump conditions the position, strength, and velocity of $ \delta $-shock are obtained. Further, by analyzing the limiting behavior, it is found that one of the Riemann solutions converges to $ \delta $-shock solution as the pressure approaches to generalized Chaplygin gas pressure. Moreover, we obtained that our Riemann solutions converge to the corresponding solutions of the transport equations as pressure tends to zero. Furthermore, we explicitly construct the Riemann solutions of the inhomogeneous Aw-Rascle model.</description>

      <title>Almost conservation of the harmonic actions for fully discretized nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations at low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close to the origin, the nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on the circle are nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems which have infinitely many almost conserved quantities called harmonic actions or super-actions. We prove that, at low regularity and with a CFL number of size 1, this property is preserved if we discretize the nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations with the symplectic mollified impulse methods. This extends previous results of D. Cohen, E. Hairer and C. Lubich to non-smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>Interpolated time-H\"older regularity of solutions of fully nonlinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show by the maximum principle that a quantitative estimate of the H\"older continuity of a solution of a fully nonlinear parabolic equation with respect to the spatial variable $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, with exponent $\alpha\in(0,1]$, implies an estimate of its H\"older continuity in the time variable with the (natural) exponent $\alpha/2$. This holds without assuming any H\"older continuity of the data of the equation. We apply this nonvariational approach to prove interior Schauder estimates for a special class of fully nonlinear parabolic Isaacs equations, providing an Evans-Krylov result for the model equation $\min\{\inf_{\beta}L_\beta u,\sup_\gamma L_\gamma u\}-\partial_t u=0$, where $L_\beta,L_\gamma$ are linear operators with possibly variable H\"older coefficients. Along the way, we provide a short survey on the regularity theory for fully nonlinear parabolic equations of second order.</description>

      <title>Lattice tilings with minimal perimeter and unequal volumes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periodic tessellations of the Euclidean space with unequal cells arising from the minimization of perimeter functionals. Existence results and qualitative properties of minimizers are discussed for different classes of problems, involving local and non-local perimeters. Regularity is then addressed in the general case under volume penalization, and in the planar case with the standard perimeter, prescribing the volumes of each cell. Finally, we show the optimality of hexagonal tilings among partitions with almost equal areas.</description>

      <title>Solutions to a chemotaxis system with spatially heterogeneous diffusion sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system with spatially dependent diffusion sensitivity \begin{eqnarray*}
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_t = \nabla \cdot (|x|^\beta \nabla u) - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v), \\[1mm]
  0 = \Delta v - \mu + u,
  \qquad \mu:=\frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int\limits_\Omega u,
  \end{array} \right.
  \qquad \qquad (\star)
  \end{eqnarray*} under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in the ball $\Omega=B_R(0)\subset \mathbb R^n$.
  For $\beta&gt;0$ and radially symmetric H\"older continuous initial data, we prove that there exists a pointwise classical solution to $(\star)$ in $(\Omega\setminus \{0\})\times (0,T)$ for some $T&gt;0$. For radially decreasing initial data satisfying certain compatibility criteria, this solution is bounded and unique in $(\Omega\setminus \{0\})\times (0,T^*)$ for some $T^*&gt;0$. Moreover, for $n \geq 2$ and sufficiently accumulated initial data, there exists no solution $(u,v)$ to $(\star)$ in the sense specified above which is globally bounded in time.</description>

      <title>Low mach Number Limit of the Viscous and Heat Conductive Flow with general pressure law on torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the low Mach number limit from compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with the general pressure law around a constant state on the torus $\mathbb{T}^N_a$. We view this limit as a special case of the weakly nonlinear-dissipative approximation of the general hyperbolic-parabolic system with entropy. In particular, we consider the ill-prepared initial data, for which the group of fast acoustic waves is needed to be filtered. This extends the previous works, in particular Danchin [ Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), 1153-1219] in two ways: 1. We treat the fully general non-isentropic flow, i.e. the pressure depends on the density $\rho$ and temperature $\theta$ by basic thermodynamic law. We illustrate the role played by the entropy structure of the system in the coupling of the acoustic waves and incompressible flow, and the construction of the filtering group. 2. We refine the small divisor estimate, which helps us to give the first explicit convergence rate of the filtered acoustic waves whose propogation is governed by non-local averaged system. In previous works, only convergence rate of incompressible limit was obtained.</description>

      <title>Liouville results for semilinear integral equations with conical diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonexistence results for positive supersolutions of the equation $$-Lu=u^p\quad\text{in $\mathbb R^N_+$}$$ are obtained, $-L$ being any symmetric and stable linear operator, positively homogeneous of degree $2s$, $s\in(0,1)$, whose spectral measure is absolutely continuous and positive only in a relative open set of the unit sphere of $\mathbb R^N$. The results are sharp: $u\equiv 0$ is the only nonnegative supersolution in the subcritical regime $1\leq p\leq\frac{N+s}{N-s}\,$, while nontrivial supersolutions exist, at least for some specific $-L$, as soon as $p&gt;\frac{N+s}{N-s}$. \\ The arguments used rely on a rescaled test function's method, suitably adapted to such nonlocal setting with weak diffusion; they are quite general and also employed to obtain Liouville type results in the whole space.</description>

      <title>Almost-everywhere uniqueness of Lagrangian trajectories for $3$D Navier--Stokes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for any Leray solution $u$ to the $3$D Navier--Stokes equations with $u_0\in L^2$, the associated Lagrangian trajectories are unique for Lebesgue a.e. initial condition. Additionally, if $u_0\in H^{1/2}$, then pathwise uniqueness is established for the stochastic Lagrangian trajectories starting from every initial condition. The result sharpens and extends the original one by Robinson and Sadowski (Nonlinearity 2009) and is based on rather different techniques. A key role is played by a newly established asymmetric Lusin--Lipschitz property of Leray solutions $u$, in the framework of (random) Regular Lagrangian flows.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law and convergence in the classical limit for min-max nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{CFS}, the author and collaborators construct infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, obtaining an analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$. The present article proves a Weyl Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces, and it shows their convergence as $s\to 1$ (for $n=3$) to smooth classical minimal surfaces. Our results are used in particular to give a novel proof of the density and equidistribution of classical minimal surfaces for generic metrics in three dimensions, showcasing nonlocal minimal surfaces also as a new approximation theory for the area functional.</description>

      <title>Convergence of cluster coagulation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study hydrodynamic limits of the cluster coagulation model; a coagulation model introduced by Norris [$\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}$, 209(2):407-435 (2000)]. In this process, pairs of particles $x,y$ in a measure space $E$, merge to form a single new particle $z$ according to a transition kernel $K(x, y, \mathrm{d} z)$, in such a manner that a quantity, one may regard as the total mass of the system, is conserved. This model is general enough to incorporate various inhomogeneities in the evolution of clusters, for example, their shape, or their location in space. We derive sufficient criteria for trajectories associated with this process to concentrate among solutions of a generalisation of the $\textit{Flory equation}$, and, in some special cases, by means of a uniqueness result for solutions of this equation, prove a weak law of large numbers. This multi-type Flory equation is associated with $\textit{conserved quantities}$ associated with the process, which may encode different information to conservation of mass (for example, conservation of centre of mass in spatial models). We also apply criteria for gelation in this process to derive sufficient criteria for this equation to exhibit gelling solutions. When this occurs, this multi-type Flory equation encodes, via the associated conserved property, the interaction between the gel and the finite size sol particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof for the Kato square root problem on suitable open sets and subject to pure Dirichlet boundary conditions. In contrast to earlier work, our proof uses only second-order techniques and is in the spirit of the proof given by Egert--Haller--Monniaux--Tolksdorf in the scope of the 27th international internet seminar for $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$. In contrast to the usual proofs based on the first-order framework by Axelsson--Keith--McIntosh, the proof becomes substantially shorter and technically less demanding.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic equations with super-critical dissipation. For large initial data in critical Sobolev and Besov spaces, we prove optimal Gevrey regularity with the same decay exponent as the linear part.

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for bi-Schr\"odinger operators on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establishing several types of $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators $W_\pm=W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ associated with the bi-Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^{2}+V(x)$ on the line $\mathbb{R}$. Given suitable decay potentials $V$, we firstly prove that the wave and dual wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$: $$ \|W_\pm f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}+\|W_\pm^* f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}\lesssim \|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})},$$ which are further extended to the $L^p$-boundedness on the weighted spaces $L^p(\mathbb{R},w)$ with general even $A_p$-weights $w$ and to the boundedness on the Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$. For the limiting case, we prove that $W_\pm$ are bounded from $L^1(\R)$ to $L^{1,\infty}(\R)$ as well as bounded from the Hardy space $\H^1(\R)$ to $L^1(\R)$. These results especially hold whatever the zero energy is a regular point or a resonance of $H$. We also obtain that $W_\pm$ are bounded from $L^\infty(\R)$ to $\BMO(\R)$ if zero is a regular point or a first kind resonance of $H$. Next, we show that $W_\pm$ are neither bounded on $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ nor on $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ even if zero is a regular point of $H$. Moreover, if zero is a second kind resonance of $H$, then $W_\pm$ are shown to be even not bounded from $L^\infty(\R)$ to $\BMO(\R)$ in general. In particular, we remark that our results give a complete picture of the validity of $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators for all $1\le p\le \infty$ in the regular case. Finally, as applications, we deduce the $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates for the propagator $e^{-itH}P_{\mathrm{ac}}(H)$ with pairs $(1/p,1/q)$ belonging to a certain region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, as well as establish the H\"ormander-type $L^p$-boundedness theorem for the spectral multiplier $f(H)$.</description>

Abstract: We study the additive eigenvalues on changing domains, along with the associated vanishing discount problems. We consider the convergence of the vanishing discount problem on changing domains for a general scaling type $\Omega_\lambda = (1+r(\lambda))\Omega$ with a continuous function $r$ and a positive constant $\lambda$. We characterize all solutions to the ergodic problem on $\Omega$ in terms of $r$. In addition, we demonstrate that the additive eigenvalue $\lambda\mapsto c_{\Omega_\lambda}$ on a rescaled domain $\Omega_\lambda = (1+\lambda)\Omega$ possesses one-sided derivatives everywhere. Additionally, the limiting solution can be parameterized by a real function, and we establish a connection between the regularity of this real function and the regularity of $\lambda \mapsto c_{\Omega_\lambda}$. We provide examples where higher regularity is achieved.</description>

      <title>From Volterra dislocations to strain-gradient plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a strain-gradient model of plasticity as a $\Gamma$-limit of continuum bodies containing finitely-many edge-dislocations (in two dimensions). The key difference from previous such derivations is the elemental notion of a dislocation: we work in a continuum framework in which the lattice structure is represented by a smooth frame field, and the presence of a dislocation manifests in a circulation condition on that frame field; the resulting model is a Lagrangian approach with a multiplicative strain decomposition. The multiplicative nature of the geometric incompatibility generates many technical challenges, which require a systematic study of the geometry of bodies containing multiple dislocations, the definition of new notions of convergence, and the derivation of new geometric rigidity estimates pertinent to dislocated bodies. Our approach places the strain-gradient limit in a unified framework with other models of dislocations, which cannot be addressed within the "admissible strain" approach used in previous works.</description>

      <title>Generalized convergence of solutions for nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations with state-constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a continuous Hamiltonian $H : (x, p, u) \in T^*\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we consider the asymptotic behavior of associated Hamilton--Jacobi equations with state-constraint $H(x, Du, \lambda u) \leq C_\lambda$ in $\Omega_\lambda\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $H(x, Du, \lambda u) \geq C_\lambda$ on $\overline{\Omega}_\lambda\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a $\lambda\rightarrow 0^+$. When $H$ satisfies certain convex, coercive, and monotone conditions, the domain $\Omega_\lambda:=(1+r(\lambda))\Omega$ keeps bounded, star-shaped for all $\lambda&gt;0$ with $\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow 0^+}r(\lambda)=0$, and $\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow 0^+}C_\lambda=c(H)$ equals the ergodic constant of $H(\cdot,\cdot,0)$, we prove the convergence of solutions $u_\lambda$ to a specific solution of the critical equation $H(x, Du, 0)\leq c(H) $ in $\Omega$ and $H(x, Du, 0)\geq c(H) $ on $\overline{\Omega}$. We also discuss the generalization of such a convergence for equations with more
  general $C_\lambda$ and $\Omega_\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Parabolic boundary Harnack inequalities with right-hand side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the parabolic boundary Harnack inequality in parabolic flat Lipschitz domains by blow-up techniques, allowing for the first time a non-zero right-hand side. Our method allows us to treat solutions to equations driven by non-divergence form operators with bounded measurable coefficients, and a right-hand side $f \in L^q$ for $q &gt; n+2$. In the case of the heat equation, we also show the optimal $C^{1-\varepsilon}$ regularity of the quotient.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new way to prove that flat Lipschitz free boundaries are $C^{1,\alpha}$ in the parabolic obstacle problem and in the parabolic Signorini problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system in a bounded domain $\Omega$ with the specular reflection condition. Our result covers the case when $\Omega$ is a non-convex domain, e.g., solid torus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first local well-posedness result for a nonlinear kinetic model with a self-consistent magnetic effect in a three-dimensional $\textbf{bounded}$ domain.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability of the Inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov System in Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov system in $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the initial fluid density is allowed to vanish. We establish the uniform bound of the macroscopic density associated with the distribution function and prove the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the Cauchy problem with vacuum for either small initial energy or large viscosity coefficient. The uniform boundedness and the presence of vacuum enable us to show that as the time evolves, the fluid velocity decays, while the distribution function concentrates towards a Dirac measure in velocity centred at $0$, with an exponential rate. In order to overcome the degeneracy in the momentum equations, we develop an energy argument based on higher order functional inequalities designed for fluid-particle coupled structures.</description>

Abstract: The equation $- \Delta u + V u = 0$ in the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times (0,2\pi)^d$ with periodic boundary conditions is considered. The potential $V$ is assumed to be bounded, and both functions $u$ and $V$ are assumed to be real-valued. It is shown that the fastest rate of decay at infinity of non-trivial solution $u$ is $O\left(e^{-c|w|}\right)$ for $d=1$ or $2$, and $O\left(e^{-c|w|^{4/3}}\right)$ for $d\ge 3$. Here $w$ is the axial variable.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the 3D Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Ikoma (2022) considered optimal constants and extremisers for the $2$-dimensional Dirac equation using the spherical harmonics decomposition. Though its argument is valid in any dimensions $d \geq 2$, the case $d \geq 3$ remains open since it leads us to too complicated calculation: determining all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of infinite dimensional matrices. In this paper, we give optimal constants and extremisers of smoothing estimates for the $3$-dimensional Dirac equation. In order to prove this, we construct a certain orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics. With respect to this basis, infinite dimensional matrices actually become block diagonal and so that eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be easily found. As applications, we obtain the equivalence of the smoothing estimate for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the Dirac equation, and improve a result by Ben-Artzi and Umeda (2021).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a polynomial convergence rate for homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations with quasi-periodic potentials. We establish a connection between the convergence rate of homogenization and the regularity of the effective Hamiltonian, by using a new quantitative ergodic estimate for bounded quasi-periodic functions with Diophantine frequencies. As an application, we also study the convergent rate for Birkhoff average of unbounded quasi-periodic functions.</description>

      <title>Boundary-field formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by dielectric scatterers and coated conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $0 &lt; q,r &lt; \infty$. We characterize the validity of the inequality for the composition of the Hardy operator, \begin{equation*} \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^x \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)ds \bigg)^q u(t) dt \bigg)^{\frac{r}{q}} w(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{r}} \leq C \bigg(\int_a^b f(x)^p v(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{p}} \end{equation*} for all non-negative measurable functions $f$ on $(a,b)$, $-\infty \leq a &lt; b \leq \infty$. We construct a more straightforward discretization method than those previously presented in the literature, and we provide some new scales of weight characterizations of this inequality in both discrete and continuous forms and we obtain previous characterizations as the special case of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Equations for small amplitude shallow water waves over small bathymetric variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized version of the $abcd$-Boussinesq class of systems is derived to accommodate variable bottom topography in two-dimensional space. This extension allows for the conservation of suitable energy functionals in some cases and enables the description of water waves in closed basins with well-justified slip-wall boundary conditions. The derived systems possess a form that ensures their solutions adhere to important principles of physics and mathematics. By demonstrating their consistency with the Euler equations and estimating their approximation error, we establish the validity of these new systems. Their derivation is based on the assumption of small bathymetric variations. With practical applications in mind, we assess the effectiveness of some of these new systems through comparisons with standard benchmarks. The results indicate that the assumptions made during the derivation are not overly restrictive. The applications of the new systems encompass a wide range of scenarios, including the study of tsunamis, tidal waves, and waves in ports and lakes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference least square methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm to approximate the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi~(HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network. The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based algorithm to minimize the least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution. The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical studies on various canonical HJ equations across different dimensions, showcasing its potential and versatility.</description>
