      <title>M*-categories: Where limits in analysis and category theory meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces M*-categories: an abstraction of categories with similar algebraic and analytic properties to the categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. M*-categories are "analytically" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These "analytic" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these universal constructions are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries.</description>

      <title>Alpay Algebra II: Identity as Fixed-Point Emergence in Categorical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second installment of the Alpay Algebra framework, I formally define identity as a fixed point that emerges through categorical recursion. Building upon the transfinite operator $\varphi^\infty$, I characterize identity as the universal solution to a self-referential functorial equation over a small cartesian closed category. I prove the existence and uniqueness of such identity-fixed-points via ordinal-indexed iteration, and interpret their convergence through internal categorical limits. Functors, adjunctions, and morphisms are reconstructed as dynamic traces of evolving states governed by $\varphi$, reframing identity not as a static label but as a stabilized process. Through formal theorems and symbolic flows, I show how these fixed points encode symbolic memory, recursive coherence, and semantic invariance. This paper positions identity as a mathematical structure that arises from within the logic of change itself computable, convergent, and categorically intrinsic.</description>

      <title>On 2-categories of extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is essentially an illustration for the general technology of homotopical enhancements developed recently in arxiv:2409.17489. We take the derived category of an abelian category, and we look at the full subcategory spanned by complexes of length 2. This has a natural refinement to a 2-category that we call "the 2-category of extensions". However, just using the triangulated structure on the derived category is not enough to obtain this refinement. In this short note, we first construct the 2-category of extensions by hand -- that is, using abelian category techniques -- and then show how it can be recovered very easily and naturally in the enhanced formalism of arxiv:2409.17489.</description>

      <title>Quantization of infinitesimal braidings and pre-Cartier quasi-bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Cartier's deformation theorem of braided monoidal categories admitting an infinitesimal braiding to the non-symmetric case. The algebraic counterpart of these categories is the notion of a pre-Cartier quasi-bialgebra, which extends the well-known notion of quasitriangular quasi-bialgebra given by Drinfeld. Our result implies that one can quantize the infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrix of any Cartier quasi-bialgebra. We further discuss the emerging concepts of infinitesimal quantum Yang-Baxter equation and Cartier ring, the latter containing braid groups with additional generators that correspond to infinitesimal braidings. Explicit deformations of the representation categories of the gauge deformed quasitriangular quasi-bialgebras $E(n)$ are provided.</description>

      <title>R*-categories: The Hilbert-space analogue of abelian categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02883v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces R*-categories: an abstraction of categories exhibiting the "algebraic" aspects of the theory of Hilbert spaces. Notably, finite biproducts in R*-categories can be orthogonalised using the Gram-Schmidt process, and generalised notions of positivity and contraction support a variant of Sz.-Nagy's unitary dilation theorem. Underpinning these generalisations is the structure of an involutive identity-on-objects contravariant endofunctor, which encodes adjoints of morphisms. The R*-category axioms are otherwise inspired by those for abelian categories, comprising a few simple properties of products and kernels. Additivity is not assumed, but nevertheless follows. In fact, the similarity with abelian categories runs deeper: R*-categories are quasi-abelian and thus homological. Examples include the category of unitary representations of a group, the category of finite-dimensional inner product modules over a partially ordered division ring, and the category of self-dual Hilbert modules over a W*-algebra.</description>

      <title>An enriched small object argument over a cofibrantly generated base</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The small object argument is a method for transfinitely constructing weak factorization systems originally motivated by homotopy theory. We establish a variant of the small object argument that is enriched over a cofibrantly generated weak factorization system. This enriched variant of the small object argument subsumes the ordinary small object argument for categories and also certain variants of the small object argument for 2-categories, (2,1)-categories, dg-categories and simplicially enriched categories.</description>

      <title>The internal languages of univalent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal language theorems are fundamental in categorical logic, since they express an equivalence between syntax and semantics. One of such theorems was proven by Clairambault and Dybjer, who corrected the result originally by Seely. More specifically, they constructed a biequivalence between the bicategory of locally Cartesian closed categories and the bicategory of democratic categories with families with extensional identity types, $\sum$-types, and $\prod$-types. This theorem expresses that the internal language of locally Cartesian closed categories is extensional Martin-L\"of type theory with dependent sums and products. In this paper, we study the theorem by Clairambault and Dybjer for univalent categories, and we extend it to various classes of toposes, among which are $\prod$-pretoposes and elementary toposes. The results in this paper have been formalized using the proof assistant Rocq and the UniMath library.</description>

      <title>Oligomorphic groups, categories of partial bijections, and ultrahomogeneous cubic spaces over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for certain class of oligomorphic groups there is a version of multiplication of double cosets in the Ismagilov--Olshanski sense. Categories of (reduced) double cosets are realized as certain categories of partial bijections. As an example, we consider the ultrahomogeneous linear space $\mathcal{Z}$ of countable dimension over afinite field equipped with a cubic form. The group of automorphisms of $\mathcal{Z}$ is an oligomorphic group, we describe its open subgroups. According Tsankov, this gives a classification of its unitary representations. The category of reduced double cosets in this case is the category of partial linear bijections of finite-dimensional cubic spaces preserving cubic forms.</description>

      <title>Compact Matrix Quantum Group Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group equivariant neural networks have proven effective in modelling a wide range of tasks where the data lives in a classical geometric space and exhibits well-defined group symmetries. However, these networks are not suitable for learning from data that lives in a non-commutative geometry, described formally by non-commutative $C^{*}$-algebras, since the $C^{*}$-algebra of continuous functions on a compact matrix group is commutative. To address this limitation, we derive the existence of a new type of equivariant neural network, called compact matrix quantum group equivariant neural networks, which encode symmetries that are described by compact matrix quantum groups. We characterise the weight matrices that appear in these neural networks for the easy compact matrix quantum groups, which are defined by set partitions. As a result, we obtain new characterisations of equivariant weight matrices for some compact matrix groups that have not appeared previously in the machine learning literature.</description>
