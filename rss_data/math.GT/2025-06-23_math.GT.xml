      <title>Enumeration of virtual quandles up to isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual racks and virtual quandles are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the Reidemeister moves of virtual knots. In this note, we enumerate virtual dihedral quandles and several families of virtual permutation racks and virtual conjugation quandles up to isomorphism. We also classify virtual racks and virtual quandles up to order 8 using a computer search. These classifications are based on the conjugacy class structures of rack automorphism groups. In particular, we compute class numbers of holomorphs of finite cyclic groups, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Extending Quasi-alternating Links II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Champanerkar and Kofman [1] introduced an innovative method for constructing quasi-alternating links by substituting a quasi-alternating crossing c in a quasi-alternating link with a rational tangle of the same type. This construction was later extended by Chbili and Kaur [2] for any alternating tangle of same type.
  However, this approach does not generally apply to non-alternating tangles or alternating tangles of opposite types, although there are examples where it holds for alternating tangles of opposite type and certain non-alternating tangles. This raises a natural question to find the conditions and specific tangles for which this approach is applicable. In this paper, we explore this question by identifying several conditions under which this construction of new quasi-alternating links can still be valid for alternating tangles of opposite types. Additionally, we establish specific families of non-alternating tangles for which this construction is effective in creating new quasi-alternating links.</description>

      <title>Thin homotopy and the signature of piecewise linear surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a crossed module of piecewise linear surfaces and study the signature homomorphism, defined as the surface holonomy of a universal translation invariant $2$-connection. This provides a transform whereby surfaces are represented by formal series of tensors. Our main result is that the signature uniquely characterizes a surface up to translation and thin homotopy, also known as tree-like equivalence in the case of paths. This generalizes a result of Chen and positively answers a question of Kapranov in the setting of piecewise linear surfaces. As part of this work, we provide several equivalent definitions of thin homotopy, generalizing the plethora of definitions which exist in the case of paths. Furthermore, we develop methods for explicitly and efficiently computing the surface signature.</description>

      <title>Virtual knots and links with unknotting index (n,m)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [8], K. Kaur, S. Kamada et al. posed a problem of finding a virtual knot, if exists, with an unknotting index (n,m), where (n,m) is a pair of non-negative integers. In this paper, we address this question by providing infinite families of virtual knots with unknotting indices (0,m) and (1,0), respectively. In general, we establish the existence of infinitely many distinct virtual knot diagrams with unknotting index (n,m), for any pair (n,m) of positive integers. Furthermore, we positively address this question for k(&gt;1)-component virtual links positively by providing infinite families of k(&gt;1)-component virtual links with unknotting index (n,m), for a given pair of non-negative integers (n,m).</description>

      <title>On $h$-cobordisms of complexity $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $5$-dimensional $h$-cobordisms of Morgan-Szab\'o complexity $2$. We compute the monopole Floer homology and the action of the twisting involution of the protocork boundary associated with such $h$-cobordisms, obtaining an obstruction for $h$-cobordisms between exotic pairs to have minimal complexity. We construct the first examples of $h$-cobordisms of non-minimal, in fact, arbitrarily large, complexity between an exotic pair of closed, $1$-connected $4$-manifolds. Further applications include strong corks.</description>

      <title>On biquandle-based invariant of immersed surface-links and on Yoshikawa oriented fifth move</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve an open problem showing that the Yoshikawa's fifth oriented move in his list cannot be reproduced by any finite sequence of the other nine moves and planar isotopies. Our proof introduces a link-type semi-invariant that remains unchanged under all moves except the fifth; contrasting values on two equivalent diagrams force the move's independence. Second, we extend the algebraic toolkit for immersed surface-links. After revisiting the banded-unlink description of immersed surfaces and the twelve local moves that relate their diagrams, we develop a coloring theory based on biquandles. By assigning elements of a biquandle to diagram arcs according to local rules, we obtain a counting invariant of immersed surfaces up to isotopy.</description>

      <title>Minimal Surface Entropy and Average Area Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On any closed hyperbolizable 3-manifold, we find a sharp relation between the minimal surface entropy (introduced by Calegari-Marques-Neves) and the average area ratio (introduced by Gromov), and we show that, among metrics g with scalar curvature greater than or equal to -6, the former is maximized by the hyperbolic metric. One corollary is to solve a conjecture of Gromov regarding the average area ratio. Our proofs use Ricci flow with surgery and laminar measures invariant under a PSL(2,R)-action.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy and measures on limit sets of Anosov groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. For any Zariski dense Anosov subgroup $\Gamma &lt;G$, we show that a $\Gamma$-conformal measure is supported on the limit set of $\Gamma$ if and only if its "dimension" is $\Gamma$-critical. This implies the uniqueness of a $\Gamma$-conformal measure for each critical dimension. We deduce this from a higher rank analogue of the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy for the maximal diagonal action. Other applications include an analogue of the Ahlfors measure conjecture for Anosov subgroups.</description>

      <title>A presentation of the pure cactus group of degree four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple presentation of the pure cactus group $PJ_4$ of degree four. This presentation is obtained by considering an action of $PJ_4$ on the hyperbolic plane and constructing a Dirichlet polygon for the action. As a corollary, we provide a direct alternative proof that $PJ_4$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the connected sum of five real projective planes.</description>
