      <title>Chemical Systems as Ternary $\Gamma$-Semirings:Theory, Case Studies, and Operational Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical systems are traditionally described by lists of species, reactions, and externally imposed kinetic laws, a framework that lacks an intrinsic algebraic structure governing how transformations compose. We propose an axiomatic reformulation in which a chemical system is modelled as a ternary Gamma semiring (TGS), where chemical states form an additive semigroup, mediators encode catalytic or environmental context, and mediated transformations are represented by a ternary operation. We show that the TGS axioms admit direct physical interpretations: distributivity corresponds to ideal, non-interfering parallel reactions, while associativity characterizes thermodynamic path-independence. Classical systems including Michaelis-Menten kinetics, global equilibrium, and allosteric regulation are recovered as different algebraic regimes, and we develop operational tests that quantify departures from the axioms through experimentally measurable indices. The resulting framework unifies equilibrium, kinetics, regulation, and chemical computation within a single algebraic language, offering new principles for the analysis and design of responsive or self-regulating materials.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Resonance Theory: Kinetics and Frequency Response of Light-Promoted Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The illumination of catalytic surfaces with a continuous or pulsed stream of photons dynamically modulates surface chemistry for faster rates, higher conversion, or product selectivity control. To establish fundamental principles of dynamic photon-modulated catalysis, the photocatalytic conversion of a generic surface reaction was simulated to understand the kinetic implications of an independent stream of photons promoting surface product desorption. Simulations were conducted via the microkinetic model and kinetic Monte Carlo methods for the scenarios of a Poisson distribution, constant spacing between photons, and coordinated on/off pulsing of photon sources. The time-averaged photocatalytic rate at differential conditions for varying photon flux and temperatures indicated three kinetic regimes described by product thermal desorption control, surface reaction control, and an intermediate kinetic regime with a zero slope Arrhenius plot, consistent with a degree of rate control dominated by the photon arrival frequency (i.e., per-site photon flux). The maximum photocatalytic rate occurred orders of magnitude above the Sabatier limit at the resonance frequency, identified as the photon arrival frequency that matched the surface reaction rate constant. Non-equilibrium photocatalytic conversion occurred when the rate of photon-promoted product desorption was comparable to the rate of thermal product desorption. Results indicated the general utility of photon-promoted catalysis, with negligible benefit for rate enhancement and quantum yield with photon source pulsing or chopping due to the inherent dynamic nature of photons from light sources.</description>

      <title>The seeding method: A test case for classical nucleation theory in small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to investigate nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spin-adapted open-shell time-dependent density functional theory: towards a simple and accurate method for spin-flip-down excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in using spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (SF-TD-DFT) for spin-flip-down excitations is the presence of spin contamination. While several improved methods have been developed in the past, a simple and accurate method remains elusive. Here, based on our previous development on spin-adapted open-shell TD-DFT for spin-conserving excitations (X-TD-DFT) [Z. Li and W. Liu, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 194106 (2011)], we introduce a method termed as XSF-TDA for modeling spin-flip-down excitations, and provide an in-depth comparison of different methodologies for mitigating spin contamination in SF-TDA. Pilot applications to prototype systems demonstrate the promise of XSF-TDA over existing SF-TDA methods, including unrestricted SF-TDA (USF-TDA) and mixed-reference SF-TDA (MRSF-TDA), in describing bond breakings and inverted singlet-triplet gap systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital Surface Hopping with an Electron Thermostat Yields Accurate Dynamics and Detailed Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mixed quantum-classical simulations of molecule-metal surface interactions, the discretization of the metallic electronic continuum typically results in a closed-system representation that fails to capture the open-system nature of the true physical process. This approximation can introduce significant artifacts, including deviations in the dynamical evolution and a violation of the principle of detailed balance. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce an electronic thermostat into our previously developed orbital surface hopping (OSH) framework, generalizing the method to efficiently handle many discrete electronic states. We first outline the derivation of electronic thermostat orbital surface hopping, where the amplitude of the electronic thermostat is well justified. We then demonstrate that this method can reproduce accurate dynamics and detailed balance in long time, whereas without electronic thermostat the detailed balance is violated. Thus, this method offers a reliable tool for studying nonadiabatic dynamics near metal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum Jump Approach for Photosynthetic Energy Transfer with Chemical Reaction and Fluorescence Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry and coverage dependence in two-pulse correlation measurements of CO photodesorption from Pd(111): Insights from theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-pulse correlation experiments performed using pulses of different intensities on Pd(111) with different CO coverages showed that the CO photodesorption probability depends on whether the strong or the weak pulse arrives first to the surface, being this difference particularly large for the low-covered surface. Motivated by these experiments, we perform molecular dynamics simulations using a multicoverage potential energy surface that was previously constructed with the embedded atom neural network method. The process is modeled by combining the two-temperature model (2TM)--to describe the laser-excited electrons and phonons--and Langevin dynamics with electronic time-dependent temperature $T_\textrm{e}$--to model the coupling of the nuclei degrees of freedom with the laser-excited electrons. We show that improving the energy balance description in 2TM--by including \textit{ab-initio} $T_\textrm{e}$-dependent electronic heat capacity and electron-phonon coupling constant--is key to reproduce the asymmetry of the photodesorption probability $P_{\rm des}$ between positive and negative time delays. Furthermore, we also explore possible reasons for the usual underestimation of $P_{\rm des}$ at zero delay given by state-of-the-art calculations. In particular, we improve the description of the energy exchange between CO and the metal surface at high $T_\textrm{e}$ by including in the simulations a $T_\textrm{e}$-dependent friction coefficient. The prediction for $P_{\rm des}$ at zero delay in this case, increases by an order of magnitude, reducing its discrepancy with the experimental value. Altogether, our results hint to the importance of accounting for the temperature dependence of the electronic structure and properties in describing the extreme conditions generated in 2PC experiments.</description>

      <title>Density and excess molar enthalpy of (2-propanol + glyme) liquid mixtures. Application of the Flory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For glymes of general formula CH3O(CH2CH2O)uCH3, with u = 1, 2, 3, 4, the densities of the (2-propanol + glyme) systems at temperatures ranging from (293.15 to 303.15) K and at pressure 0.1 MPa were determined using a DSA 5000 densimeter (from Anton Paar). The corresponding excess molar volumes were calculated from these density measurements. In addition, excess molar enthalpies at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa were measured using a Tian-Calvet micro-calorimeter. The results show that alkanol-ether interactions are strong but do not contribute significantly to the excess molar enthalpy, as the values are large and positive, and comparable to those of (glyme + n-heptane) systems. The excess molar volumes are small or even negative (in the case of the mixture with u = 4), indicating that they are mainly governed by structural effects. Mixtures with 1-propanol or 2-propanol behave similarly, although interactions between unlike molecules become slightly stronger when 1-propanol is involved. On the other hand, effects related to alcohol self-association play a decisive role in the thermodynamic properties when glymes are replaced by di-n-propyl ether. This is supported by the application of the Flory model, which shows that orientational effects are weak in the studied glyme-containing mixtures but become significantly stronger when di-n-propyl ether is considered.</description>

      <title>Calculation and analysis of exciton couplings via a subsystem formulation of the $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fragment-based framework for analyzing exciton couplings within the $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter Equation formalism using localized molecular orbitals, and assess how excitonic states in molecular dimers can be decomposed into local and charge-transfer (CT) sectors. Our localization procedure preserves orbital orthonormality via a block-diagonal unitary transformation, enabling a simple and interpretable analysis of excitonic interactions. Using ethylene and pyrene dimers as model systems, we identify key effects of excitonic basis truncation and coupling approximations on excitation energies. We then extend the method to chlorophyll dimers, where weak CT asymmetries emerge due to geometric distortions. This framework offers a tractable route to analyze excitonic behavior in complex systems and paves the way for future fragment-based reconstruction of full exciton coupling matrices in large molecular assemblies.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Generating transition states of chemical reactions via distance-geometry-based flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms, yet their exploration is limited by the complexity of experimental and computational approaches. Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\% in structural accuracy. These predicted TSs provide high-quality initial structures, accelerating the convergence of CI-NEB optimization. Additionally, TS-DFM can identify alternative reaction paths. In our experiments, even a more favorable TS with lower energy barrier is discovered. Further tests on RGD1 dataset confirm its strong generalization ability on unseen molecules and reaction types, highlighting its potential for facilitating reaction exploration.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Infrared Laser Dissociation of Molecules with the Electromagnetic Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling bond breaking is a long-standing goal in molecular physics. Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary many-body wavefunctions for TDDFRT electronic excited states: Consequences for the representation of molecular electronic transitions</title>

Abstract: This contribution reports the study of a set of molecular electronic-structure reorganization representations related to light-induced electronic transitions, modeled in the framework of time-dependent density-functional response theory. More precisely, the work related in this paper deals with the consequences, for the electronic transitions natural-orbital characterization, that are inherent to the use of auxiliary many-body wavefunctions constructed a posteriori and assigned to excited states - since time-dependent density-functional response theory does not provide excited state ansatze in its native formulation. Three types of such auxiliary many-body wavefunctions are studied, and the structure and spectral properties of the relevant matrices (the one-electron reduced difference and transition density matrices) is discussed and compared with the native equation-of-motion time-dependent density functional response theory picture of an electronic transition - we see for instance that within this framework the detachment and attachment density matrices can be derived without diagonalizing the one-body reduced difference density matrix. The common ''departure/arrival'' wavefunction-based representations of electronic transitions are also extensively discussed.</description>

      <title>Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers' transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile, recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume that the carrier's hopping amplitude is modulated by a single undamped vibration. The modulation is, however, by many low-frequency modes, whose net effect can be approximated using a few effective damped oscillators. Here, we employ the dissipaton equations of motion (DEOM) method to compute the finite-temperature real-time current autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of the assumed delta-like phonon spectrum and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in describing experimental data.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Sustainable Refrigerants through Physics-Informed RL Fine-Tuning of Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.</description>

      <title>Linear Response Selected Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend selected configuration interaction (SCI) methods beyond energies and expectation values by introducing a linear response (LR) framework for molecular response properties. Existing SCI approaches are capable of approximating the energy of the full configuration interaction (FCI) wave function with high accuracy but at a much lower cost. However, conventional determinant selection will, by design, mainly select determinants that are expected to improve energies, and this can lead to the omission of many determinants that are important for wave function response. We address this by introducing two new selection criteria motivated by linear response theory. Using these extended determinant selection criteria, we demonstrate that LR-SCI can systematically converge toward the FCI limit for static polarizabilities. Using a damped LR formulation, we compute the water K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum in active spaces up to (10e, 58o). Finally, we use LR-SCI to compute NMR spin-spin coupling constants for water, where we find that accuracy beyond that offered by CCSDT can be achieved. Overall, LR-SCI offers a promising route to compute response properties with near-FCI accuracy to systems beyond the reach of exact FCI.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.</description>

      <title>Qumode-Based Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Molecular Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Qumode Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver (QSS-VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing molecular excited states using the Fock basis of bosonic qumodes in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices. This approach harnesses the native universal gate sets of qubit-qumode architectures to construct highly expressive variational ansatze, offering potential advantages over conventional qubit-based methods. In QSS-VQE, the electronic structure Hamiltonian is first mapped to a qubit representation and subsequently embedded into the Fock space of bosonic qumodes, enabling efficient state preparation and reduced quantum resource requirements. We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches. These results highlight the promise of leveraging bosonic degrees of freedom for enhanced quantum simulation of complex molecular systems.</description>
