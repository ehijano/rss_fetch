      <title>Arnoldi Singular Vector perturbations for machine learning weather prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, reliable decision making requires information on the likelihoods of future weather scenarios. We explore the sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h Pangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a specific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV) method does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to numerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth within a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast model to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly based on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each iteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are expected to turn into directions of growing errors. We show that A-SV indeed finds dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather model, which grow right from the beginning of the forecast rollout. These perturbations describe local unstable modes and could be a basis to initialize MLWP ensembles. Since we start A-SV from random noise perturbations, the algorithm transforms noise into perturbations conditioned on a given reference state - a process that is akin to the denoising process of the generic diffusion based ML model of GenCast, therefor we briefly discuss similarities and differences.</description>

      <title>Propagation of the Madden-Julian oscillation as a deterministic chaotic phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), a gigantic tropical weather system, is marked by eastward travel of cumulus cloud clusters over the Indo-Pacific region and often causes severe weather and climate events worldwide. The physics and predictability of MJO propagation remain elusive, partly because of little attention to untangling roles of multi-scale processes relevant to the MJO. Here, we reveal the chaotic nature of MJO propagation arising from cross-scale nonlinear interactions, based on 4,000-member ensemble global cloud-system-resolving simulations of two MJO events. Against conventional linearized thinking, multiple regimes with distinct timings of MJO propagation emerge under a single atmosphere-ocean background. The bifurcation emergence depends critically on the equatorial asymmetry of climatological sea surface temperature. Selection of the bifurcated regimes is probabilistic, influenced by whether tropical-extratropical interplay promotes moistening associated with westward-propagating tropical waves over the western Pacific. These aspects help build a comprehensive MJO model and foresee when the MJO propagates.</description>

      <title>A Pareto-Based Sensitivity Analysis and Multiobjective Calibration Approach for Integrating Streamflow and Evaporation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation is gaining increasing attention as a calibration and evaluation variable in hydrologic studies that seek to improve the physical realism of hydrologic models and go beyond the long-established streamflow-only calibration. However, this trend is not yet reflected in sensitivity analyses aimed at determining the relevant parameters to calibrate, where streamflow has traditionally played a leading role. On the basis of a Pareto optimization approach, we propose a framework to integrate the temporal dynamics of streamflow and evaporation into the sensitivity analysis and calibration stages of the hydrologic modeling exercise, here referred to as Pareto-based sensitivity analysis and multiobjective calibration. The framework is successfully applied to a case study using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model in three catchments located in Spain as representative of the different hydroclimatic conditions within the Iberian Peninsula. Several VIC vegetation parameters were identified as important to the performance estimates for evaporation during sensitivity analysis, and therefore were suitable candidates to improve the model representation of evaporative fluxes. Sensitivities for the streamflow performance, in turn, were mostly driven by the soil and routing parameters, with little contribution from the vegetation parameters. The multiobjective calibration experiments were carried out for the most parsimonious parameterization after a comparative analysis of the performance gains and losses for streamflow and evaporation, and yielded optimal adjustments for both hydrologic variables simultaneously. Results from this study will help to develop a better understanding of the trade-offs resulting from the joint integration of streamflow and evaporation data into modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Accurate Mediterranean Sea forecasting via graph-based deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting systems are essential for understanding marine dynamics, which play a crucial role in sectors such as shipping, aquaculture, environmental monitoring, and coastal risk management. Traditional numerical solvers, while effective, are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in machine learning have revolutionized weather forecasting, offering fast and energy-efficient alternatives. Building on these advancements, we introduce SeaCast, a neural network designed for high-resolution regional ocean forecasting. SeaCast employs a graph-based framework to effectively handle the complex geometry of ocean grids and integrates external forcing data tailored to the regional ocean context. Our approach is validated through experiments at a high horizontal resolution using the operational numerical forecasting system of the Mediterranean Sea, along with both numerical and data-driven atmospheric forcings. Results demonstrate that SeaCast consistently outperforms the operational model in forecast skill, marking a significant advancement in regional ocean prediction.</description>

      <title>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Thermal Inertia Controls on Titan's Surface Temperature and Planetary Boundary Layer Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL) -- the lowest region of the atmosphere influenced by surface conditions -- remains challenging due to Titan's thick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies have also produced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature, a critical determinant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in surface energy balance. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework and apply a three-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how surface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature variability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales, lower thermal inertia surfaces exhibit larger temperature swings and enhanced sensible heat fluxes due to inefficient subsurface heat conduction. In contrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations show weak sensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to dominate over subsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred meters to 1,000 m on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000--3,000 m, supporting the interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe captured the two PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens landing site successfully reproduce key observed features, including near-surface retrograde winds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest few kilometers, consistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. Simulations at the planned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal PBLs with broadly similar wind patterns. This work establishes a physically grounded framework for understanding Titan's surface temperature and boundary layer variability, and offers a unified explanation of Titan's PBL behavior that provides improved guidance for future missions.</description>

      <title>A composite of the effects of major sudden stratospheric warming events on carbon dioxide radiative cooling in the mesosphere-lower-thermosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events strongly influence the mean structure of the entire atmosphere, from the troposphere to the thermosphere. These events disrupt the compositional and thermal structure of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), causing spatiotemporal variations in the concentration of trace species of this region. Currently, the role of dynamical changes during SSW events on radiative cooling in the MLT region is not well understood. An investigation of the SSW-induced changes in CO$_2$ radiative cooling in the MLT region is presented by examining the changes in the dynamics and transport of key species, such as CO$_2$ and atomic oxygen (O). A composite analysis has been performed to understand these changes during the major SSW events that occurred between 2005 and 2020. The variation of trace species is found to be associated with the change in vertical residual circulation. The results also show that CO$_2$ radiative cooling decreases during the mesospheric cooling that occurs during the stratospheric warming over the polar region. During the recovery stage of the SSW event, the CO$_2$ radiative cooling enhances in the mesosphere. These variations in CO$_2$ radiative cooling are mainly caused by temperature perturbations and oxygen transport in the MLT region. The contribution of temperature change and transport have also been investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>On the possible role of condensation-related hydrostatic pressure adjustments in intensification and weakening of tropical cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that condensation and precipitation do not disturb the hydrostatic equilibrium if the local pressure sink (condensation rate expressed in pressure units) is proportional to the local pressure, with a proportionality coefficient $k$ that is independent of altitude. In the real atmosphere, condensation rate is controlled, among other factors, by the vertical velocity that can vary freely over height. This means that, in general, condensation disturbs hydrostatic equilibrium and thus causes pressure adjustments through redistribution of air masses. It is proposed that $k$ maximised in the upper atmosphere results in additional upward motion, which leads to cyclone strengthening. Conversely, $k$ maximised closer to the surface produces additional downward motion, which causes cyclone's weakening. The maximum scale of both effects should be set by the strength of the mass sink (precipitation). Using observational data, it is found that the mean intensification and weakening rates ($8$ and $6$ hPa~day$^{-1}$, respectively) in Atlantic tropical cyclones constitute about two thirds of their maximum concurrent precipitation (multiplied by gravity). This means that the storms intensify at {\it positive} vertically integrated air convergence -- a pattern impossible in modeled dry hurricanes -- with the pressure tendency being negative solely due to the fact that precipitation exceeds the vertically integrated moisture convergence by absolute magnitude. The implications of these results for recent studies evaluating the (de-)intensification process based on a mass continuity equation that neglects the mass sink are discussed.</description>

      <title>Refined climatologies of future precipitation over High Mountain Asia using probabilistic ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Mountain Asia (HMA) holds the highest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for future hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from 13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over HMA via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The MoE is trained and validated against gridded historical precipitation data, yielding 32% improvement over an equally-weighted average and 254% improvement over choosing any single ensemble member. This approach is then used to generate precipitation projections for the near future (2036-2065) and far future (2066-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared to previous estimates, the MoE projects wetter summers but drier winters over the western Himalayas and Karakoram and wetter winters over the Tibetan Plateau, Hengduan Shan, and South East Tibet.</description>

      <title>Supporting renewable energy planning and operation with data-driven high-resolution ensemble weather forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The planning and operation of renewable energy, especially wind power, depend crucially on accurate, timely, and high-resolution weather information. Coarse-grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large-scale forcing. We address these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a target wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An optimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with coarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained, full-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing numerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member, 10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min takes &lt; 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.</description>

      <title>NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation is critically important for marine research, yet remains challenging due to its substantial thermal inertia and extended time delay. Machine learning (ML)-based models have demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean simulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the slow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural ocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive graph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with ocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework tailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex dynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling relationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S and extreme event simulation. The codes are available at https://github.com/YuanGao-YG/NeuralOM.</description>
