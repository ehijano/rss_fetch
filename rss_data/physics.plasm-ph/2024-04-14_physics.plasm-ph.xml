      <title>Theoretical and Global Simulation Analysis of Collisional Microtearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into Microtearing Modes (MTMs) in tokamak plasmas, employing advanced simulations within the BOUT++ framework. The research, centering on collisional MTMs influenced by the time-dependent thermal force, enhances our understanding of plasma dynamics. It achieves this through the simplification and linearization of control equations in detailed linear simulations. The study meticulously evaluates various conductivity models, including those proposed by Larakers, Drake, and Hassam, under diverse plasma conditions and collision regimes. A notable achievement of this research is the derivation of a unified dispersion relation that encompasses both MTM and Drift-Alfven Wave (DAW) instabilities. It interestingly reveals that DAW and MTM exhibit instability at different proximities to the rational surface. Specifically, MTMs become unstable near the rational surface but stabilize farther away, whereas the drift-Alfven instability manifests away from the rational surface. Further, the study re-derives MTM dispersion relations based on Ohm's law and the vorticity equation, providing a thorough analysis of electromagnetic and electrostatic interactions in tokamaks. Global simulations demonstrate an inverse correlation between MTM growth rates and collisionality, and a direct correlation with temperature gradients. The nonalignment of the rational surface with the peak of electron local diamagnetic frequency stabilizes the MTMs. Nonlinear simulations highlight electron temperature relaxation as the primary saturation mechanism for MTMs, with magnetic flutter identified as the dominant mode of electron thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Role of nonlocal heat transport on the laser ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability (ARTI) and nonlocal heat transport are the critical problems in laser-driven inertial confinement fusion, while their coupling with each other is not completely understood yet. Here the ARTI in the presence of nonlocal heat transport is studied self-consistently for the first time theoretically and by using radiation hydrodynamic simulations. It is found that the nonlocal heat flux generated by the hot electron transport tends to attenuate the growth of instability, especially for short wavelength perturbations. A linear theory of the ARTI coupled with the nonlocal heat flux is developed, and a prominent stabilization of the ablation front via the nonlocal heat flux is found, in good agreement with numerical simulations. This effect becomes more significant as the laser intensity increases. Our results should have important references for the target designing for inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Anomaly Detection Disruption Prediction Starting from First Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma disruption presents a significant challenge in tokamak fusion, where it can cause severe damage and economic losses. Current disruption predictors mainly rely on data-driven methods, requiring extensive discharge data for training. However, future tokamaks require disruption prediction from the first shot, posing challenges of data scarcity during the early operation period. In this period disruption prediction aims to support safe exploration of operation range and accumulate necessary data to develop advanced prediction models. Thus, predictors must adapt to evolving plasma environments during this exploration phase. To address these issues, this study proposes a cross-tokamak adaptive deployment method using the Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder Anomaly Detection (E-CAAD) predictor, enabling disruption prediction from the first shot of new devices. Experimental results indicate the ability of E-CAAD model trained on existing devices to effectively differentiate between disruption precursors and non-disruption samples on new devices, proving the feasibility of model cross-device transfer. Building upon this, adaptive learning from scratch and threshold adaptive adjustment strategies are proposed to achieve model cross-device transfer. The adaptive learning from scratch strategy enables the predictor to use scarce data during the early operation of the new device while rapidly adapting to changes in operation environment. The threshold adaptive adjustment strategy addresses the challenge of selecting warning thresholds on new devices where validation set is lacking, ensuring that the warning thresholds adapt to changes in the operation environment. Finally, experiments transferring the model from J-TEXT to EAST exhibit comparable performance to EAST models trained with ample data, achieving a TPR of 85.88% and a FPR of 6.15%, with a 20ms reserved MGI system reaction time.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved investigations of a glow mode impulse dielectric barrier discharge in pure ammonia gas by means of E-FISH diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved electric field strength measurements have been performed, using an electric-field induced second harmonic (E-FISH) diagnostic, in a nanosecond glow discharge of an impulse dielectric barrier discharge (iDBD), in an ammonia gas environment. A temporal resolution of 2 ns and a spatial resolution estimated at 70 $\mu$m (given by laser waist) have been achieved. The comparative study of E-FISH measurements with and without a plasma discharge, operated at 4 kHz, reveal the presence of a persistent counter electric field, which is assumed to be caused by charge accumulation in between the AlN dielectrics used. Furthermore, by studying the influence of the applied voltage, the pressure, and the inter-dielectric distance, measurements seem to indicate the presence of charges remaining also in the post-discharge volume from the previous discharge to the next one.\&amp;\#xD;</description>

      <title>Nonlinear theory of the modulational instability at the ion-ion hybrid frequency and collapse of ion-ion hybrid waves in two-ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of two-dimensional nonlinear ion-ion hybrid waves propagating perpendicular to an external magnetic field in plasmas with two ion species. We derive nonlinear equations for the envelope of electrostatic potential at the ion-ion hybrid frequency to describe the interaction of ion-ion hybrid waves with low frequency acoustic-type disturbances. The resulting nonlinear equations also take into account the contribution of second harmonics of the ion-ion hybrid frequency. A nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained and, for a number of particular cases, the modulational instability growth rates are found. By neglecting the contribution of second harmonics, the phenomenon of collapse of ion-ion hybrid waves is predicted. It is shown that taking into account the interaction with the second harmonics results in the existence of a stable two-dimensional soliton.</description>

      <title>Applying Machine Learning Methods to Laser Acceleration of Protons: Lessons Learned from Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers in the field of ultra-intense laser science are beginning to embrace machine learning methods. In this study we consider three different machine learning methods -- a two-hidden layer neural network, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Process Regression -- and compare how well they can learn from a synthetic data set for proton acceleration in the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration regime. The synthetic data set was generated from a previously published theoretical model by Fuchs et al. 2005 that we modified. Once trained, these machine learning methods can assist with efforts to maximize the peak proton energy, or with the more general problem of configuring the laser system to produce a proton energy spectrum with desired characteristics. In our study we focus on both the accuracy of the machine learning methods and the performance on one GPU including the memory consumption. Although it is arguably the least sophisticated machine learning model we considered, Support Vector Regression performed very well in our tests.</description>
