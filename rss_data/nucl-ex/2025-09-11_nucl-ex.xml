      <title>Measurement of D$^0$ meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter reports the first measurement of photonuclear D$^0$ meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. The study is performed using lead-lead collision data, with an integrated luminosity of 1.38 nb$^{-1}$, collected by the CMS experiment at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.36 TeV. Photonuclear events, where one of the colliding nuclei breaks up and the other remains intact, are selected based on breakup neutron emissions and by requiring no particle activity in a large rapidity interval in the direction of the photon-emitting nucleus. The D$^0$ mesons are reconstructed via the D$^0$ $\to$ K$^-$$\pi^+$ decay channel, with the cross section measured as a function of D$^0$ meson transverse momentum and rapidity. The results are compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations that employ recent parametrizations of the lead nuclear parton distribution functions, as well as with predictions based on the color glass condensate framework. This measurement is the first photonuclear collision study characterizing parton distribution functions of lead nuclei for parton fractional momenta $x$ (relative to the nucleon) ranging approximately from a few 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-2}$ for different hard energy scale $Q^2$ selections.</description>

      <title>GUMP1.0 -- First global extraction of generalized parton distributions from experiment and lattice data with NLO accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first global extraction of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), GUMP1.0, by combining deeply virtual Compton scattering and $\rho$-meson production data from Jefferson Lab and Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator with global fits of parton distribution functions, charge form factors, and lattice quantum chromodynamics simulations. Using a conformal moment space parametrization, we achieve a unified description across low- and high-$x$ regions at next to leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative corrections. The results provide state-of-the-art GPDs consistent with almost all known facts, enabling three-dimensional nucleon imaging in impact parameter space and, at the same time, establishing a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of the nucleon structure.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Jet-Induced Medium Response with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark-gluon plasma (QGP), when viewed at length scales of order the inverse of its temperature, behaves as a strongly-coupled liquid. However, when it is probed with sufficiently high momentum transfer, asymptotic freedom mandates the presence of quark- and gluon-like quasi-particles. High energy partons within jets can trigger these high-momentum exchanges, making jets valuable probes for revealing the presence of such quasi-particles. Such elastic scatterings are implemented in the Hybrid Model, where a jet parton that scatters is deflected, kicking a medium parton, which recoils. Before and after a scattering, as one and then both partons propagate through the medium, they lose energy and momentum, exciting wakes in the QGP droplet. We use two-point and three-point energy-energy correlators (EECs) to reveal the relevant angular regions at which (modified) parton showers and wakes in the QGP each dominate, offering a new way with which to visualize and constrain the corresponding dynamics. We compare our calculations to recent CMS and ALICE measurements of two-point EECs of charged-particle tracks in jets produced in PbPb collisions. We show that our calculations are closest to the experimental measurements when elastic scattering is included and when the elastically scattered recoil-partons produce their own wakes. We also propose a new variant of the measurement that is especially sensitive to jet wakes.</description>

      <title>Wave-Breaking Phenomena in Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of wave-breaking in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC. A nonlinear longitudinal color field is coupled to a three-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic background constrained by experimental conditions: Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV (LHC) and Au-Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV (RHIC). The instantaneous wave-breaking threshold is determined from the in-medium plasma frequency, while the field evolution follows a nonlinear Landau equation with Debye screening and expansion damping. At the LHC, the higher initial temperature and density drive the system above the threshold within $\tau \lesssim $ 2.3 fm/$c$, whereas at RHIC the cooler and more dilute medium delays wave-breaking to $\tau \simeq 2.8$~fm/$c$. Scans over initial temperature, density, thermalization time, QGP lifetime, and collision system (RHIC vs LHC) confirm the robustness of this instability against parameter variations. These results identify wave-breaking as a universal microscopic mechanism for the early loss of coherence and rapid onset of hydrodynamics in the QGP, providing a common explanation for the fast equilibration observed at both RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive view of nuclear shapes, rotations and vibrations from fully quantum mechanical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear quadrupole collective states at low excitation energies are described in a novel, fully quantum mechanical and systematic manner as compared to traditional pictures initiated by Aage Bohr. The ellipsoidal shapes are shown to be triaxial in virtually all strongly deformed nuclei, in contrast to the Ansatz of axially symmetric shapes. The rotational bands of such triaxially deformed nuclei are described in a fully quantum mechanical way, i. e., without resorting to quantized free rotation of rigid body. The excitation energies within a rotational band, exhibiting the $J(J+1)$ dependence on angular momentum $J$, are shown to basically represent the change of binding energies due to nuclear forces. This differs from the interpretation \'a la Aage Bohr as rotational kinetic energies. The $K$ quantum numbers are shown to be practically conserved for triaxial ellipsoids, which turned out to be a real but positive surprise to many people in the field. The so-called $\gamma$ bands are shown to be $K$=2$^+$ rotations rather than $\gamma$-vibrations, leading to a nice description of the so-called $\gamma\gamma$ 4$^+$ state as a $K$=4$^+$ rotation. Vibrational modes are also shown to emerge in this study. Thus, the whole picture of low-energy quadrupole collective motion of heavy nuclei has been renewed in a fully quantum mechanical fashion, which differs from the traditional picture but appears to be simpler and more natural.</description>

      <title>Enhanced water Cherenkov detector for soil moisture detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work evaluates the ability of a water Cherenkov detector to measure thermal neutrons and explores its application to soil-moisture monitoring. We study a NaCl-doped detector and model its response to (i) monochromatic thermal neutrons and (ii) the natural thermal-neutron flux expected from dry soil at the elevation of Bucaramanga, Colombia. The ambient flux is estimated with the ARTI framework, and the detector response is simulated with MEIGA in Geant4. Doping with NaCl introduces additional capture channels on $^{35,37}\mathrm{Cl}$ and $^{23}\mathrm{Na}$; in particular, $^{35}\mathrm{Cl}$ has a thermal-neutron absorption cross section up to two orders of magnitude larger than hydrogen, boosting the capture signal. Our results indicate that water Cherenkov detectors can detect thermal neutrons with practical sensitivity under field conditions, enabling their integration into precision agriculture networks for soil moisture sensing. More broadly, this approach extends the cosmic-ray detection range of Cherenkov detectors using non-toxic, low-cost materials.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the Sn isotopes near the proton dripline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first $\textit{ab initio}$ lattice calculations of the proton-rich tin isotopes $^{99}$Sn to $^{102}$Sn using nuclear lattice effective field theory with high-fidelity two- and three-nucleon forces. For a given set of three-nucleon couplings, we reproduce binding energies with $\sim 1\%$ accuracy for the even-even systems, and obtain energy splitting and two-nucleon separation energies in agreement with experiment. Our results confirm the $N=50$ shell closure and reveal that the binding energy of $^{99}$Sn lies below values extrapolated from heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal anisotropies of charged particles with high transverse momentum in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement is presented of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) azimuthal anisotropy coefficients for charged particles produced in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $0.44$ nb$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2018. The values of $v_2$ and $v_3$ are measured for charged particles over a wide range of transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$), 1-400 GeV, and Pb+Pb collision centrality, 0-60%, using the scalar product and multiparticle cumulant methods. These methods are sensitive to event-by-event fluctuations and nonflow effects in the measurements of azimuthal anisotropies. Positive values of $v_2$ are observed up to a $p_{\text{T}}$ of approximately 100 GeV from both methods across all centrality intervals. Positive values of $v_3$ are observed up to approximately 25 GeV using both methods, though the application of the three-subevent technique to the multiparticle cumulant method leads to significant changes at the highest $p_{\text{T}}$. At high $p_{\text{T}}$ ($p_{\text{T}} \gtrapprox 10$ GeV), charged particles are dominantly from jet fragmentation. These jets, and hence the measurements presented here, are sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

Abstract: Deuteron inelastic scattering on $^{86}$Kr was measured in inverse kinematics with the gaseous active target CAT-M, as part of a systematic investigation aimed at determining the nuclear matter incompressibility. The isoscalar monopole strength distribution was extracted via multipole decomposition analysis, and the energy of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance was determined to be 17 $\pm$ 1 MeV. The nuclear incompressibility of $^{86}$Kr and the isospin-dependent term of the nuclear matter incompressibility are discussed.</description>
