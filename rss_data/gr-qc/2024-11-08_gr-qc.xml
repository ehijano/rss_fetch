      <title>Self-consistent multidimensional Penrose process driven by magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical observations and numerical simulations are providing increasing evidence that resistive effects in plasmas around black holes play an important role in determining the phenomenology observed from these objects. In this spirit, we present a general approach to the study of a Penrose process driven by plasmoids that are produced at reconnection sites along current sheets. Our formalism is meant to determine the physical conditions that make a plasmoid-driven Penrose process energetically viable and can be applied to scenarios that are matter- or magnetic-field-dominated, that is, in magnetohydrodynamical or force-free descriptions. Our approach is genuinely multidimensional and hence allows one to explore conditions that are beyond the ones explored so far and that have been restricted to the equatorial plane, thus providing a direct contact with numerical simulations exhibiting an intense reconnection activity outside the equatorial plane. Finally, our analysis does not resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the dynamics of the plasma or adopts oversimplified and possibly unrealistic models to describe the kinematics of the plasma. On the contrary, we study the dynamics of the plasma starting from a well-known configuration, that of an equilibrium torus with a purely toroidal magnetic field whose "ergobelt", i.e. the portion penetrating the ergosphere, naturally provides a site to compute, self-consistently, the occurrence of reconnection and estimate the energetics of a plasmoid-driven Penrose process.</description>

      <title>Identifying Eccentricity in Binary Black Hole mergers using a Harmonic Decomposition of the Gravitational Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the gravitational waveform emitted by a binary on an eccentric orbit can be naturally decomposed into a series of harmonics. The frequencies of these harmonics depend upon the radial frequency, $f_{\mathrm{r}}$, determined by the time to return to apoapsis, and the azimuthal frequency, $f_{\phi}$, determined by the time to complete one orbit relative to a fixed axis. These frequencies differ due to periapsis advance. Restricting to the (2, 2) multipole, we find that the frequencies can be expressed as $f = 2 f_{\phi} + k f_{\mathrm{r}}$. We introduce a straightforward method of generating these harmonics and show that the majority of the signal power is contained in the $k= -1, 0, 1$ harmonics for moderate eccentricities. We demonstrate that by filtering these three leading harmonics, we are able to obtain a good estimate of the orbital eccentricity from their relative amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Unmodeled, Source-dependent Signals in Gravitational Waves with SCoRe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New physics and systematic errors can lead to deviations between the models used to analyze gravitational wave data and the actual signal. Such deviations will generally be correlated between detectors and manifest differently across the gravitational wave source parameter space. The previously introduced \ttt{SCoRe} framework uses these features to distinguish these deviations from noise and extract physical information from their source-dependent variation. In this work, we further analyze the hierarchical component of the method -- we include the expected dependence of the deviations on the source parameters into the inference process, obtaining more physically informative results. As a specific example, we study a deviation that scales as a power law of the mass scale of black hole binaries -- as, for example, in Effective Field Theory of gravity. We show how the signal-to-noise ratio of the cross-correlated residual power can be used to recover the power-law index. We demonstrate how both the distribution in source and deviation strength determine which region of source parameter space influences the inference most. Finally, we forecast the constraint on the power law index for a network of two Cosmic Explorer-like detectors with a year of observation period.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>Stability of Neutron Star and Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the equation for pressure within a neutron star, taking into account a non-zero cosmological constant ($\Lambda$). We then examine the stability of the neutron star's equilibrium state in the presence of cosmological constant. Our analysis shows that the theorem used to assess the stability of stellar structures at equilibrium remains applicable to neutron stars even when a cosmological constant is considered. We further numerically solve the stellar structure equations and determine the mass of neutron star using different equations of state (EOS). Moreover, we observe that the value of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda \geq 10^{-11} \rm m^{-2}$) causes a significant change in the mass-radius relationship of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Frame-dragging effects in the gravitational quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogous to magnetism in electrodynamics, it is gravitomagnetism in relativistic gravity. Since gravity determines locally inertial frames, in general relativity (GR) and other relativistic theories of gravity, frame-dragging with source motion plays key role in gravitomagnetism. Recently, Wu has put forward a gauge theory of gravity, called the gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) with the gravitational force and the spin gauge force described by the gauge fields. Gao {\it et al.} ({\it Phy. Rev. D 109, 064072}) have derived the Shapiro time delay in the GQFT and give an empirical constraint from Cassini experimental result on the dimensionless GQFT parameter $\gamma_W$ to be $(2.1\pm 2.3)\times 10^{-5}$. In this work, we derive the frame-dragging Lense-Thirring effects in the GQFT. The current precision of LARES-LAGEOS Lense-Thirring measurement gives a constraint on $|\gamma_W|$ to be less than $2\times 10^{-2}$. This constraint is consistent with but subdominant to the Cassini experimental constraint. As a candidate of quantum gravity, we do not expect that the deviation from the GR value ($\gamma_W=0$) is large classically. With the launch of LARES 2, the precision of Lense-Thirring measurement is expected to increase by one order of magnitude in a couple of years. As to the Shapiro effect, current technologies have the capability to measure the $\gamma_W$ parameter to precision of $10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>New approach to search for long transient gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for gravitational waves generated by the inspiral phase of binaries of light compact objects holds significant promise in testing the existence of primordial black holes and/or other exotic objects. In this paper, we present a new method to detect such signals exploiting some techniques typically applied in searches for continuous quasi-monochromatic gravitational waves. We describe the signal model employed and present a new strategy to optimally construct the search grid over the parameter space investigated, significantly reducing the search computing cost. Additionally, we estimate the pipeline sensitivity corroborating the results with software injections in real data from the LIGO third observing run. The results show that the method is well suited to detect long-transient signals and standard continuous gravitational waves. According to the criteria used in the grid construction step, the method can be implemented to cover a wide parameter space with slightly reduced sensitivity and lower computational cost or to focus on a narrower parameter space with increased sensitivity at a higher computational expense. The method shows an astrophysical reach up to the Galactic Center (8kpc) for some regions of the parameter space and given search configurations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of self-gravitating fluid spheres involving ghost stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact solutions are presented which describe, either the evolution of fluid distributions corresponding to a ghost star (vanishing total mass), or describing the evolution of fluid distributions which attain the ghost star status at some point of their lives. The first two solutions correspond to the former case, they admit a conformal Killing vector (CKV) and describe the adiabatic evolution of a ghost star. Other two solutions corresponding to the latter case are found, which describe evolving fluid spheres absorbing energy from the outside, leading to a vanishing total mass at some point of their evolution. In this case the fluid is assumed to be expansion-free. In all four solutions the condition of vanishing complexity factor was imposed. The physical implications of the results, are discussed</description>

      <title>Unruh-deWitt detector in impulsive plane wave spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the response function of an inertial Unruh-deWitt detector in an impulsive plane wave spacetime. Through symmetry considerations applied to the Wightman function, we demonstrate that the response function remains invariant for any inertial detector, even for those experiencing a discontinuous lightcone coordinate shift after interacting with the shockwave. This implies that the vacuum state in an impulsive plane wave spacetime is preserved under the associated spacetime symmetries. Additionally, we confirm that the quantum imprint of the shockwave, as discussed in [J. High Energ. Phys. 2021, 54 (2021)], is not an artifact and exhibits a distinct characteristic form. We identify this form by defining a "renormalized" response function for an eternally inertial detector, with Minkowski spacetime as a reference.</description>

      <title>Properties of an axisymmetric Lorentzian non-commutative black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we start by examining a spherically symmetric black hole within the framework of non-commutative geometry and apply a modified Newman-Janis method to obtain a new rotating solution. We then investigate its consequences, focusing on the horizon structure, ergospheres, and the black hole's angular velocity. Following this, a detailed thermodynamic analysis is performed, covering surface gravity, Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also study geodesic motion, with particular emphasis on null geodesics and their associated radial accelerations. Additionally, the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadows are explored. Finally, we compute the quasinormal modes for scalar perturbations using the 6th-order WKB approximation.</description>

      <title>Quintessence phase of the late-time Universe in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the late-time accelerating expansion of the Universe using the matter-geometry coupled $ f(Q, T) $ gravity model, where $ Q $ is the non-metricity scalar and $ T $ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We constrain the best-fit values of cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \alpha_0~\mbox{and}~ \beta_0$ through the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation {using 31 Hubble parameter data points from cosmic chronometers (CC) and 26 data points from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), making a total of 57 datasets (labeled \texttt{CC+BAO}), as well as SNIa distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon+ sample, which consists of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct supernovae (labeled \texttt{Pantheon +SHOES}), and their combination (labeled \texttt{CC+BAO+Pantheon +SHOES)}}. {We compare our constrained Hubble constant $H_0$ value with different late-time and early-time cosmological measurements.} Deceleration {parameter} \(q(z)\), effective equation of state parameters \(w_{eff}(z)\), Hubble parameter $H(z)$, and distance modulus \(\mu(z)\) are numerical results of dynamical quantities that show that the $f(Q, T)$ gravity model is compatible with a transition towards a quintessence-like phase in the late-time. In conformity with \(\Lambda\)CDM, we moreover take into account the geometrical interpretations by considering the state-finder parameters \(r-s\) and \(r-q\), which are crucial parameters for additional analysis. Additionally, the statistical analysis has been carried out for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Primordial power spectrum from an objective collapse mechanism: The simplest case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyzed the physical origin of the primordial inhomogeneities during the inflation era. The proposed framework is based, on the one hand, on semiclassical gravity, in which only the matter fields are quantized and not the spacetime metric. Secondly, we incorporate an objective collapse mechanism based on the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model, and we apply it to the wavefunction associated with the inflaton field. This is introduced due to the close relation between cosmology and the so-called ``measurement problem'' in Quantum Mechanics. In particular, in order to break the homogeneity and isotropy of the initial Bunch-Davies vacuum, and thus obtain the inhomogeneities observed today, the theory requires something akin to a ``measurement'' (in the traditional sense of Quantum Mechanics). This is because the linear evolution driven by Schr\"odinger's equation does not break any initial symmetry. The collapse mechanism given by the CSL model provides a satisfactory mechanism for breaking the initial symmetries of the Bunch-Davies vacuum. The novel aspect in this work is that the constructed CSL model arises from the simplest choices for the collapse parameter and operator. From these considerations, we obtain a primordial spectrum that has the same distinctive features as the standard one, which is consistent with the observations from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking To GR in SO(4,2) Gravitational Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Yang-Mills type gauge theory of gravity based on the conformal group SO(4,2) coupled to a conformally invariant real scalar field. The goal is to generate fundamental dimensional constants via spontaneous breakdown of the conformal symmetry. In the absence of other matter couplings the resulting theory resembles Weyl-Einstein gravity, {with the Newton constant given by the square of the (constant) vacuum expectation value of the scalar, the cosmological constant determined by the quartic coupling constant of the scalar field and the Weyl to Einstein transition scale determined by the Yang-Mills coupling constant.} The emergent theory in the long-wave-length limit is Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. As an illustrative example we present an exact spherically symmetric cosmological solution with perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor that reduces to $\Lambda$FRW in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>A note on the conversion of orbital angles for extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a practical scheme for converting between three commonly used sets of phases to describe the trajectories of extreme mass ratio inspirals; quasi-Keplerian angles, Mino time action-angles, and Boyer-Lindquist time action-angles (as utilised by the FastEMRIWaveform package). Conversion between Boyer-Lindquist time action angles and quasi-Keplerian angles is essential for the construction of a source frame for adiabatic inspirals that can be related to the source frames used by other gravitational wave source modelling techniques. While converting from quasi-Keplerian angles to Boyer-Lindquist time action angles via Mino time action-angles can be done analytically, the same does not hold for the converse, and so we make use of an efficient numerical root-finding method. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by comparing two calculations for an eccentric and inclined geodesic orbit in Kerr spacetime using two different sets of orbital angles. We have made our implementations available in Mathematica, C, and Python.</description>

      <title>Light-cone actions and correlators of self-dual theories in AdS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-dual Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity in Euclidean AdS$_4$ are useful toy models because they can be described by simple scalar Lagrangians exhibiting a new manifestation of the colour/kinematics duality, as recently shown by two of the authors. In this paper, we clarify how the self-dual sectors fit into the full theories. In particular, we explicitly construct the light-cone action for Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity in AdS$_4$ in terms of positive and negative helicity fields, where we are able to pinpoint the self-dual sector as expected. We then show that the boundary correlators of these theories take a remarkably simple form in terms of Feynman diagrams in half of flat space, acted on by certain differential operators. We also analyse their soft limits and show that they exhibit Weinberg-like soft factors, where the soft pole which appears in scattering amplitudes is replaced by a derivative with respect to the energy.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity in large $N$ field theories and performance of quantum tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field theories exhibit dramatic changes in the structure of their operator algebras in the limit where the number of local degrees of freedom ($N$) becomes infinite. An important example of this is that the algebras associated to local subregions may not be additively generated in the limit. We investigate examples and explore the consequences of this ``superadditivity'' phenomenon in large $N$ field theories and holographic systems. In holographic examples we find cases in which superadditive algebras can probe the black hole interior, while the additive algebra cannot. We also discuss how superaddivity explains the sucess of quantum error correction models of holography. Finally we demonstrate how superadditivity is intimately related to the ability of holographic field theories to perform quantum tasks that would naievely be impossible. We argue that the connected wedge theorems (CWTs) of May, Penington, Sorce, and Yoshida, which characterize holographic protocols for quantum tasks, can be re-phrased in terms of superadditive algebras and use this re-phrasing to conjecture a generalization of the CWTs that is an equivalence statement.</description>

      <title>Background ambiguity and the G\"odel double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the assumptions regarding spacetime backgrounds underlying the classical double copy. We argue (contrary to the norm) that single-copy fields naturally constructed on the original curved background metric are only interpretable on a flat metric when such a well-defined limit exists, for which Kerr--Schild coordinates offer a natural choice. As an explicit example where such a distinction matters, we initiate an exploration of single-copies for the G\"odel universe. This metric lacks a (geodesic) Kerr--Schild representation yet is Petrov type-D, meaning the technology of the ``Weyl double copy" may be utilized. The Weyl derived single copy has many desirable features, including matching the defining properties of the spacetime, and being sourced by the mixed Ricci tensor just as Kerr--Schild single copies are. To compare, we propose a sourced flat-space single-copy interpretation for the G\"odel metric by leveraging its symmetries, and find that this proposal lacks the defining properties of the spacetime, and is not consistent with the flat limit of our curved-space single copy. Notably, this inconsistency does not occur in Kerr--Schild metrics. Our curved-space single copy also lead to the same electromagnetic analogue of the G\"odel universe found separately through tidal force analogies, opening a new avenue of exploration between the double copy and gravitoelectromagnetism programs.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution generated by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which produces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Via the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamic profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for these states, valid across a wide parameter range and at all time scales. Additionally, we show how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific regions of the energy spectrum in the semi-classical limit.
  We reformulate the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Using this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and examine the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also consider finite-temperature effects, showing how operator spreading slows as temperature decreases.
  In the semi-classical limit, we apply a saddle point analysis and include the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction mirrors the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we analyze the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown by Danielson-Satishchandran-Wald (DSW) that for the massive or charged body in a quantum spatial separated superposition state, the presence of a black hole can decohere the superposition inevitably towards capturing the radiation of soft photons or gravitons. In this work, we study the DSW decoherence effect for the static charged body in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By calculating the decohering rate for this case, it is shown that the superposition is decohered by the low frequency photons that propagate through the black hole horizon. For the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the decoherence of quantum superposition is completely suppressed due to the black hole Meissner effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a second realization of the Weyl double copy (WDC) in four-dimensional algebraic type D spacetime. We show that any type D vacuum solution admits an algebraically general Maxwell scalar on the curved background that squares to give the Weyl scalar. The WDC relation defines a scalar field that satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation sourced by the Weyl scalar on the curved background. We then extend the type D WDC to five dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ultra slow-roll inflation in a black hole background finding a correspondence between scalar solutions of ultra slow-roll inflation and quasi-normal modes of the cosmological black hole spacetime. Transitions from slow-roll to ultra slow-roll can enhance the peak of the primordial power spectrum increasing the likelihood of primordial black hole formation. By following such a transition in a black hole background, we observe a decay of the slow-roll attractor solution into the quasi-normal modes of the system. With a large black hole, the ringing modes dominate, which could have implications for the background of cosmological scalar perturbations and peak enhancement.</description>

      <title>Dark energy constraints using gamma-ray burst correlations with DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) mission does not exclude a dynamical dark energy evolution, the concordance paradigm, i.e., the $\Lambda$CDM model, remains statistically favored, as it depends on the fewest number of free parameters. In this respect, high redshift astrophysical sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, represent a formidable tool to model the form of dark energy, since they may provide a link between early and local redshift regimes. Hence, the use of these objects as possible distance indicators turns out to be essential to investigate the cosmological puzzle. To this end, we adopt two gamma-ray burst linear correlations, namely the $L_p-E_p$ and $L_0-E_p-T$ relations, to test the flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM, $\omega_0$CDM, and $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM cosmological models, i.e., those directly examined by the DESI collaboration. The inferred correlation coefficients and cosmological parameters are thus obtained by considering two independent Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, the first considering the whole DESI data set and the second excluding a seemingly problematic data point placed at $z_{eff} = 0.51$. Using model selection criteria, the two above correlations do not show a preference on a precise cosmological model although, when the data point at $z_{eff}$ is included, the concordance paradigm appears to be the least favored among the tested cosmological models.</description>

      <title>On Gravity Implication in the Wavefunction Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by an ontic view of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics and motivated by the universal interaction of gravity, we discuss a possible gravity implication in the state collapse mechanism. Concretely, we investigate the stability of the spatial superposition of a massive quantum state under the gravity effect. In this context, we argue that the stability of the spatially superposed state depends on its gravitational self-energy originating from the effective mass density distribution through the spatially localized eigenstates. We reveal that the gravitational self-interaction between the different spacetime curvatures created by the eigenstate effective masses leads to the reduction of the superposed state to one of the possible localized states. Among others, we discuss such a gravity-driven state reduction. Then, we approach the corresponding collapse time and the induced effective electric current in the case of a charged state, as well as the possible detection aspects.</description>

      <title>Dark energy reconstructions combining BAO data with galaxy clusters and intermediate redshift catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological parameters and dark energy (DE) behavior are generally constrained assuming \textit{a priori} models. We work out a model-independent reconstruction to bound the key cosmological quantities and the DE evolution. Through the model-independent \textit{B\'ezier interpolation} method, we reconstruct the Hubble rate from the observational Hubble data and derive analytic expressions for the distances of galaxy clusters, type Ia supernovae, and uncorrelated baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. In view of the discrepancy between Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data, they are kept separate in two distinct analyses. Correlated BAO data are employed to break the baryonic--dark matter degeneracy. All these interpolations enable us to single out and reconstruct the DE behavior with the redshift $z$ in a totally model-independent way. In both analyses, with SDSS-BAO or DESI-BAO data sets, the constraints agree at $1$--$\sigma$ confidence level (CL) with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The Hubble constant tension appears solved in favor of the Planck satellite value. The reconstructed DE behavior exhibits deviations at small $z$ ($&gt;1$--$\sigma$ CL), but agrees ($&lt;1$--$\sigma$ CL) with the cosmological constant paradigm at larger $z$. Our method hints for a slowly evolving DE, consistent with a cosmological constant at early times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Ward identities of a Carrollian CFT stress tensor at null infinity reproduce the leading and subleading soft graviton theorems for massless scattering in the bulk. We deduce the expressions of the stress tensor components in terms of the bulk radiative modes, and these components turn out to be local at $\mathscr{I}$ in terms of the twistor potentials. This analysis makes the correspondence between the large-time limit of Carrollian amplitudes and the soft limit of momentum space amplitudes manifest. We then construct Carrollian CFT currents from the ascendants of the hard graviton operator, which satisfy the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We show that the large-time limit of their Ward identities implies an infinite tower of projected soft graviton theorems in the bulk, while their finite-time OPEs encode the collinear limit of scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: During this work, it is considered a binary system of supermassive rotating black holes; first, it is employed the concept of weak field limit to develop a metric tensor g that describes the geometry of the spacetime, it introduced an approximation in which the second black hole is coupled to the system through a perturbation tensor f, consequently , it is employed a black hole type Sagittarius A to make the numerical calculations; the negative Ricci scalar curvature states that the tensor f does not change the topological properties of Kerr solution. From the metric tensor developed and the scalar of curvature the geodesic trajectories are derived; they determine an orbit with a perigee of 116.4AU and an apogee of 969.67AU, the orbit has a precession of 77.8 seconds per year; and the precession is determined by the rotation of the black holes besides the angular momentum that is the classical parametrization; finally, the average energy is defined by the equation E, this expression parametrizes the energy per orbit in function of the rotation of the black holes, this value is one order of magnitude higher than Newtonian energy</description>

Abstract: We explore the relationship between linear and non-linear causality in theories of dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics. While for some fluid-dynamical theories, a linearized causality analysis can be used to determine whether the full non-linear theory is causal, for others it can not. As an illustration, we study relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics supplemented by a neutral-particle current, with resistive corrections to the conservation of magnetic flux. The dissipative theory has 10 transport coefficients, including anisotropic viscosities, electric resistivities, and neutral-particle conductivities. We show how causality properties of this magnetohydrodynamic theory, in the most general fluid frame, may be understood from the linearized analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for Galactic binary gravitational waves is a critical challenge for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. We propose an innovative approach to simultaneously explore gravitational waves originating from Galactic binaries by developing a new Local Maxima Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO) algorithm. Our method identifies local maxima in the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic and applies astrophysical models and the properties of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic within parameter space to uncover Galactic binary gravitational wave signals in the dataset. This new approach effectively addresses the inaccuracies often associated with signal subtraction contamination, a challenge for traditional iterative subtraction methods, particularly when dealing with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals (e.g., SNR $&lt;$ 15). We also account for the effects of overlapping signals and degeneracy noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we use residuals from the LISA mock data challenge (LDC1-4), where 10,982 injected sources with SNR $\ge$ 15 have been removed. For the remaining low-SNR sources (SNR $&lt;$ 15), our method efficiently identifies 6,508 signals, achieving a 63.2\% detection rate.</description>

Abstract: We try to find the possibility of a Bianchi V universe in the modified gravitational field theory of $f(R,T)$. We have considered a Lagrangian model in the connection between the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$ and the Ricci scalar $R$. In order to solve the field equations a power law for the scaling factor was also considered. To make a comparison of the model parameters with the observational data, we put constraints on the model under the datasets of the Hubble parameter, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Pantheon, joint datasets of Hubble parameter + Pantheon, and collective datasets of the Hubble parameter + Baryon Acoustic Oscillations + Pantheon. The outcomes for the Hubble parameter in the present epoch are reasonably acceptable, especially since our estimation of this $H_0$ is remarkably consistent with various recent Planck Collaboration studies that utilize the $\Lambda$-CDM model.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

Abstract: New one parameter family of exact solutions in General Relativity with a scalar field is found. The metric is of Liouville type which admits complete separation of variables in the geodesic Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This solution exists for the exponential potential for a scalar field and is invariant with respect to global Lorentz transformations. It describes, in particular, evolution of the space-time with the naked singularity. Solutions corresponding to the naked singularity provide accelerating expansion of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe, and can be smoothly continued along geodesics to infinite past without Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from a Kerr Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection within the Plunging Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection within a highly magnetized plasma has been seen as a viable mechanism to extract the energy from a rotating black hole, as it can generate negative energy plasmoids in the ergoregion. For a typical accreting black hole, the ergoregion is filled with bulk plasma plunging from the innermost-stable-circular orbit (ISCO). In this study, we present an analytical study of the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. In contrast to the toroidal plasma, where the magnetic field cannot be derived from the MHD scheme, the magnetic field in the plunging plasma was determined by the ideal-MHD condition. We derive the global magnetic field structure in a fast reconnection model, and we read the expressions for the energies of plasmoids ejected from the reconnection region, for general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes. Then, we demonstrate the behaviors of ejected energies varying with the reconnection locations in the Kerr spacetime, and identify the region where a negative-energy plasmoid can be produced. We find that for a certain magnetization there exists a critical value of the black hole spin, beyond which the energy extraction can occur, and the energy extraction is most efficient for the near-extreme black hole. Moreover, we study the conditions necessary for a plasmoid with positive energy to escape to the infinity, a crucial requirement for effective energy extractions. Considering the escaping conditions, we provide the parameter space in the radius-spin plane in which the energy extraction mechanism is effective.</description>

      <title>Spin wave optics for gravitational waves lensed by a Kerr black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves exhibit the unique signature of their spin-2 nature in processes of wave scattering, due to the interaction between spin and a background spacetime. Since the spin effect is more pronounced for longer wavelengths and gravitational waves sourced by binaries have a long wavelength, it may become an important effect in addition to the wave effect. We study the propagation of gravitational waves lensed by a Kerr black hole by numerically solving the Teukolsky equation with a source term of the equal-mass circular binary, taking into account both spin effect and wave effect. We find helicity-dependent small-period oscillation in the power spectrum of the amplification factor in the forward direction and the oscillation is enhanced as spin of a prograde Kerr black hole increases.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in modified $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity: a late time cosmic phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method for numerically solving the Friedmann equations of modified $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity in the presence of pressureless matter. This method enables us to predict the redshift behaviour of the Hubble expansion rate. To evaluate the credibility of the model, we applied a Bayesian MCMC technique using late-time cosmic observations to impose limitations on the free parameters of the Gauss-Bonnet model. Our results suggest that the $f(\mathcal{G})$ model can reproduce the low-redshift behaviour of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, but there are significant differences at high redshifts, leading to the absence of a standard matter-dominated epoch. We also examined the profiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the standard range to verify the intermediate epochs. Our analysis shows that the highly promising $f(\mathcal{G})$ model is a feasible candidate for explaining the current epochs. We presented a dynamical system analysis framework to examine the stability of the model. Our study identified critical points depicting various phases of the Universe and explained the evolutionary epochs. We demonstrated that the model effectively captures the evolution of energy components over cosmic time, supporting its validity as an alternate explanation for the observed acceleration of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Resolving FLRW cosmology through effective equations of state in $f(T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores the cosmological scenario of the universe in the context of the $f(T)$ power law model, where $T$ represent the torsion scalar. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations we parametrized the effective Equation-of-State with two parameters $m$ and $k$ as suggested by A. Mukherjee in a flat FLRW environment. We impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solution by utilizing MCMC analysis assuming the $CC, Pantheon+SH0ES$, and $CC+Pantheon+SH0ES$ as data samples. We explore the dynamics of cosmological parameters. The evolutionary profile of the deceleration parameter exhibits the transition %from the decelerated to the accelerated phase. The effective Equation-of-State parameter indicates the model remains in the quintessence era and gradually becomes the Einsteins-de-Sitter model. In addition to this, we also explore the jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. Furthermore, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows that the model has a consistent positive slope across the entire evolution, but resembles the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future. At last, we conclude that the power law function of the modified $f(T)$ gravity model in the framework of the FLRW universe aligns more closely with the $\Lambda$CDM model for given observational data.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: the plunging bulk plasma and orientation angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconection provides a new avenue to extract energy from a rotating black hole in astrophysical scenarios. There have been many works studying the feasibility of extracting energy via magnetic reconnection in the scheme of magnetohydrodynamics. However, most of them focused on circularly flowing bulk plasma only, and the influence of orientation angle, the angle between flowing direction of bulk plasma and ejection direction of plasmoids, was never carefully considered. In this work, we would like to study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, via the so-called Comisso-Asenjo process specifically, in the plunging plasma. More importantly, we analyze the influence of orientation angle in depth. Actually, we consider the magnetic reconnection occurring in bulk plasma with two kinds of streamlines, one being the circular flow and the other being the plunging flow from the ISCO. We find that the plunging plasma has higher energy-extraction efficiency. Moreover, we notice that it is favorable for energy extraction when the orientation angle is suitably increased if the bulk plasma plunges. We further define the covering factor. Under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection occurs equally probable along any direction on any position within ergosphere, this value help us to primitively judge the probability of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, through which we conclude that the plunging bulk plasma is much more capable in energy extraction than the circularly flowing one.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Mode Couplings in Rotating Black Holes and Their Detectability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic quasinormal modes encode fundamental properties of black hole spacetimes. They are also one of the key ingredients of nonlinearities of General Relativity in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence. In this work, we classify all possible quadratic coupling channels of quasinormal modes for a generic Kerr black hole, and use a frequency-domain pseudospectral code with hyperboloidal slicing to calculate these couplings. After accounting for all the channels in systems with reflection symmetry, our results become consistent with those extracted from numerical simulations and time-domain fits. We explore several observationally relevant quadratic modes and their detectability with third-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer, as well as the space-borne detector LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). We find that several quadratic modes are detectable by both detectors. In addition, we make a theoretical prediction for how the signal-to-noise ratio of a quadratic quasinormal mode depends on the properties of progenitor binaries, offering insight into selecting golden events in future ringdown data analyses.</description>

      <title>Merging L-shaped resonator with Michelson configuration for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves in kilohertz frequency range is crucial for understanding the physical processes of binary neutron star mergers. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021019 (2023)], a new interferometric configuration has been proposed, employing an L-shaped optical resonant cavity as arm cavity. This alteration enhances the detector's response to kHz signals. However, the departure from conventional Michelson configuration necessitates a redesign of its sensing and control scheme, which is currently under study. In this article, we propose replacing linear arm cavities in the conventional Michelson by the L-shaped resonator. This hybrid configuration features an enhanced response at kHz while retaining the same sensing and control scheme as the Michelson setup. At the conceptual level, it exhibits higher sensitivity in the 2-4 kHz range compared to existing configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. The demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The lesson for the Unruh effect is discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>

      <title>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>

      <title>One-loop Gravitational Bremsstrahlung and Waveforms from a Heavy-Mass Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06111v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a heavy-mass effective field theory (HEFT), we study gravitational-wave emission in the scattering of two spinless black holes or neutron stars of arbitrary masses at next-to-leading order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion. We compute the contributions to the one-loop scattering amplitude with four scalars and one graviton which are relevant to the calculation of the waveforms, also presenting expressions of classical tree-level amplitudes with four scalars and up to two radiated gravitons. The latter are obtained using a novel on-shell recursion relation for classical amplitudes with four scalars and an arbitrary number of gravitons. Our one-loop five-point amplitude is expressed in terms of a single family of master integrals with the principal value prescription for linearised massive propagators, which we evaluate using differential equations. In our HEFT approach all hyper-classical iterations and quantum corrections to the amplitude are dropped at the diagrammatic level, thereby computing directly contributions to classical physics. Our result exhibits the expected factorisation of infrared divergences, the correct soft limits, and highly nontrivial cancellations of spurious poles. Finally, using our amplitude result we compute numerically the corresponding next-to-leading corrections to the spectral waveforms and the far-field time-domain waveforms using the Newman-Penrose scalar $\Psi_4$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on ultra-slow-roll inflation with the NANOGrav 15-Year Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-slow-roll~(USR) inflation predicts an exponential amplification of scalar perturbations at small scales, which leads to a stochastic gravitational wave background~(SGWB) through the coupling of the scalar and tensor modes at the second-order expansion of the Einstein equation. In this work, we search for such a scalar-induced SGWB from the NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) dataset, and find that the SGWB from USR inflation could explain the observed data. The Bayes factors are $54\pm 5$ for the USR inflation model alone and $68\pm 6$ for the combined USR inflation plus supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) models. We place constraints on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum to $P_{\mathrm{Rp}} &gt; 10^{-1.95}$ at $95\%$ confidence level (C.L.) at the scale of $k\sim 20\, \mathrm{pc}^{-1}$. We find that $\log_{10} P_{\mathrm{Rp}}$ degenerates with the peak scale $\log_{10} k_{\mathrm{p}}$. We also obtain the parameter space allowed by the data in the USR inflationary scenario, where the $e$-folding numbers of the duration of the USR phase has a lower limit $\Delta N &gt; 2.80$ ($95\%$ C.L.) when the USR phase ends at $N\approx 20$. With astrophysically motivated priors, the NG15 dataset fits both the USR inflation model and SMBHB model equally well.</description>

      <title>Precession and Split of Tilted, Geometrically Thin Accretion Disk: an Analytical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been observed that many relativistic jets display a kind of cork-screw-like precession. Numerical simulations has suggested that such kind of precession may originate from the precession of the disk. In this work, we introduce an analytical model to describe the precession and split of a tilted, geometrically thin disk. We consider the Lense-Thirring effect from the central (primary) black hole (BH) and the gravitational effect from the companion (secondary) BH far away from the center, both of which could induce the precession of the accretion disk around the spin axis of central black hole. We propose the splitting conditions that when the rate of viscous diffusion cannot catch up with the dynamical frequency at a certain layer of fluid, the disk would split into two parts which precess independently. We presume that the precessions of the inner and outer disks are in accord with the rotation and precession of jet, respectively. By matching the frequencies of the disks to the observed frequencies of jet in the cork-screw-like precession and considering the splitting condition, we are allowed to read four parameters, the innermost radius ($r_{\rm in}$), the outermost radius ($r_{\rm out}$) of the disk, the initial splitting radius ($r_{\rm sp,0}$), and the inflow speed magnitude($\beta$), of the disk. We apply this model to OJ 287. Moreover, considering the inward shrinking of the disks, we find the time variation of the precession angle of jet. This time variation presents a unique feature of our model, which could be distinguishable in the future observation.</description>

      <title>Effects of local cosmic inhomogeneities on the gravitational wave event rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local universe is highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic. We live in a relatively sparse region of the Laniakea supercluster at the edge of a large 80 Mpc-wide void. We study the effect of these inhomogeneities on the measured gravitational wave event rates. In particular, we estimate how the measured merger rate of compact binaries is biased by the local matter distribution. The effect of the inhomogeneities on the merger rate is suppressed by the low angular resolution of gravitational wave detectors coupled with their smoothly decreasing population-averaged sensitivity with distance. We estimate the effect on the compact binary coalescence event rate to be at most 6% depending of the chirp mass of the target binary system and the sensitivity and orientation of the detectors.</description>

      <title>Fewer supermassive binary black holes in pulsar timing array observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the inferred properties of the putative gravitational wave background in the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) to be in better agreement with theoretical expectations under the improved noise model. In particular, if the gravitational wave background is from supermassive black hole binaries, the observed gravitational wave emission is the dominant source of the binary energy loss, with no evidence of environmental effects, eccentric orbits, or an overabundance of sources. Our improved noise model addresses the misspecification of noise priors which impacts the inference of temporal correlations of the background. We also find evidence for epoch-correlated temporally-uncorrelated (white) noise which has a stronger impact on the measurement in the presence of Hellings-Downs correlations of the background.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>
