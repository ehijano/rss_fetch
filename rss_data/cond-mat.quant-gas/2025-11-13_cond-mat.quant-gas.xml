      <title>Probing short-range gravity using quantum reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reflection occurs when ultra-cold atoms are incident on a material surface with sufficiently low velocity. The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-droplet interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose atom interferometers based on quantum droplet (QD), which is also being reported as a superior platform for interferometry. The emphasis has been given to harmonic-oscillator (HO) or ring-shaped potentials. In the HO trap, a Gaussian barrier induces coherent splitting; in the ring, one or two barriers guide the splitting and subsequent recombination. The atom number and relative mean-field interaction strength critically affect the interferometric performance. The transmission-coefficient analysis identifies values of the barrier parameters for the balanced $50:50$ splitting. The post-recombination atom-number imbalance serves as a sensitive indicator of the relative phase between merging daughter QDs. We demonstrate that the HO-based setup may serve as a tilt-meter and target detector, and the ring geometry may be used as a compact QD Sagnac interferometer for rotation sensing.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-induced Quantum Hall Criticality in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that static disorder is indispensable to the integer quantum Hall effect, underpinning both quantized plateaus and the plateau-plateau transition. We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $\theta$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $\sigma$ model (NL$\sigma$M) for class A with a topological $\theta$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$. Evaluating $\theta$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $\sigma_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $\sigma_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps. By establishing dephasing as a self contained route to Hall criticality, our framework reframes plateau physics in open solid state and cold atom platforms and offers practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Thermal Reservoirs with Tunable Temperature in a Trapped-Ion Spin-Boson Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</description>

      <title>Cold-Atom Buoy: A Differential Magnetic Sensing Technique in Cold Quadrupole Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a technique for vectorial magnetic sensing using a cold-atom cloud trapped in a magnetic quadrupole. The center of the trapped cloud is determined by absorption imaging and compared for opposite polarities of the quadrupole. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the displacement of the cloud depends on both the field's direction and magnitude. By analyzing this shift under polarity reversal, we infer the two transverse components of a homogeneous external magnetic field relative to the imaging axis, without requiring spectroscopic interrogation. Assuming micron-scale position sensitivity and typical magnetic field gradients, the method enables resolution at the milli-Gauss level. It is compatible with standard cold-atom setups and offers a practical tool for field compensation in magnetically sensitive experimental stages. As such, it establishes a bridge between traditional macroscopic magnetic field probes and atomic-physics-based precision sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and superconductivity is reviewed. The thermodynamic principle for superfluid flow and the equation of motion for condensed bosons are given. Computer simulations of Lennard-Jones $^4$He give the $\lambda$-transition and the superfluid viscosity. The statistical mechanical theory of high-temperature superconductivity is presented. Critical comparison is made with older approaches, such as ground energy state condensation, irrotational superfluid flow, and the macroscopic wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of room-temperature exciton condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton condensation--an interaction-driven, macroscopically coherent paired-fermion state--offers the prospect for dissipationless energy transport in solids, akin to that in superconductivity. Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg arrays, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal weight superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single-mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>
