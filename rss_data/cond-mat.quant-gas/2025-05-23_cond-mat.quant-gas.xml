      <title>Comment on "Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Y. Ma and X. Cui, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043402 (2025)), a new type of shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate with a self-bound character has been proposed, made of three-component $Na^{23}K^{39}K^{41}$ Bose mixture (species (1,2,3) in the following), where the mixtures (1, 2) and (2, 3) both form quantum droplets. The proposed structures are made of an outer shell of liquid (1,2) enveloping a spherical core of (2,3) liquid, which is claimed to be stable without the need of any trapping potential. I comment in the following that these structures are not actually the ground-states solutions to the system but rather local energy minima, and most likely impossible to realize in practice.</description>

      <title>Major issues in theory of Bose-Einstein condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major issues arising in the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation are reviewed. These issues, although being principally important, are very often misunderstood, which results in wrong conclusions. The basic point is global gauge symmetry breaking that is a necessary and sufficient condition for Bose-Einstein condensation. Paying no attention to this basic point is a common fallacy leading to a number of confusions. For instance, the attempt of describing Bose condensation without gauge symmetry breaking produces the so-called ``grand canonical catastrophe" that actually does not exist in the correct description of Bose condensation accompanied by gauge symmetry breaking. The other common flaw is forgetting to consider the stability of the studied systems. One sometimes accomplishes lengthy calculations and discusses the properties of a system that in reality cannot exist being unstable. In some cases, the seeming instability is caused by the negligence of the simple mathematical reason teaching us that one should not go beyond the approximation applicability. An example of such an artificial instability is related to the appearance of the so-called ``thermodynamically anomalous fluctuations" whose arising is due to the use of a second-order approximation for calculating fourth-order terms, in this way distorting the $O(2)$-class model of a Bose-condensed system to the Gaussian-class model. These and other principal points, important for the correct treatment of Bose-condensed systems, are reviewed, including the resolution of the Hohenberg-Martin dilemma of gapless versus conserving theories for Bose-condensed systems and the problem of statistical ensemble equivalence.</description>

      <title>Probing Superfluidity with Quantum Vortex Necklaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for measuring the superfluid fraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) without relying on external perturbations or imposed optical lattices. Our approach leverages the intrinsic rotation of vortex necklaces in one component of a binary superfluid mixture, where the vortex cores act as effective potential wells for the second component. The rotation of the vortex necklace transfers angular momentum to the latter, enabling a direct determination of its effective moment of inertia. Comparing this value with its classical counterpart allows us to extract the superfluid fraction, which we find to be precisely bracketed by the Leggett bounds. By increasing intercomponent interactions, the second component undergoes a crossover from a delocalized and fully superfluid state to an insulating state consisting of a regular array of localized density peaks. Furthermore, the dynamical instability of vortex necklaces provides a natural framework for investigating superfluidity in dynamically evolving and disordered landscapes.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in exotic lattice geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern quantum engineering techniques allow for synthesizing quantum systems in exotic lattice geometries, from self-similar fractal networks to negatively curved hyperbolic graphs. We demonstrate that these structures profoundly reshape Bose-Einstein condensation. Fractal lattices dramatically lower the condensation temperature, while hyperbolic lattices cause it to increase as the system grows - a behavior not seen in ordinary two-dimensional arrays, where the condensation temperature vanishes in the large-size limit. The underlying geometry also controls condensate fluctuations, enhancing them on fractal networks but suppressing them on hyperbolic graphs compared with regular one-dimensional or two-dimensional lattices. When strong repulsive interactions are included, the gas enters a Mott insulating state. A multi-site Gutzwiller approach finds a smooth interpolation between the characteristic insulating lobes of one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Re-entrant Mott transitions are seen within a first-order resummed hopping expansion. Our findings establish lattice geometry as a powerful tuning knob for quantum phase phenomena and pave the way for experimental exploration in photonic waveguide arrays and Rydberg-atom tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases, Criticality, and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phases of matter are conventionally distinguished from one another by local observables. Topological quantum phases lie outside this paradigm; their differences can only be learned by examining them globally. This has striking implications for the stability of these phases, their classification, and the phase transitions between them. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate these implications using interacting magnetic erbium atoms in an optical lattice. We show that a Mott insulator and a pinned charge-density wave in one dimension are in distinct crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). The quantum phase transition separating them is revealed by measuring nonlocal string order parameters using site-resolved imaging. Remarkably, stacking two copies of these states eliminates the critical point -- a signature feature of topological phases that underlies their classification. Moreover, we show that while a programmable symmetry-breaking disorder pattern can also remove this critical point, averaging over disorder restores it, supporting recent theoretical predictions of mixed-state order. Finally, we highlight a connection between one of these CSPTs and the Haldane insulator, and detect signatures of the transition between the Haldane and the Mott insulator. Our results establish a path toward probing broader symmetry-protected topology and mixed-state order in programmable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions and Quantum Defect Theory for van der Waals Potentials in Ultracold Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have provided exact two-body solutions to the 2D and 3D Schr\"odinger equations with isotropic van der Waals potentials of the form \(\pm 1/r^6\). Based on these solutions, we developed an analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) applicable to both quasi-2D and 3D geometries, and applied it to study the scattering properties and bound-state spectra of ultracold polar molecules confined in these geometries. Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Neural Operator Approach for Modelling Exciton-Polariton Condensate Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plethora of next-generation all-optical devices based on exciton-polaritons have been proposed in latest years, including prototypes of transistors, switches, analogue quantum simulators and others. However, for such systems consisting of multiple polariton condensates, it is still challenging to predict their properties in a fast and accurate manner. The condensate physics is conventionally described by Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs). While GPU-based solvers currently exist, we propose a significantly more efficient machine-learning-based Fourier neural operator approach to find the solution to the GPE coupled with exciton rate equations, trained on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed method predicts solutions almost three orders of magnitude faster than CUDA-based solvers in numerical studies, maintaining the high degree of accuracy. Our method not only accelerates simulations but also opens the door to faster, more scalable designs for all-optical chips and devices, offering profound implications for quantum computing, neuromorphic systems, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Semisuper Efimov effect induced by resonant pair exchange in mixed dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new member to the class of semisuper Efimov effects, where an infinite number of bound states emerge with their binding energies obeying the universal scaling law $E_n\sim e^{-2(\pi n/\gamma)^2}$ for sufficiently high excitation $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Our system consists of a pair of two-component fermions in three dimensions at infinite scattering length, which furthermore interact with a boson confined in two dimensions so as to form a three-body bound state at zero energy. When another boson is added, the exchange of the resonant pair of fermions between two bosons leads to the semisuper Efimov effect of four such particles with the scaling exponent $\gamma$ determined by the mass ratio of bosons to fermions. If bosons exist in three dimensions, an infinite number of bound states do not emerge, but some of them may survive for a large mass ratio, making our findings potentially relevant to two-neutron halo nuclei as well as ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Anomaly Indicators of (2+1)-D Fermionic Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical proposal for the anomaly indicators of symmetries of (2+1)-d fermionic topological orders, and work out the consequences of our proposal in several nontrivial examples. Our proposal is an invariant of a super modular tensor category with a fermionic group action, which gives a (3+1)-d topological field theory (TFT) that we conjecture to be invertible; the anomaly indicators are partition functions of this TFT on $4$-manifolds generating the corresponding twisted spin bordism group. Our construction relies on a bosonization construction due to Gaiotto-Kapustin and Tata-Kobayashi-Bulmash-Barkeshli, together with a ``bosonization conjecture'' which we explain in detail. In the second half of the paper, we discuss several examples of our invariants relevant to condensed-matter physics. The most important example we consider is $\mathbb{Z}/4^T\times \mathbb{Z}/2^f$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^FC$, which many fermionic topological orders enjoy, including the $\mathrm{U}(1)_5$ spin Chern-Simons theory. Using newly developed tools involving the Smith long exact sequence, we calculate the cobordism group that classifies its anomaly, present the generating manifold, and calculate the partition function on the generating manifold which serves as our anomaly indicator. Our approach allows us to reproduce anomaly indicators known in the literature with simpler proofs, including $\mathbb{Z}/4^{Tf}$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^F$, and other symmetry groups in the 10-fold way involving Lie group symmetries.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian for a Bose gas with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian for a three-dimensional Bose gas of $N \geq 3$ spinless particles interacting via zero-range (also known as contact) interactions. Such interactions are encoded by (singular) boundary conditions imposed on the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide.
  It is well known that imposing the same kind of boundary conditions as in the two-body problem with a point interaction leads to a Hamiltonian unbounded from below (and thus unstable). This is due to the fact that the interaction becomes overly strong and attractive when the coordinates of three or more particles coincide.
  In order to avoid such instability, we develop a suggestion originally formulated by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962, introducing slightly modified boundary conditions that weaken the strength of the interaction between two particles $i$ and $j$ in two scenarios: (a) a third particle approaches the common position of $i$ and $j$; (b) another distinct pair of particles approach each other. In all other cases, the usual boundary condition is restored.
  Using a quadratic form approach, we construct a class of Hamiltonians characterized by such modified boundary conditions, that are self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also compare our approach with the one developed years ago by Albeverio, H{\o}egh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys., 18, 907--917, 1977). In particular, we show that the $N$-body Hamiltonian defined by Albeverio et al. is a special case of our class of Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we also introduce a Dirichlet form by considering a more general weight function, and we prove that the corresponding $N$-body Hamiltonians essentially coincide with those constructed via our method.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>
