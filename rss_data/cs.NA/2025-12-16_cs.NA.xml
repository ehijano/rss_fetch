      <title>Discrete-to-continuum convergence of the density of states for Mathieu's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density of states of a self-adjoint operator generalizes the eigenvalue distribution of a Hermitian matrix. We prove convergence of the density of states for a tight-binding model with a slowly-varying periodic potential to the density of states of its continuum approximation, a Mathieu-type equation.</description>

      <title>An unfitted divergence-free higher order finite element method for the Stokes problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper develops and analyzes a higher-order unfitted finite element method for the incompressible Stokes equations, which yields a strongly divergence-free velocity field up to the physical boundary. The method combines an isoparametric Scott--Vogelius velocity-pressure pair on a cut background mesh with a stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation for imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct finite element spaces that admit robust numerical implementation using standard elementwise polynomial mappings and produce exactly divergence-free discrete velocities. The key components of the analysis are a new inf-sup stability result for the isoparametric Scott--Vogelius pair on unfitted meshes and a combined inf-sup stability result for the bilinear forms associated with the pressure and the Lagrange multiplier. The finite element formulation employs a higher-order Lagrange multiplier space, which ensures stability and mitigates the loss of pressure robustness typically associated with the weak enforcement of boundary conditions for the normal velocity component.
  The paper provides a complete stability and convergence theory in two dimensions, accounting for the geometric errors introduced by the isoparametric approximation. The analysis demonstrates optimal-order velocity convergence in both the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms and establishes optimal $H^1$-convergence and nearly optimal $L^2$-convergence of a post-processed pressure. Numerical experiments illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Beam Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network models are used as efficient representation of materials with complex, interconnected locally one-dimensional structures. They typically accurately capture the mechanical properties of a material, while substantially reducing computational cost by avoiding full three-dimensional resolution. Applications include the simulation of fiber-based materials, porous media, and biological systems such as vascular networks. This article focuses on two representative problems: a stationary formulation describing the elastic deformation of beam networks, and a time-dependent formulation modeling elastic wave propagation in such materials. We propose a two-level additive domain decomposition method to efficiently solve the linear system associated with the stationary problem, as well as the linear systems that arise at each time step of the time-dependent problem through implicit time discretization. We present a rigorous convergence analysis of the domain decomposition method when used as a preconditioner, quantifying the convergence rate with respect to network connectivity and heterogeneity. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the mechanical properties of commercial-grade paperboard.</description>

      <title>An explicit integrator uniform in the true anomaly and exactly preserving all integrals of motion in the three-dimensional Kepler problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical scheme for the Kepler problem that preserves exactly all first integrals: angular momentum, total energy, and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. This property ensures that orbital trajectories retain their precise shape and orientation over long times, avoiding the spurious precession typical of many standard methods. The scheme uses an adaptive time step derived from a constant angular increment. Analytical considerations and numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm combines high accuracy with long-term stability.</description>

      <title>$C^1$-$Q_k$ serendipity finite elements on rectangular meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $C^1$-$Q_k$ serendipity finite element is a sub-element of $C^1$-$Q_k$ BFS finite element such that the element remains $C^1$-continuous and includes all $P_k$ polynomials. In other words, it is a minimum of $Q_k$ bubbles enriched $P_k$ finite element. We enrich the $P_4$ and $P_5$ spaces by $9$ $Q_4$ and $11$ $Q_5$-bubble functions, respectively. For all $k\ge 6$, we enrich the $P_k$ spaces exactly by $12$ $Q_k$ bubble functions. We show the uni-solvence and quasi-optimality of the newly defined $C^1$-$Q_k$ serendipity elements. Numerical experiments by the $C^1$-$Q_k$ serendipity elements, $4\le k\le 8$, are performed.</description>

      <title>Local discontinuous Galerkin method for the integral fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for solving integral fractional Laplacian problems on bounded Lipschitz domains. The method is based on a three-field mixed formulation involving the primal variable, its gradient, and the corresponding Riesz potential, yielding a flux-based structure well suited for LDG discretizations while retaining the intrinsic nonlocal interaction. A key ingredient of our analysis is a rigorous study of the weighted H\"older and Sobolev regularity of the Riesz potential, which enables accurate characterization of boundary singularities. Guided by these regularity results, we propose LDG schemes on quasi-uniform and graded meshes, with additional stabilization in the graded case to reconcile the discrepancy between the discrete spaces for the Riesz potential and flux fields. Optimal a priori error estimates are established, and numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation method for wave scattering in periodic structures via the Floquet-Bloch transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of an acoustic wave scattering in a locally perturbed periodic structure. As the total wavefield is non-quasi-periodic, effective truncation techniques are pursued for high-accuracy numerical solvers. We adopt the Green's function for the background periodic structure to construct a boundary integral equation (BIE) on an artificial curve enclosing the perturbation. It serves as a transparent boundary condition (TBC) to truncate the unbounded domain. We develop efficient algorithms to compute such background Green's functions based on the Floquet-Bloch transform and its inverse. Spectrally accurate quadrature rules are developed to discretize the BIE-based TBC. Effective algorithms based on leap and pullback procedures are further developed to compute the total wavefield everywhere in the structure. A number of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new solver. They exhibit that our method for the non-quasi-periodic problem has a time complexity that is even comparable to that of a single quasi-periodic problem.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Coarse Basis by Randomised SVD: the Helmholtz Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillatory waves require sufficient degrees of freedom to resolve. That restriction usually applies also to coarse problems for Schwarz methods. The resulting coarse problem is then too large. To address the issue, a new form of Schwarz methods with coarse correction is proposed for the Helmholtz problem. There are two components in the proposed form: randomised SVD of interface iteration, and hierarchical domain decomposition. The resulting coarse problem is hierarchical and can be solved in a decoupled way at each level of hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Kernel interpolation in Sobolev spaces of hybrid regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel interpolation in tensor product reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces allows for the use of sparse grids to mitigate the curse of the dimension. Typically, besides the generic constant, only a dimension dependent power of a logarithm term enters here into complexity estimates. We show that optimized sparse grids can avoid this logarithmic factor when the interpolation error is measured with respect to Sobolev spaces of hybrid regularity. Consequently, in such a situation, the complexity of kernel interpolation does not suffer from the curse of dimension.</description>

      <title>Newton Methods for Mean Field Games: A Numerical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the numerical solution of second-order Mean Field Game problems through Newton iterations in infinite dimensions, introduced in [14], where quadratic convergence of the method was rigorously established. Building upon this theoretical framework, we develop new numerical discretization techniques, including both a finite difference and a semi-Lagrangian scheme, that enable an effective computational implementation of the infinite-dimensional iterations.
  The proposed methods are tested on several benchmark problems, and the resulting numerical experiments demonstrate their robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. A comparative analysis between the two schemes and existing approaches from the literature is also presented, highlighting the potential of Newton-based solvers for MFG systems.</description>

      <title>Fast capacity computation for maze-like configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conformal capacity ${\rm cap}(\Omega,K)$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $K$ is a compact connected set in $\Omega$. Because the exact numerical value of the capacity is known only in a handful of special cases, it is important to find estimates for the capacity in terms of domain functionals, simpler than the capacity itself. Here, we study condensers of maze-like structure and compute their capacity by means of a high-order $hp$- finite element method. We compare these numerical results to the estimates given by the quasihyperbolic length and perimeter of the compact set. In particular, we consider the behaviour of these value pairs, numerical results and estimates, when the structure parameters vary and the walls of the maze approach the compact set. Over the configurations covered in the numerical experiments, the quasihyperbolic estimates are shown to have the desired asymptotic properties and superior computational efficiencies once the case-specific analysis is completed.</description>

      <title>Sharp convergence bounds for sums of POD and SPOD weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the convergence of sums of the form $S_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(m)=\sum_{v\subseteq \mathbb{N}}\gamma_v m^{|v|}$, where $\gamma_v$ are product and order dependent (POD) weights. We establish that for nonnegative sequence $\{\Upsilon_j\mid j\in \mathbb{N}\}$, $$\sum_{v\subseteq \mathbb{N}} |v|! m^{|v|}\prod_{j\in v} \Upsilon_j&lt;\infty \text{ for } m&gt;0 \text{ if and only if } \sum_{j=1}^\infty \Upsilon_j&lt;\infty.$$ We further characterize the growth of $S_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(m)$ when $\gamma_v=(|v|!)^{\sigma}\prod_{j\in v}j^{-\rho}$ and prove that $\log S_{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(m)$ exhibits asymptotic order $m^{1/(\rho-\sigma)}$ when $\rho&gt;\sigma$. All results are subsequently generalized to smoothness-driven product and order dependent (SPOD) weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study within-host HIV dynamics using a three--component nonlinear ordinary differential equation model for healthy CD4$^{+}$ T cells, infected CD4$^{+}$ T cells, and free virus. In addition to the baseline model without treatment, we consider two treatment extensions that incorporate antiretroviral therapy: (i) separate efficacy terms for Reverse Transcriptase inhibitors and Protease inhibitors acting on infection and virus production, and (ii) a simplified formulation using a single combined efficacy parameter. For each model we determine equilibrium points and apply linearization to obtain the Jacobian matrix and local stability conditions near equilibrium. We perform numerical simulations using the classical fourth--order Runge--Kutta method to illustrate the evolution of cell populations and viral load under different therapy levels and treatment start times, including continuous treatment scenarios. The simulations highlight how therapy strength and timing shape transient behavior and can lead to sustained viral suppression.</description>

      <title>q-Analogue of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon Lagrangian mechanics on Wess's $q$-commutative spaces, we derive the $q$-deformed Hamiltonian dynamics as formulated by Lavagno et al. (2006). We then develop a computationally tractable scheme and propose a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler ($q$-HMC). The proposed $q$-HMC method is shown to satisfy the detailed balance principle. Numerical experiments on distributions with explicit potential functions demonstrate its efficacy, particularly in exploring stiff energy landscapes. This method is also applied to draw samples from the Bayesian posterior distribution of inverse problems. The numerical test for the posterior distribution with stiff potential further shows the advantage of $q$-HMC. And it yields the identical computational implementation process to that of HMC when used to deal with functional reconstruction problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sets of fixed CP, multilinear, and TT rank tensors, and derive conditions for when (the smooth parts of) these sets are smooth homogeneous manifolds. For CP and TT ranks, the conditions are essentially that the rank is sufficiently low. These homogeneous structures are then used to derive Riemannian metrics whose geodesics are both complete and efficient to compute.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning Techniques for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Discretizations on GPU Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present scalable iterative solvers and preconditioning strategies for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs) on graphics processing units (GPUs). The HDG method is implemented using GPU-tailored algorithms in which local element degrees of freedom are eliminated in parallel, and the globally condensed system is assembled directly on the device using dense-block operations. The global matrix is stored in a block format that reflects the natural HDG structure, enabling all iterative solver kernels to be executed with strided batched dense matrix-vector multiplications. This implementation avoids sparse data structures, increases arithmetic intensity, and sustains high memory throughput across a range of meshes and polynomial orders. The nonlinear solver combines Newton's method with preconditioned GMRES, integrating scalable preconditioners such as block-Jacobi, additive Schwarz domain decomposition, and polynomial smoothers. All preconditioners are implemented in batched form with architecture-aware optimizations--including dense linear algebra kernels, memory-coalesced vector operations, and shared-memory acceleration--to minimize memory traffic and maximize parallel occupancy. Comprehensive studies are conducted for a variety of PDEs (including Poisson equation, Burgers equation, linear and nonlinear elasticity, Euler equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) using structured and unstructured meshes with different element types and polynomial orders on both NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures.</description>

      <title>Torus Time-Spectral Method for Quasi-Periodic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic trajectories with two or more incommensurate frequencies are ubiquitous in nonlinear dynamics, yet the classical Fourier-based time-spectral method is tied to strictly periodic responses. We introduce a torus time-spectral method that lifts the governing equations to an extended angular phase space, applies double-Fourier collocation on the invariant torus, and solves for the state. The formulation exhibits spectral convergence for quasi-periodic problem which we give a rigorous mathematical proof and also verify numerically. We demonstrate the approach on Duffing oscillators and a nonlinear Klein-Gordon system, documenting spectral error decay on the torus and tight agreement with time-accurate integrations while using modest frequency grids. The method extends naturally to higher-dimensional tori and offers a computationally efficient framework for analyzing quasi-periodic phenomena in fluid mechanics, plasma physics, celestial mechanics, and other domains where multi-frequency dynamics arise.</description>

      <title>Irregular Stanley sequences plausibly do not have growth $\Theta(n^2/\log n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stanley sequences starting from the set $\{0, n\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer have long been conjectured to be divided into two types: the "regular" type where the growth rate is $\Theta(n^{\log_2(3)})$, and the "irregular" type where the growth rate is thought to be $\Theta(n^2/\log n)$. A paradigmatic case of a candidate irregular type is $n=4$, although to date no value of $n$ has been proven to have such a growth rate. Here, we provide strong numerical evidence against this conjectured growth rate for $n=4$. Specifically, for $n=4$, it seems plausible that the upper bound is $O(n^2/\log n)$ but that the lower bound is in fact $\Omega(n^{2-\delta})$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$. This appears to be because the sequence is not totally "random" as has been assumed. Limitations of the numerical method here is discussed.</description>

      <title>HWF-PIKAN: A Multi-Resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for solving Collisionless Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more recently Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) have emerged as promising approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without reliance on extensive labeled data. In this work, we propose a novel multi-resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier-Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HWF-PIKAN) for solving advection problems based on collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) with both continuous and discontinuous initial conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions. These tests demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture smooth and abrupt features. We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed. This study highlights the power of multi-resolution spectral feature embeddings in advancing physics-informed deep learning frameworks for complex kinetic equations in both space-time and phase-space.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Cumulant Expansion and Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Weakly Interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function of weakly interacting fermions with polynomial runtime in both the system size and precision. Although weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for many computational methods such as the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, a mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime has been lacking. In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework demonstrating that SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) activation networks achieve exponential approximation rates for smooth functions with explicit and improved complexity control compared to classical ReLU-based constructions. We develop a novel hierarchical construction beginning with an efficient approximation of the square function $x^2$ more compact in depth and size than comparable ReLU realizations, such as those given by Yarotsky. This construction yields an approximation error decaying as $\mathcal{O}(\omega^{-2k})$ using networks of depth $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We then extend this approach through functional composition to establish sharp approximation bounds for deep SiLU networks in approximating Sobolev-class functions, with total depth $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and size $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/n})$.</description>

      <title>Solving a Machine Learning Regression Problem Based on the Theory of Random Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a machine learning regression problem as a multivariate approximation problem using the framework of the theory of random functions. An ab initio derivation of a regression method is proposed, starting from postulates of indifference. It is shown that if a probability measure on an infinite-dimensional function space possesses natural symmetries (invariance under translation, rotation, scaling, and Gaussianity), then the entire solution scheme, including the kernel form, the type of regularization, and the noise parameterization, follows analytically from these postulates. The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle. This result provides a theoretical foundation for a broad class of smoothing and interpolation methods, demonstrating their optimality in the absence of a priori information.</description>

      <title>On the variational dual formulation of the Nash system and an adaptive convex gradient-flow approach to nonlinear PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of base states on the consistency of the dual variational formulation for quadratic systems of PDEs, which are not necessarily conservative (typical examples include the noise-free Nash system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and multiple players). We identify a sufficient condition under which consistency holds over large time intervals. In particular, in the single-player case, there exists a sequence of base states (each exhibiting full consistency) that converges in mean to zero. We also prove existence of variational dual solutions to the noise-free Nash system for arbitrary base states. Furthermore, we propose a scheme based on Hilbertian gradient flows that, starting from an arbitrary base state, generates a sequence of new base states that is expected to converge to a solution of the original PDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13336v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Knowledge-Distilled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (KD-PINN), a framework that transfers the predictive accuracy of a high-capacity teacher model to a compact student through a continuous adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In order to confirm its generality for various dynamics and dimensionalities, the framework is evaluated on a representative set of partial differential equations (PDEs). Across the considered benchmarks, the student model achieves inference speedups ranging from x4.8 (Navier-Stokes) to x6.9 (Burgers), while preserving accuracy. Accuracy is improved by on the order of 1% when the model is properly tuned. The distillation process also revealed a regularizing effect. With an average inference latency of 5.3 ms on CPU, the distilled models enter the ultra-low-latency real-time regime defined by sub-10 ms performance. Finally, this study examines how knowledge distillation reduces inference latency in PINNs, to contribute to the development of accurate ultra-low-latency neural PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>DP-EMAR: A Differentially Private Framework for Autonomous Model Weight Repair in Federated IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, but model weight distortion remains a major challenge in resource constrained IoT networks. In multi tier Federated IoT (Fed-IoT) systems, unstable connectivity and adversarial interference can silently alter transmitted parameters, degrading convergence. We propose DP-EMAR, a differentially private, error model based autonomous repair framework that detects and reconstructs transmission induced distortions during FL aggregation. DP-EMAR estimates corruption patterns and applies adaptive correction before privacy noise is added, enabling reliable in network repair without violating confidentiality. By integrating Differential Privacy (DP) with Secure Aggregation (SA), the framework distinguishes DP noise from genuine transmission errors. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT sensor and graph datasets show that DP-EMAR preserves convergence stability and maintains near baseline performance under communication corruption while ensuring strict (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantees. The framework enhances robustness, communication efficiency, and trust in privacy preserving Federated IoT learning.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical solution of conservation laws in the two dimensional case using a novel compact implicit time discretization that enables applications of fast algebraic solvers. We present details for the second order accurate parametric scheme based on the finite volume method including simple variants of ENO (Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) approximations. To avoid oscillatory numerical solutions for large time steps, we propose limiting in time which is provable non-oscillatory in the case of linear advection equation with variable velocity.

      <description>arXiv:2410.06322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a fully-mixed formulation for the coupled problem arising in the interaction between a free fluid and a poroelastic medium.The flows in the free fluid and poroelastic regions are governed by the Navier-Stokes and Biot equations, respectively, and the transmission conditions are given by mass conservation, balance of stresses, and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman law.We apply dual-mixed formulations in both Navier-Stokes and Darcy equations, where the symmetry of the Navier-Stokes pseudostress tensor is imposed in a weak sense and a displacement-based formulation for elasticity equation.In turn, since the transmission conditions are essential in the fully mixed formulation, they are imposed weakly by introducing the traces of the fluid velocity and the poroelastic medium pressure on the interface as the associated Lagrange multipliers.Existence and uniqueness of a solution are established for the continuous weak formulation, as well as a semidiscrete continuous-in-time formulation with nonmatching grids, in a Banach space setting, employing classical results on monotone and nonlinear operators and a regularization technique together with the Banach fixed point approach.We then present error analysis with corresponding rates of convergence for semidiscrete continuous-in-time formulation.Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical rates of convergence and illustrate the performance of the method for application to flow through a filter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new spatial semidiscrete multiscale method based upon the edge multiscale methods to solve semilinear parabolic problems with heterogeneous coefficients and smooth initial data. This method allows for a cheap spatial discretization, which fails to resolve the spatial heterogeneity but maintains satisfactory accuracy independent of the heterogeneity. This is achieved by simultaneously constructing a steady-state multiscale ansatz space with certain approximation properties for the evolving solution and the initial data. The approximation properties of the multiscale ansatz space are derived using local-global splitting. A fully discrete scheme is analyzed using a first-order explicit exponential Euler scheme. We derive the error estimates in the $L^{2}$-norm and energy norm under the regularity assumptions for the semilinear term. The convergence rates depend on the coarse grid size and the level parameter. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Randomized Block Low-Rank Matrix Compression by Tagging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present randomized compression algorithms for flat rank-structured matrices with shared bases, termed uniform Block Low-Rank (BLR) matrices. Our main contribution is a technique called tagging, which improves upon the efficiency of existing algorithms for basis matrix computation while preserving accuracy. Tagging operates on the matrix using matrix-vector products of the matrix and its adjoint, making it suitable for black-box environments where accessing individual matrix entries is computationally expensive or infeasible. We show tagging requires a constant number of matrix-vector products coupled with linear post-processing; crucially, the asymptotic pre-factors in tagging depend only on the rank parameter and the underlying problem geometry. We also establish a theoretical connection between the optimal construction of tagging matrices and projective varieties in algebraic geometry, suggesting a hybrid numeric-symbolic avenue of future work. To validate our approach, we apply tagging to compress uniform BLR matrices arising from the discretization of integral and partial differential equations. Empirical results show that tagging outperforms alternative compression techniques, significantly reducing both the number of required matrix-vector products and overall computational time. These findings highlight the practicality and scalability of tagging as an efficient method for flat rank-structured matrices in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Improving patch selection for monolithic multigrid solvers for high-order {T}aylor-{H}ood discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows has been an active topic of research in Scientific Computing for many years, with many contributions to both discretizations and linear and nonlinear solvers. In this work, we propose an improved relaxation scheme for higher-order Taylor-Hood discretizations of the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrating its efficiency within monolithic multigrid preconditioners for the linear(ized) equations. The key to this improvement is an improved patch construction for Vanka-style relaxation introducing, for the first time, overlap in the pressure degrees of freedom within the patches. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvement in both multigrid iterations and time-to-solution for the linear Stokes case, on both triangular and quadrilateral meshes. For the nonlinear Navier-Stokes case, we show similar improvements, including in the number of nonlinear iterations needed in an inexact Newton method. These improvements enable three-dimensional numerical simulations, which also presented.</description>

      <title>High-order BUG dynamical low-rank integrators based on explicit Runge--Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce high-order Basis-Update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators extend the BUG integrator to arbitrary explicit Runge-Kutta schemes by performing a BUG step at each stage of the method. The resulting Runge-Kutta BUG (RK-BUG) integrators are robust with respect to small singular values, fully forward in time, and high-order accurate, while enabling conservation and rank adaptivity. We prove that RK-BUG integrators retain the order of convergence of the underlying Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation error, which vanishes as the rank becomes full. This theoretical analysis is supported by several numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the RK-BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other existing dynamical low-rank integrators.</description>

      <title>Constraints Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of relativistic astrophysics, the ideal equation of state with a constant adiabatic index provides a poor approximation due to its inconsistency with relativistic kinetic theory. However, it is a common practice to use it for relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Genuinely multi-dimensional stationarity preserving Finite Volume formulation for nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Finite Volume methods for multi-dimensional problems include stabilization (e.g.\ via a Riemann solver), that is derived by considering several one-dimensional problems in different directions. Such methods therefore ignore a possibly existing balance of contributions coming from different directions, such as the one characterizing multi-dimensional stationary states. Instead of being preserved, they are usually diffused away by such methods. Stationarity preserving methods use a better suited stabilization term that vanishes at the stationary state, allowing the method to preserve it. This work presents a general approach to stationarity preserving Finite Volume methods for nonlinear conservation/balance laws. It is based on a multi-dimensional stationarity preserving quadrature strategy that allows to naturally introduce genuinely multi-dimensional numerical fluxes. The new methods are shown to significantly outperform existing ones even if the latter are of higher order of accuracy and even on non-stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Convergence of Symmetric Triangle Quadrature Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric polynomial quadrature rules for triangles are commonly used to efficiently integrate two-dimensional domains in finite-element-type problems. While the development of such rules focuses on the maximum degree a given number of points can exactly integrate, smooth integrands are generally not polynomials of finite degree. Therefore, for such integrands, one needs to balance integration accuracy and computational cost. A natural approach to this balance is to choose the number of points such that the convergence rate with respect to the mesh size $h$ matches that of the other properties of the scheme, such as the planar or curved triangles that approximate the geometry or the basis functions that approximate the solution.
  In general, it is expected that a quadrature rule capable of integrating polynomials up to degree $d$ yields an integration error that is $\mathcal{O}(h^p)$, where $p=d+1$. However, as we describe in this paper, for symmetric triangle quadrature rules, when $d$ is even, $p=d+2$; therefore, for a $p^\text{th}$-order-accurate quadrature rule, fewer quadrature points are necessary, reducing the time required for matrix assembly in finite-element-type problems. This reduction in cost is modest for local differential operators that yield sparse matrices but appreciable for global integral operators that yield dense matrices.
  In this paper, we briefly summarize the details of symmetric triangle quadrature rules, discuss error implications for quadrature rules for one dimension and triangles, and we provide numerical examples that support our observation that polynomials that exactly integrate even maximum degrees converge faster than the conventional expectation for sequences of regular meshes.</description>

Abstract: This work extends the discrete compactness results of Walkington (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 47(6):4680--4710, 2010) for high-order discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations of parabolic problems to more general function space settings. In particular, we show a discrete version of the Aubin--Lions--Simon lemma that holds for general Banach spaces $X$, $B$, and $Y$ satisfying $X \hookrightarrow B$ compactly and $B \hookrightarrow Y$ continuously. Our proofs rely on the properties of a time reconstruction operator and remove the need for quasi-uniform time partitions assumed in previous works. Thus, we provide a useful and flexible tool for the analysis of high-order discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations of complex nonlinear partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Spectral equivalence of unsymmetric kernel matrices and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric kernel matrices are a well-researched topic in the literature of kernel based approximation. In particular stability properties in terms of lower bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of such symmetric kernel matrices are thoroughly investigated, as they play a fundamental role in theory and practice. In this work, we focus on unsymmetric kernel matrices and derive stability properties under small shifts by establishing a spectral equivalence to their unshifted, symmetric versions. This extends and generalizes results for translational invariant kernels upon Quak et al [SIAM Journal on Math. Analysis, 1993] and Sivakumar and Ward [Numerische Mathematik, 1993], however focussing instead on finitely smooth kernels. As applications, we consider convolutional kernels over domains, which are no longer translational invariant, but which are still an important class of kernels for applications. For these, we derive novel lower bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of the kernel matrices in terms of the separation distance of the data points, and thus derive stability bounds in terms of the condition number.</description>

      <title>On preconditioned Riemannian gradient methods for minimizing the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional: algorithms, global convergence and optimal local convergence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a unified framework for preconditioned Riemannian gradient (P-RG) methods to minimize Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) energy functionals with rotation on a Riemannian manifold. This framework enables comprehensive analysis of existing projected Sobolev gradient methods and facilitates the construction of highly efficient P-RG algorithms. Under mild assumptions on the preconditioner, we prove energy dissipation and global convergence. Local convergence is more challenging due to phase and rotational invariances. Assuming the GP functional is Morse-Bott, we derive a sharp Polyak-\L ojasiewicz (PL) inequality near minimizers. This allows precise characterization of the local convergence rate via the condition number $\mu/L$, where $\mu$ and $L$ are the lower and upper bounds of the spectrum of a combined operator (preconditioner and Hessian) on a closed subspace. By combining spectral analysis with the PL inequality, we identify an optimal preconditioner achieving the best possible local convergence rate: $(L-\mu)/(L+\mu)+\varepsilon$ ($\varepsilon&gt;0$ small). To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous derivation of the local convergence rate for P-RG methods applied to GP functionals with two symmetry structures. Numerical experiments on rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates validate the theoretical results and compare the performance of different preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Vertex-based Graph Neural Solver and its Application to Linear Elasticity Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient numerical solution of variable-coefficient linear elasticity equations on unstructured meshes presents a formidable challenge in computational mechanics. Convergence rates of classical iterative methods often stagnate due to material heterogeneity, strong anisotropy, and mesh irregularity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based hybrid iterative method that integrates a weighted block Jacobi smoother with a graph neural network-enhanced global corrector. We introduce the adaptive graph Fourier neural solver, which employs a learnable coordinate transformation to construct a dynamic, problem-dependent spectral basis. This approach effectively overcomes the limitations of fixed Fourier bases in capturing the multi-scale features inherent in variable-coefficient media. Furthermore, to handle 3D and strongly anisotropic systems, we develop the multilevel adaptive graph Fourier neural solver, which executes hierarchical error correction across cascading frequency bandwidths. Rigorous theoretical analysis, grounded in the energy norm and Korn's inequality, establishes mesh-independent convergence guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments on 2D and 3D elasticity problems demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior robustness and convergence rates compared to the classical smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid method, serving effectively as both a standalone solver and a preconditioner for Krylov subspace methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Boys function evaluation using minimax approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for efficient evaluation of Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{k_\mathrm{max}}$ tailored to modern computing architectures, in particular graphical processing units (GPUs), where maximum throughput is high and data movement is costly. The method combines rational minimax approximations with upward and downward recurrence relations. The non-negative real axis is partitioned into three regions, $[0,\infty\rangle = A\cup B\cup C$, where regions $A$ and $B$ are treated using rational minimax approximations and region $C$ by an asymptotic approximation. This formulation avoids lookup tables and irregular memory access, making it well suited hardware with high maximum throughput and low latency. The rational minimax coefficients are generated using the rational Remez algorithm. For a target maximum absolute error of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{tol} = 5\cdot10^{-14}$, the corresponding approximation regions and coefficients for Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{32}$ are provided in the appendix.</description>

Abstract: Numerical methods for developing port-Hamiltonian representations of general linear time-invariant systems are studied. The approach extends previous port-Hamiltonian characterizations to include the general non-minimal case and the case where the feedthrough term fails to have an invertible symmetric part. The resulting construction is able to identify infeasibility when the system fails to be port-Hamiltonian, and allows for the incorporation of perturbations in order to arrive at a nearby port-Hamiltonian system. Results are illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional fractional reaction-diffusion equations have numerous applications in the fields of biology, chemistry, and physics, and exhibit a range of rich phenomena. While classical algorithms have an exponential complexity in the spatial dimension, a quantum computer can produce a quantum state that encodes the solution with only polynomial complexity, provided that suitable input access is available. In this work, we investigate efficient quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear fractional reaction-diffusion equations with periodic boundary conditions. For linear equations, we analyze and compare the complexity of various methods, including the second-order Trotter formula, time-marching method, and truncated Dyson series method. We also present a novel algorithm that combines the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation technique with the interaction picture formalism, resulting in optimal scaling in the spatial dimension. For nonlinear equations, we employ the Carleman linearization method and propose a block-encoding version that is appropriate for the dense matrices that arise from the spatial discretization of fractional reaction-diffusion equations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a family of identities that express general linear non-unitary evolution operators as a linear combination of unitary evolution operators, each solving a Hamiltonian simulation problem. This formulation can exponentially enhance the accuracy of the recently introduced linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method [An, Liu, and Lin, Physical Review Letters, 2023]. For the first time, this approach enables quantum algorithms to solve linear differential equations with both optimal state preparation cost and near-optimal scaling in matrix queries on all parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum algorithms have garnered significant attention as a candidate approach for near-term quantum advantage using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this article we introduce kernel descent, a novel algorithm for minimizing the functions underlying variational quantum algorithms. We compare kernel descent to existing methods and carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we showcase scenarios in which kernel descent outperforms gradient descent and quantum analytic descent. The algorithm follows the well-established scheme of iteratively computing classical local approximations to the objective function and subsequently executing several classical optimization steps with respect to the former. Kernel descent sets itself apart with its employment of reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques in the construction of the local approximations, which leads to the observed advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multilevel sampling algorithm for fiber sampling problems in algebraic statistics, inspired by Henry Wynn's suggestion to adapt multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) ideas to discrete models. Focusing on log-linear models, we sample from high-dimensional lattice fibers defined by algebraic constraints. Building on Markov basis methods and results from Diaconis and Sturmfels, our algorithm uses variable step sizes to accelerate exploration and reduce the need for long burn-in. We introduce a novel Fiber Coverage Score (FCS) based on Voronoi partitioning to assess sample quality, and highlight the utility of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) quality metric. Simulations on benchmark fibers show that multilevel sampling outperforms naive MCMC approaches. Our results demonstrate that multilevel methods, when properly applied, provide practical benefits for discrete sampling in algebraic statistics.</description>

Abstract: Recovering a low rank matrix from a subset of its entries, some of which may be corrupted, is known as the robust matrix completion (RMC) problem. Existing RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method, denoted $\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions, $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several simulations the advantages of $\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries, overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pointwise Statistics in Hyperbolic Equations with Random Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional hyperbolic PDEs, linear and nonlinear, with random initial data. Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem, as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.</description>

      <title>Solvability Complexity Index Classification For Koopman Operator Spectra In $L^p$ For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of the approximate point spectrum and the approximate point $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of bounded Koopman operators acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d_{\mathcal{X}})$ with finite Borel measure $\omega$. Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index. Also we analyze the sufficiency and existence of a Wold-von Neumann decomposition analog, that was used in the special $L^2$-case.
  The main difficulty in extending from the already analyzed Hilbert setting $(p=2)$ to general $L^p$ is the loss of orthogonality and Hilbertian structure: there is no orthonormal basis with orthogonal coordinate projections in general, the canonical truncations $E_n$ in a computable Schauder dictionary need not be contractive (and may oscillate) and the Wold-von Neumann reduction has no directly computable analog in $L^p$. We overcome these obstacles by working with computable unconditional dictionaries adapted to dyadic/Lipschitz filtrations and proving stability of residual tests under non-orthogonal truncations.</description>

      <title>A Unified Low-rank ADI Framework with Shared Linear Solves for Simultaneously Solving Multiple Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods are computationally efficient and numerically effective tools for computing low-rank solutions of large-scale linear matrix equations. It is known in the literature that the low-rank ADI method for Lyapunov equations is a Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithm that implicitly performs model order reduction. It recursively enforces interpolation at the mirror images of the ADI shifts and places the poles of the reduced-order models at the ADI shifts. In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. These methods likewise enforce interpolation at the mirror images of the ADI shifts; however, they do not place the poles at the mirror images of the interpolation points. Instead, their pole placement ensures that the projected Sylvester and Riccati equations they implicitly solve admit a unique solution.
  By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADI framework.</description>
