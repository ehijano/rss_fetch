      <title>Formation and fragmentation of nylon fibre aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aggregation process of fibers suspended in a fluid remains an open question, despite its critical role in numerous natural and industrial processes. This paper presents an experimental setup designed to create fiber aggregates in a turbulent flow. The phase diagram for the aggregation states is established as a function of the experimental parameters, and the statistical properties of the resulting aggregates are characterized. Additionally, the fragmentation process is investigated, and a model is proposed to describe the fragmentation time of the aggregates, which is subsequently validated through comparison with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamical scaling in the inviscid limit of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with thermal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrally truncated three-dimensional (3D) Euler flows reach an absolute equilibrium. Yet they show non-trivial temporal correlations, similar to the ones of turbulent flows. In this work, we investigate Navier-Stokes equation in equilibrium conditions, both at finite viscosity and in the inviscid limit. We determine the space-time velocity correlations, using functional renormalisation group and direct numerical simulations. We characterise the crossover in the dynamical scaling from $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$ at finite viscosity to $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ in the inviscid limit, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We show that, although the static properties of spectrally truncated Euler flows radically differ from their hydrodynamical limit, they share a similar emergent $k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling.</description>

      <title>Boundary-layer modeling of polymer-based acoustofluidic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fluid-filled microchannels embedded in solid devices and driven by MHz ultrasound transducers, the thickness of the viscous boundary layer in the fluid near the confining walls is typically 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the acoustic wavelength and 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the longest dimension of the device. This large span in length scale renders direct numerical simulations of such devices prohibitively expensive in terms of computer memory requirements, and consequently, the so-called boundary-layer models are introduced. In such models, approximate analytical expressions of the boundary-layer fields are found and inserted in the governing equations and boundary conditions for the remaining bulk fields. Since the bulk fields do not vary across the boundary layers, they can be computed numerically using the resulting boundary-layer model without resolving the boundary layers. However, current boundary-layer models are only accurate for hard solids (e.g. glass and silicon) with relatively small oscillation amplitudes of the confining wall, and they fail for soft solids (e.g. polymers) with larger wall oscillations. In this work, we extend the boundary-layer model of Bach and Bruus, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 144, 766 (2018) to enable accurate simulation of soft-walled devices. The extended model is validated by comparing (1) with direct numerical simulations in three and two dimensions of tiny sub-mm and larger mm-sized polymer devices, respectively, and (2) with previously published experimental data.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Turbulence via an Instanton Gas Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.</description>

      <title>Sliding of a liquid spherical drop in an external fluid: a generalization of the Hadamard-Rybczynski equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical solution is obtained for the problem of the slow movement of a small drop of liquid in another immiscible liquid in an infinitely large reservoir with the boundary condition of partial slip at the liquid-liquid interface. That generalizes the conventional Navier condition of partial slip that given at the liquid-solid interface, since the solid (rigid) state can be considered as a liquid with infinite viscosity. A generalized Hadamard-Rybczynski equation (HRE) is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the conventional HRE. For infinite viscosity of the droplet, generalized HRE becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the all components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids, including diagonal tensor components. Generalized HRE is applied to the interpretation of the experiment in which the velocity of falling of a spherical droplet of silicate oil in the castor oil is investigated. Streamlines have been built corresponding to both the Hadamard-Rybczynski model and the partial slip approach. Presumably, the best applicability of the generalized HRE should be expected for the interface of hydrophobic liquid and hydrophilic one (water - hydrocarbons, water - higher alcohols, in general: aqueous emulsions, water - lipophilic organic liquids and oils, etc.). These are quite important emulsions in practical terms, for example, for the oil industry and medicine. Experimental methods for determining the slip length are discussed.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves in a continuum model for schooling swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex formations exhibited by schooling fish have long been the object of fascination for biologists and physicists. However, the physical and sensory mechanisms leading to organized collective behavior remain elusive. On the physical side in particular, it is unknown how the flows generated by individual fish influence the collective patterns that emerge in large schools. To address this question, we here present a continuum theory for a school of swimmers in an inline formation. The swimmers are modeled as flapping wings that interact through temporally nonlocal hydrodynamic forces, as arise when one swimmer moves through the lingering vortex wakes shed by others, leading to a system of time-delay-differential equations. Through coarse-graining, we derive a system of partial differential equations for the evolution of swimmer density and collective vorticity-induced hydrodynamic force. Linear stability analysis of the governing equations shows that there is a range of swimmer densities for which the uniform (constant-density) state is unstable to perturbations. Numerical simulations reveal families of stable traveling wave solutions, where a uniform school destabilizes into a collection of densely populated "sub-schools" separated by relatively sparse regions that move as a propagating wave. We find that distinct propagating waves may be stable for the same set of kinematic parameters. Generally, our results show that temporally nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions can lead to rich collective behavior in schools of swimmers.</description>

      <title>Thermal fingers in cold channels: Thermo-viscous instability in dispersive flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An instability may occur when a hot viscous fluid, such as magma, flows into a thin gap and cools due to heat transfer to the surrounding environment, such as the host rock. Fluids that exhibit a drastic increase in viscosity as they cool give rise to a feedback loop where hotter regions flow faster, cooling more slowly, thus forming ``fingers'' of hot fluid. To investigate this phenomenon, we employ a model system in which hot fluid is injected into a Hele-Shaw cell where the top and bottom plates exchange heat between the fluid and a cold environment. We include both thermal diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion in a two-dimensional description, allowing us to address the dependence of the instability on the P\'eclet number (ratio of advective to diffusive fluxes). We perform numerical simulations of temperature-dependent viscous fluid flow and find that finger-like instabilities emerge in response to small perturbations in the inlet velocity, depending on three control parameters: the P\'eclet number, the viscosity contrast, and the cooling rate through the confining plates. Using linear stability analysis, we compute the dispersion relation and determine how the fastest growth rate $\gamma_{\max}$ and the corresponding wavenumber $k_{\max}$ depend on these parameters. We also derive analytical expressions for $\gamma_{\max}$ and $ k_{\max}$ valid in the regime of high P\'eclet number and high viscosity contrast. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms driving such instabilities, which could influence the formation and propagation of preferred pathways during fissure eruptions in geophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Drag modelling for flows through assemblies of spherical particles with machine learning: A comparison of approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drag forces on particles in random assemblies can be accurately estimated through particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS). Despite its limited applicability to relatively small assemblies, data obtained from PR-DNS has been the driving force for the development of drag closures for much more affordable simulation frameworks, such as Eulerian-Lagrangian point particle methods. Recently, more effort has been invested in the development of deterministic drag models that account for the effect of the structure of the particle assembly. Current successful deterministic models are mainly black-box neural networks which: 1) Assume pairwise superposition of the neighbours' effect on the drag, and 2) Are trained on PR-DNS data for a wide range of particle concentrations and flow regimes. To alleviate the black-box nature of neural networks, we use genetic programming (GP) to develop interpretable models. In our previous research, this has been proven successful in the Stokes regime. In the current contribution, we extend the application of GP to higher particle Reynolds number regimes. This is done by training a graph neural network (GNN) on the PR-DNS data to learn the pairwise interactions among the particles that constitute the drag variation. The significance of the input features of the GNN is assessed via a feature permutation approach. Then, the estimated pairwise interactions as extracted from the GNN are fed to a GP algorithm, which searches for symbolic expressions that fit the input data. A comparison between the trained GNN model and the resulting symbolic expressions is presented, to assess whether the symbolic expression can capture the underlying patterns learnt by the GNN. The comparison demonstrates the potential of GP in finding relatively simple symbolic models. At the same time, the accuracy of the symbolic models slightly fall behind the GNN.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Motion and hydrodynamic resistance of an elastic bead confined in a square microchannel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.</description>

      <title>Solute mixing in porous media with dispersion and buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the process of convective mixing in two-dimensional, homogeneous and isotropic porous media with dispersion. We considered a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in which the presence of a solute produces density differences driving the flow. The effect of dispersion is modelled using an anisotropic Fickian dispersion tensor (Bear, J. Geophys. Res. 1961). In addition to molecular diffusion ($D_m^*$), the solute is redistributed by an additional spreading, in longitudinal and transverse flow directions, which is quantified by the coefficients $D_l^*$ and $D_t^*$, respectively, and it is produced by the presence of the pores. The flow is controlled by three dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh-Darcy number $Ra$, defining the relative strength of convection and diffusion, and the dispersion parameters $r=D_l^*/D_t^*$ and $\Delta=D_m^*/D_t^*$. With the aid of numerical Darcy simulations, we investigate the mixing dynamics without and with dispersion. We find that in absence of dispersion ($\Delta\to\infty$) the dynamics is self-similar and independent of $Ra$, and the flow evolves following several regimes, which we analyse. Then we analyse the effect of dispersion on the flow evolution for a fixed value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number ($Ra=10^4$). A detailed analysis of the molecular and dispersive components of the mean scalar dissipation reveals a complex interplay between flow structures and solute mixing. The proposed theoretical framework, in combination with pore-scale simulations and bead packs experiments, can be used to validate and improve current dispersion models to obtain more reliable estimates of solute transport and spreading in buoyancy-driven subsurface flows.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic machine learning for time-varying mode decomposition of separated aerodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an information-theoretic mode decomposition for separated aerodynamic flows. The current data-driven approach based on a neural network referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal structure. We consider four examples of separated flows around a wing, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, strong gust-wing interactions of 2. numerical and 3. experimental measurements, and 4. a turbulent wake in a spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the fluctuation level from their mean values. With the examples of gust-wing interactions, how the effect of gust on a wing emerges in the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of unsteady aerodynamic problems.</description>

Abstract: A floating Leidenfrost droplet exhibits curvature inversion of its underside, due to the balance of vapor pressure and surface tension. Using interferometric imaging, we find different behavior for a levitated hydrogel sphere. Curvature inversion is observed briefly just after deposition, but quickly gives way to a steady state with no inversion. We show the essential role of vaporization on shaping the underbelly of the hydrogel, adding a new component to the interplay between vapor pressure and elastic force</description>

      <title>Scale locality of information flow in shell models of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</description>
