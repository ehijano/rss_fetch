      <title>Extensions of realizable Hamiltonian and complexity one GKM$_4$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the GKM graphs of GKM$_4$ manifolds that are either Hamiltonian or of complexity one extend to torus graphs. The arguments are based on a reformulation of the extension problem in terms of a natural representation of the fundamental group of the GKM graph, using a coordinate-free version of the axial function group of Kuroki, as well as on covers of GKM graphs and acyclicity results for orbit spaces of GKM manifolds.</description>

      <title>Spectral moduli problems for level structures and an integral Jacquet-Langlands dual of Morava E-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an E-infinity ring spectrum R, with motivation from chromatic homotopy theory, we define relative effective Cartier divisors for a spectral Deligne-Mumford stack over Spet(R) and prove that, as a functor from connective R-algebras to topological spaces, it is representable. This enables us to solve various moduli problems of level structures on spectral abelian varieties, overcoming difficulty at primes dividing the level. In particular, we obtain higher-homotopical refinement for finite levels of a Lubin-Tate tower as E-infinity ring spectra, which generalizes Morava, Hopkins, Miller, Goerss, and Lurie's spectral realization of the deformation ring at the ground level. Moreover, passing to the infinite level and then descending along the equivariantly isomorphic Drinfeld tower, we obtain a Jacquet-Langlands dual to the Morava E-theory spectrum, along with homotopy fixed point spectral sequences dual to those studied by Devinatz and Hopkins. These serve as potential tools for computing higher-periodic homotopy types from pro-etale cohomology of p-adic general linear groups.</description>

      <title>A Colorful Version of Carath\'eodory's Theorem plus a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a topological framework in an attempt to generalize the classical colourful Caratheodory theorem by imposing an additional constraint. For that we introduce the notion of zero-avoding complexes and covering criteria for the existence of colourful transversals. Using the developed method in combination with the homological Nerve theorem of Meshulam we recover all known versions of the colourful Caratheodory's theorem and prove a constraint extension which, in particular, implies an extension of the original (affine) Tverberg result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of open subsets in a proximity space (X,{\zeta}) forms a topological system that enables the definition of proximal and descriptive topological groups. This framework naturally extends to proximal and descriptive topological rings as well. In this study, I review fundamental properties and related results, with particular emphasis on the definition of proximal and descriptive fields. In addition, I examine the behavior of closed sets in proximal and descriptive topological rings.</description>

      <title>Homological vanishing for the Steinberg representation II: reductive groups and integral conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the homology groups of any connected reductive group over a field with coefficients in the Steinberg representation vanish in a range. The generalizes work of Ash-Putman-Sam on the classical split groups. We state a connectivity conjecture that would allow us to prove such a vanishing result for $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$, as was conjectured by Church-Farb-Putman. We prove some special cases of this conjecture and use it to refine known results about the first and second of homology of $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ with Steinberg coefficients.</description>

      <title>A bilinear form for spin$^c$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $(8n {+} 2)$-dimensional closed oriented spin$^{c}$ manifold, denote by $[M]$ the fundamental class of $M$, $\langle \cdot ~, ~\cdot \rangle$ the Kronecker product, and $\rho_{2} \colon H^{4n}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow H^{4n}(M; \mathbb{Z}/2)$ the $\bmod ~ 2$ reduction homomorphism. In this paper, we will prove that the following identity \[ \langle \rho_2(t) \cdot Sq^2 \rho_2 (t), [M] \rangle = \langle \rho_2 (t) \cdot Sq^2 v_{4n}(M), [M]\rangle, \] holds for any torsion class $t \in H^{4n}(M;\mathbb{Z})$, where $Sq^2$ is the steenrod square, $v_{4n}(M)$ is the $4n$-th Wu class of $M$ and $x \cdot y$ means the cup product of $x$ and $y$. This is a generalization of the work of Landweber and Stong for spin manifolds.
  As an application, denote by $\beta^{\mathbb{Z}/2} \colon H^{4n+2}(M; \mathbb{Z}/2) \to H^{4n+3}(M; \mathbb{Z})$ the Bockstein homomorphism, we can get that $\beta^{\mathbb{Z}/2}(Sq^2 v_{4n}(M)) = 0$, and hence $Sq^3 v_{4n}(M) = 0$, for any closed oriented spin$^{c}$ manifold $M$ with $\dim M \le 8n{+}1$.</description>

      <title>Computing singular simplicial homologies of digraphs and quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of large complex systems are predominately modeled through pairwise interactions, the principle underlying structure being a network of the form of a digraph or quiver. Significant success has been obtained in applying the homology of the directed flag complex to study digraphs arising as networks within numerous scientific disciplines. This homology of directed cliques enjoys relative ease of computation when compared to other digraph homologies, making it preferable for use in applications concerning large networks. By extending the ideas of singular simplicial homology to quivers in categories of different morphisum types, several new singular simplicial homology theories have recently been constructed.
  Computationally efficient homologies for quivers have in general not previously been seriously considered. In this paper we develop further the homotopy theory of quivers necessary to derive functors that realise isomorphisums between the singular simplicial quiver homologies and the homologies of certain spaces. The simplicial chains of these spaces arise in a conveniently compact form that is at least as convenient as the directed flag complex for computations.
  Moreover, our constructions are natural with respect to the isomorphisums on homology making them suitable for applications in conjunction with persistent homology for practical use. In particular, for each of the singular simplicial homologies considered, we provided efficient algorithms for the computation of their persistent homology.</description>

      <title>On integral extensions between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to study Ext-groups between certain functors defined on the category of finitely generated free groups. Rational Ext-groups between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers are known, and are almost always equal to zero. Recently, using homotopical methods, Arone constructed an explicit bounded complex whose homology corresponds to the integral Ext-groups between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers. The homology of this complex is far from being trivial. Using this complex, we explicitly calculate some of these Ext-groups. More precisely, we compute Ext^1, Ext^2, Ext^{d-1} and Ext^{d-2} between the abelianization functor and its dth symmetric power. We further explain how Arone's complex can be obtained from an explicit projective resolution of the abelianization functor. We compare our results with the computation of Ext-groups between functors from finitely generated free abelian groups, obtained by Franjou and Pirashvili. In particular, we obtain that the composition with the abelianization functor induces an isomorphism for the Ext^1 considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Open 2D TFTs admit initial open-closed extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any open 2-dimensional topological field theory valued in a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category (with suitable colimits) extends canonically to an open-closed field theory whose value at the circle is the Hochschild homology object of its value at the disk. As a corollary, we obtain an action of the moduli spaces of surfaces on the Hochschild homology object of $E_1$-Calabi-Yau algebras. This provides a space level refinement of previous work of Costello over $\mathbb{Q}$ and Wahl-Westerland and Wahl over $\mathbb{Z}$, and serves as a crucial ingredient to Lurie's "non-compact cobordism hypothesis" in dimension 2. As part of the proof we also give a description of slice categories of the d-dimensional bordism category with boundary, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this summary paper, we present the key ideas behind the recent proof of the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups, which states that complements of locally finite affine hyperplane arrangements with real equations and stable under orthogonal reflections are aspherical. We survey three facets of the argument: the combinatorics of noncrossing partition posets associated with Coxeter groups; the appearance of dual Artin groups and the question of their isomorphism with standard Artin groups; the topological models and their interplay in the proof.</description>

      <title>Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism for derived Deligne-Mumford stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Hochschild-Konstant-Rosenberg theorem for general derived Deligne-Mumford (DM) stacks, extending the results of Arinkin-C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru-Hablicsek in the smooth, global quotient case although with different methods. To formulate our result, we introduce the notion of orbifold inertia stack of a derived DM stack; this supplies a finely tuned derived enhancement of the classical inertia stack, which does not coincide with the classical truncation of the free loop space. We show that, in characteristic 0, the shifted tangent bundle of the orbifold inertia stack is equivalent to the free loop space. This yields an explicit HKR equivalence between Hochschild homology and differential forms on the orbifold inertia stack, as algebras. We also construct a stacky filtered circle, leading to a filtration on the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack whose associated graded complex recovers the de Rham theory of its orbifold inertia stack. This provides a generalization of recent work of Moulinos-Robalo-To\"en to the setting of derived DM stacks.</description>

Abstract: In this article we introduce invariants of points of the Balmer spectrum of the Voevodsky motivic category whose values are "light Rost cycle submodules" of the module of pure symbols in Milnor's K-theory (mod 2). As an application, we show that isotropic points of the Balmer spectrum are closed. We also introduce the notion of points of a boundary type and show that this class contains isotropic points, but not the etale one.</description>

      <title>Morse sequences on stacks and flooding sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper builds upon the framework of \emph{Morse sequences}, a simple and effective approach to discrete Morse theory. A Morse sequence on a simplicial complex consists of a sequence of nested subcomplexes generated by expansions and fillings-two operations originally introduced by Whitehead. Expansions preserve homotopy, while fillings introduce critical simplexes that capture essential topological features. We extend the notion of Morse sequences to \emph{stacks}, which are monotonic functions defined on simplicial complexes, and define \emph{Morse sequences on stacks} as those whose expansions preserve the homotopy of all sublevel sets. This extension leads to a generalization of the fundamental collapse theorem to weighted simplicial complexes. Within this framework, we focus on a refined class of sequences called \emph{flooding sequences}, which exhibit an ordering behavior similar to that of classical watershed algorithms. Although not every Morse sequence on a stack is a flooding sequence, we show that the gradient vector field associated with any Morse sequence can be recovered through a flooding sequence. Finally, we present algorithmic schemes for computing flooding sequences using cosimplicial complexes.</description>

Abstract: We study the decategorification process that takes an Azumaya algebra to its $K(1)$-local $K$-theory. We prove various injectivity statements and relate precisely certain Brauer groups (more precisely, spectra) to certain $K$-theoretic strict Picard spectra or strict unit spectra. For example, we prove that for fields $F$ of characteristic $\neq p$, $\mathbf{Br}(F)[p^{\infty}] \simeq \mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}(L_{K(1)}K(F)\otimes \mathbb{S}_{W(\overline{\mathbb F_p})})[p^\infty]$ where $\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}$ is Carmeli's strict Picard spectrum, and $\mathbf{Br}(F)$ denotes the Brauer space of the field $F$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit gluing properties of cluster tilting subcategories in exact $\infty$-categories within the framework of perverse schobers on surfaces with boundary. These results are based on a study of the restriction functors from global sections of perverse schobers to local sections and their adjoint induction functors.

      <title>Quillen homology of spectral Lie algebras with application to mod $p$ homology of labeled configuration spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general method computing the mod $p$ Quillen homology of algebras over a monad that parametrizes the structure of mod $p$ homology of spectral Lie algebras. This is the $E^2$-page of the bar spectral sequence converging to the mod $p$ topological Quillen homology of spectral Lie algebras. The computation of the Quillen homology of the trivial algebra allows us to deduce that the $\mathbb F_p$-linear spectral Lie operad is not formal. As an application, we study the mod $p$ homology of the labeled configuration space $B_k(M;X)$ of $k$ points in a manifold $M$ with labels in a spectrum $X$, which is the mod $p$ topological Quillen homology of a certain spectral Lie algebra by a result of Knudsen. We obtain general upper bounds for the mod $p$ homology of $B_k(M;X)$, as well as explicit computations for small $k$. When $p$ is odd, we observe that the mod $p$ homology of $B_k(M^n;S^r)$ for small $k$ depends on and only on the cohomology ring of the one-point compactification of $M$ when $n+r$ is even. This supplements and contrasts with the result of B\"{o}digheimer-Cohen-Taylor when $n+r$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Euler Characteristics and Homotopy Types of Definable Sublevel Sets, with Applications to Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a definable function $f: S \to \mathbb{R}$ on a definable set $S$, we study sublevel sets of the form $S^f_t = \{x \in S: f(x) \leq t\}$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Using o-minimal structures, we prove that the Euler characteristic of $S^f_t$ is right continuous with respect to $t$. Furthermore, when $S$ is compact, we show that $S^f_{t+\delta}$ deformation retracts to $S^f_t$ for all sufficiently small $\delta &gt; 0$. Applying these results, we also characterize the connections between the following concepts in topological data analysis: the Euler characteristic transform (ECT), smooth ECT, Euler-Radon transform (ERT), and smooth ERT.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence in $\mathbb{F}_p$-synthetic spectra, computing the synthetic analogs of $\mathrm{BP}$ and its cooperations to identify the synthetic Adams-Novikov $\mathrm{E}_2$-page, computed in a range with a synthetic algebraic Novikov spectral sequence. We then identify deformations associated to the Cartan-Eilenberg and algebraic Novikov spectral sequences in terms of stable comodule categories, categorifying an algebraic Novikov spectral sequence result of Gheorghe-Wang-Xu. We then apply Isaksen-Wang-Xu methods in $\mathbb{F}_2$-synthetic spectra to deduce differentials in the $p=2$ synthetic Adams-Novikov for the sphere, producing almost entirely algebraic computations through the 45-stem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the higher (sequential) topological complexity, a numerical homotopy invariant for the planar polygon spaces. For these spaces with a small genetic codes and dimension $m$, Davis showed that their topological complexity is either $2m$ or $2m+1$. We extend these bounds to the setting of higher topological complexity. In particular, when $m$ is power of $2$, we show that the $k$-th higher topological complexity of these spaces is either $km$ or $km+1.$</description>

      <title>Inertia groups of $(n-1)$-connected $2n$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the inertia groups of $(n-1)$-connected, smooth, closed, oriented $2n$-manifolds where $n \geq 3$. As a consequence, we complete the diffeomorphism classification of such manifolds, finishing a program initiated by Wall sixty years ago, with the exception of the $126$-dimensional case of the Kervaire invariant one problem.
  In particular, we find that the inertia group always vanishes for $n \neq 4,8,9$ -- for $n \gg 0$, this was known by the work of several previous authors, including Wall, Stolz, and Burklund and Hahn with the first named author. When $n = 4,8,9$, we apply Kreck's modified surgery and a special case of Crowley's $Q$-form conjecture, proven by Nagy, to compute the inertia groups of these manifolds. In the cases $n=4,8$, our results recover unpublished work of Crowley--Nagy and Crowley--Olbermann.
  In contrast, we show that the homotopy and concordance inertia groups of $(n-1)$-connected, smooth, closed, oriented $2n$-manifolds with $n \geq 3$ always vanish.</description>

Abstract: We prove a comparison result between two duality statements - Takai duality, which is implemented by the crossed product functor $- \rtimes G: KK^{G} \to KK^{\hat G}$ on equivariant Kasparov categories; and Treumann duality, which asserts the existence of an exotic equivalence of stable $\infty$-categories $\text{Mod}(KU_p[G])^{ft} \simeq \text{Mod}(KU_p[\hat G])^{ft}$ given by tensoring with a particular $(G,\hat G)$-bimodule $\textbf{M}$.</description>

      <title>Reflection Equivariance and the Heisenberg Picture for Spaces of Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monoidal product, braiding, balancing and weak duality are pieces of algebraic information that are well-known to have their origin in oriented genus zero surfaces and their mapping classes. More precisely, each of them correspond to operations of the cyclic framed $E_2$-operad. We extend this correspondence to include another algebraic piece of data, namely the modified trace, by showing that it amounts to a homotopy fixed point structure with respect to the homotopy involution that reverses the orientation of surfaces and dualizes the state spaces. We call such a homotopy fixed point structure reflection equivariance. As an application, we describe the effect of orientation reversal on spaces of conformal blocks and skein modules in the non-semisimple setting, throughout relying on their factorization homology description. This has important consequences: For a modular functor that is reflection equivariant relative to a rigid duality, i) the circle category is modular, and the resulting mapping class group representations are automatically the ones built by Lyubashenko, and ii) the modules over the internal skein algebras are generated by one simple representation, carrying a unique projective mapping class group representation making the action equivariant. While i) is a new topological characterization of not necessarily semisimple modular categories, ii) generalizes the implicit description of spaces of conformal blocks purely through the representation theory of moduli algebras given by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus from rational conformal field theories admitting a Hopf algebra description to finite rigid logarithmic conformal field theories. This also generalizes several results of Faitg from ribbon factorizable Hopf algebras to arbitrary modular categories.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Correlators in Finite Rigid Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article applies to the open-closed sector and generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients obtained by the evaluation of the torus partition function at projective objects are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins using physically-motivated potentials for non-polar interactions, can identify the biologically correct assembly as the energy-minimizing state. Short-range potentials, however, produce rugged energy landscapes, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy.
  This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>
