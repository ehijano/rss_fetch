      <title>A simple lower bound for the complexity of estimating partition functions on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of estimating the partition function ${\mathsf{Z}}(\beta)=\sum_{x\in\chi} e^{-\beta H(x)}$ for a Gibbs distribution characterized by the Hamiltonian $H(x)$. We provide a simple and natural lower bound for quantum algorithms that solve this task by relying on reflections through the coherent encoding of Gibbs states. Our primary contribution is a $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound for the number of reflections needed to estimate the partition function with a quantum algorithm. We also prove a $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ query lower bound for classical algorithms. The proofs are based on a reduction from the problem of estimating the Hamming weight of an unknown binary string.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Minimizing Energy Consumption of Partitioning DAG Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a graph partition problem where we are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose vertices and arcs can be respectively regarded as tasks and dependencies among tasks. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total energy consumed for completing these tasks by assigning the tasks to k heterogeneous machines. We first show that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we present polynomial-time algorithms for two special cases where there are only two machines and where the input DAG is a directed path. Finally, we study a natural variant where there are only two machines with one of them being capable of executing a limited number of tasks. We show that this special case remains computationally hard.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Cluster Vertex Splitting and Company</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering a graph when the clusters can overlap can be seen from three different angles: We may look for cliques that cover the edges of the graph with bounded overlap, we may look to add or delete few edges to uncover the cluster structure, or we may split vertices to separate the clusters from each other. Splitting a vertex $v$ means to remove it and to add two new copies of $v$ and to make each previous neighbor of $v$ adjacent with at least one of the copies. In this work, we study underlying computational problems regarding the three angles to overlapping clusterings, in particular when the overlap is small. We show that the above-mentioned covering problem is NP-complete. We then make structural observations that show that the covering viewpoint and the vertex-splitting viewpoint are equivalent, yielding NP-hardness for the vertex-splitting problem. On the positive side, we show that splitting at most $k$ vertices to obtain a cluster graph has a problem kernel with $O(k)$ vertices. Finally, we observe that combining our hardness results with the so-called critical-clique lemma yields NP-hardness for Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting, which was previously open (Abu-Khzam et al. [ISCO 2018]) and independently shown to be NP-hard by Arrighi et al. [IPEC 2023]. We observe that a previous version of the critical-clique lemma was flawed; a corrected version has appeared in the meantime on which our hardness result is based.</description>

      <title>Horoballs and the subgradient method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore convex optimization on Hadamard spaces, we consider an iteration in the style of a subgradient algorithm. Traditionally, such methods assume that the underlying spaces are manifolds and that the objectives are geodesically convex: the methods are described using tangent spaces and exponential maps. By contrast, our iteration applies in a general Hadamard space, is framed in the underlying space itself, and relies instead on horospherical convexity of the objective level sets. For this restricted class of objectives, we prove a complexity result of the usual form. Notably, the complexity does not depend on a lower bound on the space curvature. We illustrate our subgradient algorithm on the minimal enclosing ball problem in Hadamard spaces.</description>
