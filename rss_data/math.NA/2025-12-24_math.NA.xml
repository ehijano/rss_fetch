      <title>Asymptotic preserving methods for the low mach limit in discrete velocity models approximating kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Lattice Boltzmann type discrete velocity model in the low Mach number scaling and develop a corresponding numerical scheme that remains uniformly valid across all regimes of the mean free path, from the kinetic to the hydrodynamic scale. The proposed framework ensures high order temporal accuracy through the use of Implicit Explicit Runge Kutta methods, which provide stability and efficiency in stiff regimes, while spatial resolution is enhanced by combining finite difference WENO reconstructions with high order central difference approximations. In the appropriate asymptotic limit, the scheme reduces to a high order finite difference formulation of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations, thereby guaranteeing physical consistency of the numerical approximation with the limit model. To corroborate the theoretical findings, a set of numerical experiments is performed on two dimensional benchmark problems, which confirm the accuracy, stability, and versatility of the method across different flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Weight Window Method for Global Time-Dependent Monte Carlo Particle Transport Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm for time-dependent particle transport problems with global variance reduction based on automatic weight windows (WWs). The centers of WWs at a time step are defined by the solution of an auxiliary hybrid MC / deterministic problem formed by the low-order second-moment (LOSM) equations. The closures for the hybrid LOSM equations are calculated by the MC method. The LOSM equations are discretized by a scheme of the second-order accuracy in time and space. Filtering techniques are applied to reduce noise effects in the LOSM closures. The WWs defined with the auxiliary solution give rise to sufficiently uniform MC particle distribution in space on each time step. The algorithm is analyzed by means of an analytic transport benchmark. We study performance of the MC algorithm depending on a set parameters of WWs. Figure of merit and relative error results are presented, demonstrating the performance of the hybrid MC method and quantifying its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quasi-interpolation with random sampling centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a general quasi-interpolation framework for stochastic function approximation, which stems and draws motivation from convolution-type solutions for certain practical weighted variational problems.
  We obtain our quasi-interpolants using Monte Carlo discretization of the pertinent integrals and establish a family of $L^p$-McDiarmid-type concentration inequalities for $1\leq p\leq \infty$, which resulted in verifiable expected error estimates for the stochastic quasi-interpolants. The $L^1$-version of these concentration inequalities
  is dynamically-independent of dimensions, which offers a partial stochastic mitigation of the so called ``curse of dimensionality". The $L^\infty$-version of these concentration inequalities strengthens the existing expected $L^\infty$-error estimates in the literature. Numerical simulation results are provided at the end of the paper to validate the underlying theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Deep Eigenspace Network and Its Application to Parametric Non-selfadjoint Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider operator learning for efficiently solving parametric non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problems. To overcome the spectral instability and mode switching inherent in non-selfadjoint operators, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns the stable invariant eigensubspace mapping rather than individual eigenfunctions. We proposed a Deep Eigenspace Network (DEN) architecture integrating Fourier Neural Operators, geometry-adaptive POD bases, and explicit banded cross-mode mixing mechanisms to capture complex spectral dependencies on unstructured meshes. We apply DEN to the parametric non-selfadjoint Steklov eigenvalue problem and provide theoretical proofs for the Lipschitz continuity of the eigensubspace with respect to the parameters. In addition, we derive error bounds for the reconstruction of the eigenspace. Numerical experiments validate DEN's high accuracy and zero-shot generalization capabilities across different discretizations.</description>

      <title>An energy- and helicity-conserving enriched galerkin method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an enriched Galerkin (EG) method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that conserves both kinetic energy and helicity in the inviscid limit without introducing any additional projection variables. The method employs an EG velocity space, which is the first-order continuous Galerkin space enriched with piecewise constants defined on mesh faces, together with piecewise-constant pressure. Two numerical schemes based on the rotational form of the convective term are proposed: a nonlinear scheme and a linear variant. Both schemes exactly preserve the discrete helicity and kinetic energy, and the Picard iteration maintains the conservation properties of the nonlinear scheme. We prove the conservation properties of both the methods, and establish stability and rigorous error estimates for the nonlinear scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and conservation of the proposed linear scheme.</description>

      <title>A Certified Goal-Oriented A Posteriori Defeaturing Error Estimator for Elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defeaturing, the process of simplifying computational geometries, is a critical step in industrial simulation pipelines for reducing computational cost. Rigorous a posteriori estimators exist for the global energy-norm error introduced by geometry simplifications. However, practitioners are usually more concerned with the accuracy of specific quantities of interest (QoIs) in the solution. This paper bridges that gap by developing mathematically certified, goal-oriented a posteriori defeaturing error estimators for Poisson's equation, linear elasticity, and Stokes flow. First, we derive new reliable energy-norm estimators for features subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in linear elasticity and Stokes flow, based on existing results for Poisson's equation. Second, we formulate general energy-norm estimators for multiple negative features, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the first time. Finally, we combine these estimators with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method to obtain reliable estimates for linear QoIs and demonstrate their effectiveness across a range of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Manifold Function Encoder: Identifying Different Functions Defined on Different Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Manifold Function Encoder (MFE) for identifying different functions defined on different manifolds. Both a manifold in Euclidean space and a function defined on this manifold can be viewed as bounded linear functionals on a suitable space of continuous functions. From this perspective, we treat manifold functions as elements of the dual space. By expanding them in the dual space based on appropriate approximating sequence of bases, we obtain a corresponding method for encoding manifold functions, that is MFE. Especially, we prove that MFE achieves super-algebraic convergence based on smooth bases commonly used in spectral methods, such as Legendre polynomials and Fourier basis. We further extend MFE to handle more complex cases, including joint manifold functions of different dimensions and manifold functions with different measures. In addition, we show the approximation theory for MFE-based operator learning, in particular learning the solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains, together with several numerical experiments including the 2-d Poisson equation and the 3-d elasticity problem on the real-world bearing.</description>

      <title>A Pick function approach for designing energy-decay preserving schemes of the Maxwell equations in Havriliak-Negami dispersive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach for designing high-order energy-decaying schemes for Maxwell's equations in Havriliak-Negami dispersive media. It is shown that conventional convolution quadrature (CQ) methods, which rely directly on the generating function of linear multistep methods, cannot generate completely monotonic sequences beyond first-order accuracy. We rigorously prove that for any linear multistep method of second-or higher-order, the associated generating function $\delta(\zeta)$ cannot satisfy both that \(-\delta(\zeta)\) is a Pick function and that it is analytic on \((-\infty,1)\) - a key requirement for constructing completely monotonic sequences. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce a reconstruction of the generating function's structure. By strategically incorporating the theory of Pick functions, we successfully construct a second-order completely monotonic sequence. This theoretical advance leads to a discrete scheme that inherits the continuous model's energy decay property, guaranteeing unconditional stability. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rates and energy dissipation behavior of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A variational multiscale approach to PDE-constrained optimization problems arising in Data-Driven Computational Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the primal and dual forms of the optimality conditions for PDE-contrained optimization problems arising in Data-Driven Computational Mechanics when specialized to the reaction-diffusion context. Starting with the continuous setting, we establish well-posedness of such concomitant formulations. Then, we propose stable and consistent finite element approximations for these underlying primal and dual problems relying on the Variational MultiScale framework. For quasi-uniform finite element partitions, we investigate approximations' general properties and establish well-posedness for two canonical choices of the sub-grid scales, i.e., the Algebraic Sub-Grid Scale and Orthogonal Sub-Grid Scale. Moreover, for continuous finite element functions, we are able to move back and forth between the discrete primal and dual formulations only by changing the design of the stabilization parameters. To conclude, we stress-test the proposed approximations through a series of progressively sophisticated cases, providing both a comparative and qualitative assessment of their numerical performance.</description>

      <title>The Isogeometric Fast Fourier-based Diagonalization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of robust solvers for linear systems obtained from the discretization of partial differential equations using Isogeometric Analysis is challenging since the condition number of the system matrix not only grows with the reciprocal square of the grid size (for second order problems), but also exponentially with the spline degree. The Fast Diagonalization method allows the construction of a preconditioner that is robust both in grid size and spline degree. Although this method is efficient in practice, its computational complexity is superlinear in the number of degrees of freedom. In this work, we construct a variant of the Fast Diagonalization method that can exploit the Fast Fourier Transformation. Note that, because of boundary effects, a Fourier Transformation cannot diagonalize the overall problem. We circumvent this issue using a stable splitting of the spline space. The resulting preconditioner is still robust with respect to the grid size and spline degree and can be realized with a computational complexity that grows almost linearly with the number of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Implicit-explicit schemes for compressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations on staggered grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a second-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-stepping scheme for the isentropic, compressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations discretized on staggered (MAC) grids. The scheme is based on finite difference approximations that ensure a stable coupling among the velocity, density and phase field, with symmetric operators acting on the discretized viscosity terms.
  Standard explicit methods suffer from severe time-step restrictions due to the presence of second to fourth-order diffusion terms introduced by the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes operators. To overcome these challenges, we develop an IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme that treats the stiff terms implicitly while the convective terms are dealt with explicitly, with the advantage that only linear systems are solved at each stage.
  Numerical experiments are performed to verify the stability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Approximation bounds for norm constrained deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the approximation capacity of neural networks with an arbitrary activation function and with norm constraint on the weights. Upper and lower bounds on the approximation error of these networks are computed for smooth function classes. The upper bound is proven by first approximating high-degree monomials and then generalizing it to functions via a partition of unity and Taylor expansion. The lower bound is derived through the Rademacher complexity of neural networks. A probabilistic version of the upper bound is also provided by considering neural networks with randomly sampled weights and biases. Finally, it is shown that the assumption on the regularity of the activation function can be significantly weakened without worsening the approximation error, and the approximation upper bound is validated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Variational Characterization and A Line Search Newton-Noda Method for the unifying spectral problem of nonnegative tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the general $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-eigenvalue problem of nonnegative tensors introduced by A. Gautier, F. Tudisco, and M. Hein [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 40 (2019), pp. 1206--1231], which unifies several well-studied tensor eigenvalue and singular value problems. First, we propose an alternative min-max Collatz--Wielandt formula for the $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-spectral radius, which bypasses the auxiliary multihomogeneous mapping employed in that work. This variational characterization both recovers several classical results and admits a natural convex reformulation. It arises from an alternative approach that directly connects the $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem to a class of convex programs.
  We then develop and analyze a line search Newton-Noda method (LS-NNM) for computing the positive $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair of nonnegative tensors. The proposed method integrates Newton method with Noda iteration. The Newton equation is derived from an equivalent nonlinear system, while the eigenvalue sequence is updated by the strategy of the Noda iteration and its variants. To ensure global convergence, we introduce a positivity-preserving line search procedure based on an equivalent constrained optimization problem. The global and quadratic convergence of LS-NNM are established for the class of $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem that admits a unique positive $(\boldsymbol{\sigma},\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair, as guaranteed by the Perron-Frobenius theorem. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of LS-NNM.</description>

      <title>Koopman for stochastic dynamics: error bounds for kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove $L^\infty$-error bounds for kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD) approximants of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems. To this end, we establish Koopman invariance of suitably chosen reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and provide an in-depth analysis of the pointwise error in terms of the data points. The latter is split into two parts by showing that kEDMD for stochastic systems involves a kernel regression step leading to a deterministic error in the fill distance as well as Monte Carlo sampling to approximate unknown expected values yielding a probabilistic error in terms of the number of samples. We illustrate the derived bounds by means of Langevin-type stochastic differential equations involving a nonlinear double-well potential.</description>

      <title>An immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational modeling and simulation of fluid-structure interactions constitute a fundamental cornerstone for advancing aerospace engineering endeavors. This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes.</description>

      <title>DeepONet-accelerated Bayesian inversion for moving boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Corrections by Continuous Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite element methods typically require a high resolution to satisfactorily approximate micro and even macro patterns of an underlying physical model. This issue can be circumvented by appropriate multiscale strategies that are able to obtain reasonable approximations on under-resolved scales. In this paper, we study the implicit neural representation and propose a continuous super-resolution network as a correction strategy for multiscale effects. It can take coarse finite element data to learn both in-distribution and out-of-distribution high-resolution finite element predictions. Our highlight is the design of a local implicit transformer, which is able to learn multiscale features. We also propose Gabor wavelet-based coordinate encodings, which can overcome the bias of neural networks learning low-frequency features. Finally, perception is often preferred over distortion, so scientists can recognize the visual pattern for further investigation. However, implicit neural representation is known for its lack of local pattern supervision. We propose to use stochastic cosine similarities to compare the local feature differences between prediction and ground truth. It shows better performance on structural alignments. Our experiments show that our proposed strategy achieves superior performance as an in-distribution and out-of-distribution super-resolution strategy.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Robust Preconditioners for A Four-Field Thermo-Poroelasticity Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a thermo-poroelasticity model which describes the interaction between the deformation of an elastic porous material and fluid flow under non-isothermal conditions. The model involves several parameters that can vary significantly in practical applications, posing a challenge for developing discretization techniques and solution algorithms that handle such variations effectively. We propose a four-field formulation and apply a conforming finite element discretization. The primary focus is on constructing and analyzing preconditioners for the resulting linear system. Two preconditioners are proposed: one involves regrouping variables and treating the 4-by-4 system as a 2-by-2 block form, while the other is directly constructed from the 4-by-4 coupled operator. Both preconditioners are demonstrated to be robust with respect to variations in parameters and mesh refinement. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners and validate their theoretical performance under varying parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable reduced order modeling of nonlinear conservation laws using discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) are inexpensive surrogate models that reduce costs associated with many-query scenarios. Current methods for constructing entropy stable ROMs for nonlinear conservation laws utilize full order models (FOMs) based on finite volume methods (FVMs). This work describes how to generalize the construction of entropy stable ROMs from FVM FOMs to high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) FOMs. Significant innovations of our work include the introduction of a new "test basis" which significantly improves accuracy for DG FOMs, a dimension-by-dimension hyper-reduction strategy, and a simplification of the boundary hyper-reduction step based on "Carath\'eodory pruning".</description>

      <title>Generators of $H^1(\Gamma, \partial \Gamma^c)$ with $\partial \Gamma^c \subset \partial \Gamma$ for Triangulated Surfaces $\Gamma$: Construction and Classification of Global Loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact surface $\Gamma$ embedded in $\mathbb R^3$ with boundary $\partial \Gamma$, our goal is to construct a set of representatives for a basis of the relative cohomology group $H^1(\Gamma, \partial \Gamma^c)$, where $\Gamma^c$ is a specified subset of $\partial \Gamma$. To achieve this, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm with two key features: it is applicable to non-orientable surfaces, thereby generalizing the construction of Hiptmair and Ostrowski [SIAM J. Comput., 31 (2002)], and it has a worst-case time complexity that is linear in the number of edges of the mesh $\mathcal K$ triangulating $\Gamma$. Importantly, this algorithm serves as a critical pre-processing step to address the low-frequency breakdown encountered in boundary element discretizations of integral equation formulations.</description>

      <title>The role of boundary constraints in simulating a nonlocal Gray-Scott model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a second-order algorithm for approximating solutions to nonlocal diffusive processes in reaction-diffusion equations. The numerical scheme relies on a quadrature method for the spatial discretization and a second-order Adams-Bashford method for the time marching. This algorithm is then used to simulate a nonlocal Gray-Scott model, known for generating interesting structures including periodic patterns, traveling waves, pulse and multi-pulse solutions. Our main goal is to study the impact of boundary constraints on the formation of stationary pulse solutions. We consider nonlocal Dirichlet and Neumann boundary constraints, as well as what we refer to as `free' boundary conditions. In addition, we investigate the effects of using different convolution kernels, fat- or thin-tailed, on the formation of these localized solutions. Our numerical results show that when the spread of the kernel is large, i.e. when the model is nonlocal, both the type of kernel and the type of boundary constraint used have a strong impact on the solution's profile.</description>

      <title>Dual Formulation Finite-Volume Methods on Overlapping Meshes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce new second-order schemes for one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Following an approach recently proposed in [{\sc R. Abgrall}, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5 (2023), pp. 370--402], we consider two different formulations of the studied system (the original conservative formulation and a primitive one containing nonconservative products), and discretize them on overlapping staggered meshes using two different numerical schemes. The novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we introduce an original paradigm making use of overlapping finite-volume (FV) meshes over which cell averages of conservative and primitive variables are evolved using semi-discrete FV methods: The nonconservative system is discretized by a path-conservative central-upwind scheme, and its solution is used to evaluate very simple numerical fluxes for the discretization of the original conservative system. Second, to ensure the nonlinear stability of the resulting method, we design a post-processing, which also guarantees a conservative coupling between the two sets of variables. We test the proposed semi-discrete dual formulation finite-volume methods on several benchmarks for the Euler equations of gas dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Stiff Order Condition Theory for Runge-Kutta Methods Applied to Semilinear ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical convergence theory of Runge-Kutta methods assumes that the time step is small relative to the Lipschitz constant of the ordinary differential equation (ODE). For stiff problems, that assumption is often violated, and a problematic degradation in accuracy, known as order reduction, can arise. Methods with high stage order, e.g., Gauss-Legendre and Radau, are known to avoid order reduction, but they must be fully implicit. For the broad class of semilinear ODEs, which consist of a stiff linear term and non-stiff nonlinear term, we show that weaker conditions suffice. Our new semilinear order conditions are formulated in terms of orthogonality relations and can be enumerated by rooted trees. Finally, we prove global error bounds that hold uniformly with respect to stiffness of the linear term.</description>

Abstract: DefElement is an online encyclopedia of finite element definitions that was created and is maintained by the authors of this paper. DefElement aims to make information about elements defined in the literature easily available in a standard format. There are a number of open-source finite element libraries available, and it can be difficult to check that an implementation of an element in a library matches the element's definition in the literature or implementation in another library, especially when many libraries include variants of elements whose basis functions do not match exactly. In this paper, we carefully derive conditions under which elements can be considered equivalent and describe an algorithm that uses these conditions to verify that two implementations of a finite element are indeed variants of the same element. The results of scheduled runs of our implementation of this verification algorithm are included in the information available on the DefElement website.</description>

      <title>Noise-robust multi-fidelity surrogate modelling for parametric partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of constructing noise-robust surrogate models for quantities of interest (QoIs) arising from parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), using multi-fidelity collocation techniques; specifically, the Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC). In practical scenarios, the PDE evaluations used to build a response surface are often corrupted by numerical noise, especially for the low-fidelity models. This noise, which may originate from loose solver tolerances, coarse discretisations, or transient effects, can lead to overfitting in MISC, degrading surrogate quality through nonphysical oscillations and loss of convergence, thereby limiting its utility in downstream tasks like uncertainty quantification, optimisation, and control. To correct this behaviour, we propose an improved version of MISC that can automatically detect the presence of solver noise during the surrogate model construction and then ignore the exhausted fidelities. Our approach monitors the spectral decay of the surrogate at each iteration, identifying stagnation in the coefficient spectrum that signals the onset of noise. Once detected, the algorithm selectively halts the use of noisy fidelities, focusing computational resources on those fidelities that still provide meaningful information. The effectiveness of this approach is numerically validated on two challenging test cases: a parabolic advection--diffusion PDE with uncertain coefficients, and a parametric turbulent incompressible Navier--Stokes problem. The results showcase the accuracy and robustness of the resulting multi-fidelity surrogate and its capability to extract relevant information, even from under-resolved meshes not suitable for reliable single-fidelity computations.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic finite volume method (SFV method) is a high-order accurate method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in hyperbolic conservation laws. However, the computational cost of SFV method increases for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we incorporate interpolation-based reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques that reduce the cost of computing stochastic integrals in SFV method. Further efficiency gains are achieved through a Q-DEIM hyper-reduction method. Numerical experiments suggest that this approach can lower both computational cost and memory requirements for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-uniformity is a fundamental geometric property of point sets, crucial for applications such as kernel interpolation, Gaussian process regression, and space-filling experimental designs. While quasi-Monte Carlo methods are widely recognized for their low-discrepancy characteristics, understanding their quasi-uniformity remains important for practical applications. For the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence, Sobol' and Shukhman (2007) conjectured that the separation radius of the first $N$ points achieves the optimal rate $N^{-1/2}$, which would imply quasi-uniformity. This conjecture was disproved by Goda (2024), who computed exact values of the $\ell^2$-separation radius for a sparse subsequence $N = 2^{2^v-1}$. However, the general behavior of the Sobol' sequence for arbitrary $N$ remained unclear. In this paper, we derive exact expressions for the $\ell^\infty$-separation radius of the first $N = 2^m$ points of the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. As an immediate consequence, we show that the separation radius of Sobol' points is $O(N^{-3/4})$, which is strictly worse than the optimal rate $N^{-1/2}$, revealing that the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence has a suboptimal mesh ratio that grows at least as $N^{1/4}$.</description>

Abstract: Recursive algorithms for computing the Frobenius norm of a real array are proposed, based on hypot, a hypotenuse function. Comparing their relative accuracy bounds with those of the BLAS routine DNRM2 it is shown that the proposed algorithms could in many cases be significantly more accurate. The scalar recursive algorithms are vectorized with the Intel's vector instructions to achieve performance comparable to DNRM2, and are further parallelized with OpenCilk. Some scalar algorithms are unconditionally bitwise reproducible, while the reproducibility of the vector ones depends on the vector width. A modification of the proposed algorithms to compute the vector $p$-norm is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To avoid ineffective collisions between the equilibrium states, the hybrid method with deviational particles (HDP) has been proposed to integrate the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system, while leaving a new issue in sampling deviational particles from the high-dimensional source term. In this paper, we present an adaptive sampling (AS) strategy that first adaptively reconstructs a piecewise constant approximation of the source term based on sequential clustering via discrepancy estimation, and then samples deviational particles directly from the resulting adaptive piecewise constant function without rejection. The mixture discrepancy, which can be easily calculated thanks to its explicit analytical expression, is employed as a measure of uniformity instead of the star discrepancy the calculation of which is NP-hard. The resulting method, dubbed the HDP-AS method, samples deviational particles through adaptive sampling instead of the acceptance-rejection method in the original HDP method. In the Landau damping, two stream instability, bump on tail and Rosenbluth's test problems, the HDP-AS method runs approximately ten times faster than the HDP method while keeping the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>mLaSDI: Multi-stage latent space dynamics identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential across many scientific disciplines. However, high-fidelity solvers can be computationally prohibitive, motivating the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the training data via an autoencoder and learns user-specified ordinary differential equations (ODEs), governing the latent dynamics, enabling rapid predictions for unseen parameters. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous problems, the autoencoder must simultaneously reconstruct the training data and satisfy the imposed latent dynamics, which are often competing objectives that limit accuracy, particularly for complex or high-frequency phenomena. To address this limitation, we propose multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, we train LaSDI sequentially in stages. After training the initial autoencoder, we train additional decoders which map the latent trajectories to residuals from previous stages. This staged residual learning, combined with periodic activation functions, enables recovery of high-frequency content without sacrificing interpretability of the latent dynamics. Numerical experiments on a multiscale oscillating system, unsteady wake flow, and the 1D-1V Vlasov equation demonstrate that mLaSDI achieves significantly lower reconstruction and prediction errors, often by an order of magnitude, while requiring less training time and reduced hyperparameter tuning compared to standard LaSDI.</description>

Abstract: Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate reconstruction of myocardial displacement fields from sparse clinical imaging data, yet current methods often demand intrusive access to computational models. In this work, we apply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to three-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires only solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver access -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes using different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP) algorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques exploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model with simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we systematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking realistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in noise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance with 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective reconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)). The online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction times under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant potential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows.</description>
