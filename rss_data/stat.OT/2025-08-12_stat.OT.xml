      <title>The p-value from a fuzzy point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to provide a new way of seeing the p-value in terms of a fuzzy membership function. According to the ASAs statement, we aim at removing the arbitrary choice of the significance level and at demonstrating that the p-value can be profitably interpreted from a fuzzy point of view. In particular, we propose a new class of membership functions by viewing the p-value as a function of the null hypothesis and we apply our approach to compare two independent binomial proportions. The proposed membership functions can also be employed to assess the precision of confidence intervals and the power of statistical tests.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Consistency and Generalization in Hybrid Models of Regularized Selection and Nonlinear Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how different types of supervised models perform in the task of predicting and selecting relevant variables in high-dimensional contexts, especially when the data is very noisy. We analyzed three approaches: regularized models (such as Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net), black-box models (such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and H2O GBM), and hybrid models that combine both approaches: regularization with nonlinear algorithms. Based on simulations inspired by the Friedman equation, we evaluated 23 models using three complementary metrics: RMSE, Jaccard index, and recall rate. The results reveal that, although black-box models excel in predictive accuracy, they lack interpretability and simplicity, essential factors in many real-world contexts. Regularized models, on the other hand, proved to be more sensitive to an excess of irrelevant variables. In this scenario, hybrid models stood out for their balance: they maintain good predictive performance, identify relevant variables more consistently, and offer greater robustness, especially as the sample size increases. Therefore, we recommend using this hybrid framework in market applications, where it is essential that the results make sense in a practical context and support decisions with confidence.</description>

      <title>Ride-sharing Determinants: Spatial and Spatio-temporal Bayesian Analysis for Chicago Service in 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11590v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of ride-sharing services has caused significant disruptions in the transpor-tation industry and fundamentally altered the way individuals move from one place to another. Accurate estimation of ride-sharing improves service utilization and reliability and reduces travel time and traffic congestion. In this study, we employ two Bayesian models to estimate ride-sharing demand in the 77 Chicago community areas. We consider demographic, scoio-economic, transportation factors as well as land-use characteristics as explanatory variables. Our models assume conditional autoregression (CAR) prior for the explanatory variables. Moreover, the Bayesian frameworks estimate both the unstructured random error and the struc-tured errors for the spatial and the spatiotemporal correlation. We assessed the performance of the estimated models and the residuals of the spatial regression model have no left-over spatial structure. For the spatiotemporal model, the squared correlation between actual ride-shares and the fitted values is 0.95. Our analysis revealed that the demographic factors (populations size and registered crimes) positively impact the ride-sharing demand. Additionally, the ride-sharing demand increases with higher income and increase in the economically active propor-tion of the population as well as the residents with no cars. Moreover, the transit availability and the walkability indices are crucial determinants for the ridesharing in Chicago.</description>

      <title>A Review and Classification of Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model uncertainty is a crucial issue in statistics, econometrics and machine learning, yet its definition remains ambiguous and is subject to various interpretations in the literature. So far, there has not been a universally accepted definition of model uncertainty. We review different understandings of model uncertainty and categorize them into three distinct types: uncertainty about the true model, model selection uncertainty, and model selection instability. We further offer interpretations and examples for a better illustration of these definitions. We also discuss the potential consequences of neglecting model uncertainty in the process of conducting statistical inference, and provide effective solutions to these problems. Our aim is to help researchers better understand the concept of model uncertainty and obtain valid statistical inference results on the premise of its existence.</description>
