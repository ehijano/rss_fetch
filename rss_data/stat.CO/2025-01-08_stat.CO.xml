      <title>Grid Particle Gibbs with Ancestor Sampling for State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the challenge of estimating the model parameters and latent states of general state-space models within a Bayesian framework. We extend the commonly applied particle Gibbs framework by proposing an efficient particle generation scheme for the latent states. The approach efficiently samples particles using an approximate hidden Markov model (HMM) representation of the general state-space model via a deterministic grid on the state space. We refer to the approach as the grid particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling algorithm. We discuss several computational and practical aspects of the algorithm in detail and highlight further computational adjustments that improve the efficiency of the algorithm. The efficiency of the approach is investigated via challenging regime-switching models, including a post-COVID tourism demand model, and we demonstrate substantial computational gains compared to previous particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Spline Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantile regression is a powerful tool capable of offering a richer view of the data as compared to linear-squares regression. Quantile regression is typically performed individually on a few quantiles or a grid of quantiles without considering the similarity of the underlying regression coefficients at nearby quantiles. When needed, an ad hoc post-processing procedure such as kernel smoothing is employed to smooth the estimated coefficients across quantiles and thereby improve the performance of these estimates. This paper introduces a new method, called spline quantile regression (SQR), that unifies quantile regression with quantile smoothing and jointly estimates the regression coefficients across quantiles as smoothing splines. We discuss the computation of the SQR solution as a linear program (LP) using an interior-point algorithm. We also experiment with some gradient algorithms that require less memory than the LP algorithm. The performance of the SQR method and these algorithms is evaluated using simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Fast data inversion for high-dimensional dynamical systems from noisy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a scalable approach for a flexible latent factor model for high-dimensional dynamical systems. Each latent factor process has its own correlation and variance parameters, and the orthogonal factor loading matrix can be either fixed or estimated. We utilize an orthogonal factor loading matrix that avoids computing the inversion of the posterior covariance matrix at each time of the Kalman filter, and derive closed-form expressions in an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation, which substantially reduces the computational complexity without approximation. Our study is motivated by inversely estimating slow slip events from geodetic data, such as continuous GPS measurements. Extensive simulated studies illustrate higher accuracy and scalability of our approach compared to alternatives. By applying our method to geodetic measurements in the Cascadia region, our estimated slip better agrees with independently measured seismic data of tremor events. The substantial acceleration from our method enables the use of massive noisy data for geological hazard quantification and other applications.</description>

      <title>Fast and light-weight energy statistics using the \textit{R} package \textsf{Rfast}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy statistics ($\mathcal{\varepsilon}$-statistics) are functions of distances between statistical observations. This class of functions has enabled the development of non-linear statistical concepts, termed distance variance, distance covariance, distance correlation, etc. The computational burden associated with the $\mathcal{\varepsilon}$-statistical quantities is really heavy and when the data reside in the multivariate space, the task becomes even harder. We alleviate this cost by tremendously reducing the memory requirements and essentially making the computations faster. We show the process for the cases of (univariate and multivariate) distance variance, distance covariance, (partial) distance correlation, energy distance and hypothesis testing for the equality of univariate distributions.</description>
