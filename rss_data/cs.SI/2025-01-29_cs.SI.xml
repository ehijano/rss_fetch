      <title>More Efficient Sybil Detection Mechanisms Leveraging Resistance of Users to Attack Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of sybil (fake account) detection in social networks from a graph algorithms perspective, where graph structural information is used to classify users as sybil and benign. We introduce the novel notion of user resistance to attack requests (friendship requests from sybil accounts). Building on this notion, we propose a synthetic graph data generation framework that supports various attack strategies. We then study the optimization problem where we are allowed to reveal the resistance of a subset of users with the aim to maximize the number of users which are discovered to be benign and the number of potential attack edges (connections from a sybil to a benign user). Furthermore, we devise efficient algorithms for this problem and investigate their theoretical guarantees. Finally, through a large set of experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms improve detection performance notably when applied as a preprocessing step for different sybil detection algorithms.

      <title>Examining Online Social Support for Countering QAnon Conspiracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As radical messaging has proliferated on social networking sites, platforms like Reddit have been used to host support groups, including support communities for the families and friends of radicalized individuals. This study examines the subreddit r/QAnonCasualties, an online forum for users whose loved ones have been radicalized by QAnon. We collected 1,665 posts and 78,171 comments posted between 7/2021 and 7/2022 and content coded top posts for prominent themes. Sentiment analysis was also conducted on all posts. We find venting, advice and validation-seeking, and pressure to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine were prominent themes. 40% (n=167) of coded posts identified the Q relation(s) of users as their parent(s) and 16.3% (n=68) as their partner. Posts with higher proportions of words related to swearing, social referents, and physical needs were positively correlated with engagement. These findings show ways that communities around QAnon adherents leverage anonymous online spaces to seek and provide social support.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Risk Assessment Factors and Metrics to Evaluate Radicalisation in Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, Social Networks have become an essential communication tools producing a large amount of information about their users and their interactions, which can be analysed with Data Mining methods. In the last years, Social Networks are being used to radicalise people. In this paper, we study the performance of a set of indicators and their respective metrics, devoted to assess the risk of radicalisation of a precise individual on three different datasets. Keyword-based metrics, even though depending on the written language, performs well when measuring frustration, perception of discrimination as well as declaration of negative and positive ideas about Western society and Jihadism, respectively. However, metrics based on frequent habits such as writing ellipses are not well enough to characterise a user in risk of radicalisation. The paper presents a detailed description of both, the set of indicators used to asses the radicalisation in Social Networks and the set of datasets used to evaluate them. Finally, an experimental study over these datasets are carried out to evaluate the performance of the metrics considered.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Network Structure of Anti-Trans Actors on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of short form video social media sites such as TikTok has been effectively utilized for increased visibility, communication, and community connection amongst trans/nonbinary creators online. However, these same platforms have also been exploited by right-wing actors targeting trans/nonbinary people, enabling such anti-trans actors to efficiently spread hate speech and propaganda. Given these divergent groups, what are the differences in network structure between anti-trans and pro-trans communities on TikTok, and to what extent do they amplify the effects of anti-trans content? In this paper, we collect a sample of TikTok videos containing pro and anti-trans content, and develop a taxonomy of trans related sentiment to enable the classification of content on TikTok, and ultimately analyze the reply network structures of pro-trans and anti-trans communities. In order to accomplish this, we worked with hired expert data annotators from the trans/nonbinary community in order to generate a sample of highly accurately labeled data. From this subset, we utilized a novel classification pipeline leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with annotated examples and taxonomy definitions to classify content into pro-trans, anti-trans, or neutral categories. We find that incorporating our taxonomy and its logics into our classification engine results in improved ability to differentiate trans related content, and that Results from network analysis indicate many interactions between posters of pro-trans and anti-trans content exist, further demonstrating targeting of trans individuals, and demonstrating the need for better content moderation tools</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Diffusion for High-Order Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems rely on Collaborative Filtering (CF) to predict user preferences by leveraging patterns in historical user-item interactions. While traditional CF methods primarily focus on learning compact vector embeddings for users and items, graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have emerged as a powerful alternative, utilizing the structure of user-item interaction graphs to enhance recommendation accuracy. However, existing GNN-based models, such as LightGCN and UltraGCN, often struggle with two major limitations: an inability to fully account for heterophilic interactions, where users engage with diverse item categories, and the over-smoothing problem in multi-layer GNNs, which hinders their ability to model complex, high-order relationships. To address these gaps, we introduce WaveHDNN, an innovative wavelet-enhanced hypergraph diffusion framework. WaveHDNN integrates a Heterophily-aware Collaborative Encoder, designed to capture user-item interactions across diverse categories, with a Multi-scale Group-wise Structure Encoder, which leverages wavelet transforms to effectively model localized graph structures. Additionally, cross-view contrastive learning is employed to maintain robust and consistent representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of WaveHDNN, demonstrating its superior ability to capture both heterophilic and localized structural information, leading to improved recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Polarization and Disagreement in the Friedkin-Johnsen Model with Unknown Innate Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk of the literature on opinion optimization in social networks adopts the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, in which the innate opinions of all nodes are known: this is an unrealistic assumption. In this paper, we study opinion optimization under the FJ model without the full knowledge of innate opinions. Specifically, we borrow from the literature a series of objective functions, aimed at minimizing polarization and/or disagreement, and we tackle the budgeted optimization problem, where we can query the innate opinions of only a limited number of nodes. Given the complexity of our problem, we propose a framework based on three steps: (1) select the limited number of nodes we query, (2) reconstruct the innate opinions of all nodes based on those queried, and (3) optimize the objective function with the reconstructed opinions. For each step of the framework, we present and systematically evaluate several effective strategies. A key contribution of our work is a rigorous error propagation analysis that quantifies how reconstruction errors in innate opinions impact the quality of the final solutions. Our experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets show that we can effectively minimize polarization and disagreement even if we have quite limited information about innate opinions.</description>

      <title>Fast Flocking of Protesters on Street Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of protesters scattered throughout a city who want to gather into large and mobile groups. This model relies on random walkers on a street network that follow tactics built from a set of basic rules. Our goal is to identify the most important rules for fast and robust flocking of walkers. We explore a wide set of tactics and show the central importance of a specific rule based on alignment. Other rules alone perform poorly, but our experiments show that combining alignment with them enhances flocking, and that obtained groups are then remarkably robust.</description>

      <title>A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we analyse 3D models of cultural heritage with the aim of answering three main questions: what processes can be put in place to create a FAIR-by-design digital twin of a temporary exhibition? What are the main challenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies and how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data management perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review touching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation models; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance Information (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed history and origin of an object, and - on the other hand - the detailed history and origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether physical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their creation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe the process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and modelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the many steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects (DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised DCHO onto a web-based framework (ATON), with a focus on open technologies and standards for interoperability and preservation. Using the FAIR Principles for Heritage Library, Archive and Museum Collections [1] as a framework, we look in detail at how the Digital Twin implements FAIR principles at the object and metadata level. We then describe the main challenges we encountered and we summarise what seem to be the peculiarities of 3D cultural heritage data and the possible directions for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Community-centric modeling of citation dynamics explains collective citation patterns in science, law, and patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many human knowledge systems, such as science, law, and invention, are built on documents and the citations that link them. Citations, while serving multiple purposes, primarily function as a way to explicitly document the use of prior work and thus have become central to the study of knowledge systems. Analyzing citation dynamics has revealed statistical patterns that shed light on knowledge production, recognition, and formalization, and has helped identify key mechanisms driving these patterns. However, most quantitative findings are confined to scientific citations, raising the question of universality of these findings. Moreover, existing models of individual citation trajectories fail to explain phenomena such as delayed recognition, calling for a unifying framework. Here, we analyze a newly available corpus of U.S. case law, in addition to scientific and patent citation networks, to show that they share remarkably similar citation patterns, including a heavy-tailed distribution of sleeping beauties. We propose a holistic model that captures the three core mechanisms driving collective dynamics and replicates the elusive phenomenon of delayed recognition. We demonstrate that the model not only replicates observed citation patterns, but also better predicts future successes by considering the whole system. Our work offers insights into key mechanisms that govern large-scale patterns of collective human knowledge systems and may provide generalizable perspectives on discovery and innovation across domains.</description>
