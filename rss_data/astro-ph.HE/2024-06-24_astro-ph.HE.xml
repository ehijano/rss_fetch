      <title>Multistructured accretion flow of Sgr A* I: Examination of a RIAF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme low-luminosity supermassive black hole Sgr A* provides a unique laboratory in which to test radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. Previous fits to the quiescent Chandra ACIS-S spectrum found a RIAF model with an equal inflow-outflow balance works well. In this work, we apply the RIAF model to the Chandra HETG-S spectrum obtained through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program, which displays features suggestive of temperature and velocity structures within the plasma. A comprehensive forward model analysis accounting for the accretion flow geometry and HETG-S instrumental effects is required for a full interpretation of the quiescent Chandra HETG-S spectrum. We present a RIAF model that takes these effects into account. Our fits to the high-resolution gratings spectrum indicate an inflow balanced by an outflow ($s \sim 1$) alongside a temperature profile that appears shallower than what would be expected from a gravitational potential following $1/r$. The data require that the abundance of Iron relative to solar is $Z_{Fe} &lt; 0.32 Z_\odot$ (90\% credible interval), much lower than the $2~Z_\odot$ metallicity measured in nearby late-type giants. While future missions like NewAthena will provide higher spectral resolution, source separation will continue to be a problem. Leveraging Chandra's unparalleled spatial resolution, which is not expected to be surpassed for decades, remains essential for detailed investigations of the densely populated Galactic Center in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Multistructured accretion flow of Sgr A* II: Signatures of a Cool Accretion Disk in Hydrodynamic Simulations of Stellar Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations of the stellar winds from Wolf-Rayet stars within the Galactic Center can provide predictions for the X-ray spectrum of supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Herein, we present results from updated smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations, building on the architecture of Cuadra et al. (2015); Russell et al. (2017), finding that a cold gas disk forms around Sgr A* with a simulation runtime of 3500 years. This result is consistent with previous grid-based simulations, demonstrating that a cold disk can form regardless of numerical method. We examine the plasma scenarios arising from an environment with and without this cold disk, by generating synthetic spectra for comparison to the quiescent Fe K alpha Sgr A* spectrum from Chandra HETG-S, taken through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program. We find that current and future X-ray missions are unlikely to distinguish between the kinematic signatures in the plasma in these two scenarios. Nonetheless, the stellar wind plasma model presents a good fit to the dispersed Chandra spectra within 1.5" of Sgr A*. We compare our results to the Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) model fit to the HETG-S spectrum presented in Paper I and find that the Bayesian model evidence does not strongly favor either model. With 9" angular resolution and high spectral resolution of the X-IFU, NewAthena will offer a clearer differentiation between the RIAF plasma model and hydrodynamic simulations, but only a future X-ray mission with arcsecond resolution will significantly advance our understanding of Sgr A*'s accretion flow in X-rays.</description>

      <title>The Unexpected Lack of Asymmetry in the Horizon-Scale Image of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ring-like images of the two supermassive black holes captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide powerful probes of the physics of accretion flows at horizon scales. Specifically, the brightness asymmetry in the images carries information about the angular velocity profile of the inner accretion flow and the inclination of the observer, owing to the Doppler boosts photons experience at their site of emission. In this paper, we develop a method for quantifying the brightness asymmetry of black-hole images in the Fourier domain, which can be measured directly from interferometric data. We apply this method to current EHT data and find that the image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) has an unusually low degree of asymmetry that is even lower than that inferred for M87. We then use a covariant semi-analytic model to obtain constraints on the inclinations and velocity profiles of the inner accretion flow for Sgr A*. We find that the lack of significant brightness asymmetry forces the observer inclination to uncomfortably small values ($6-10^\circ$), if the plasma velocity follows Keplerian profiles. Alternatively, larger inclination angles can be accommodated if the plasma velocities are significantly sub-Keplerian and the black hole is not spinning rapidly.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive survey of hybrid equations of state in neutron star mergers and constraints on the hadron-quark phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an extensive study of equation of state (EoS) models featuring a phase transition from hadronic to deconfined quark matter in neutron star merger simulations. We employ three different hadronic EoSs, a constant speed of sound parameterization for the quark phase and a Maxwell construction to generate a large sample of hybrid EoS models. We systematically vary the onset density and density jump of the phase transition as well as the quark matter stiffness and simulate binary neutron star mergers to infer how the properties of the phase transition affect the gravitational-wave signal. In total we simulate mergers with 245 different hybrid EoS models. In particular, we explore in which scenarios a phase transition would be detectable by a characteristically increased postmerger gravitational-wave frequency compared to an estimate from the inspiral signal assuming a purely hadronic EoS. We find that the density jump at the transition (latent heat) has the largest impact on the gravitational-wave frequencies, while the influence of the stiffness of quark matter is smaller. We quantify which range of phase transition properties would be compatible with a certain magnitude or absence of the gravitational-wave postmerger frequency shift. By means of these dependencies, a future detection will thus directly yield constraints on the allowed features of the hadron-quark phase transition.</description>

      <title>To explain the muon excess phenomenon in cosmic rays based on the gluon condensation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are often characterized indirectly by analyzing the properties of secondary cosmic ray particles produced in the collisions with air nuclei, the particle number $N_\mu$ of muon and the depth of shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$ after air shower cascade are mostly studied to infer the energy and mass of the incident cosmic rays. While, researches have shown that there is a significant excess comparing the observed number of muons arriving at the ground from extensive air showers (EAS) with the simulations by using the existing cosmic ray hadronic interaction model. To explain this muon excess phenomenon, a new theoretical model, the gluon condensation model (GC model), is introduced in this paper and simulated by using the AIRES engine. We asumme that the GC effect appearing mainly in the first colliding of the cascade, leads to a significant increase in the strangeness production, accodingly, the production rate of kaons is improved appearantly. The model assumes that only pions and kaons are the new prodcutions in the hadron cascades. It is found that, considering the GC effect, the value of $n_K/n_\pi$ increases and more energy of the incident cosmic rays paticipate in hadron cascades, and then increase the number of mouns finally. This model provides a new theoretical possibility to explain the muon excess puzzle.</description>

      <title>Inference of neutron-star properties with unified crust-core equations of state for parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relating different global neutron-star (NS) properties, such as tidal deformability and radius, or mass and radius, requires an equation of state (EoS). Determining the NS EoS is therefore not only the science goal of a variety of observational projects, but it also enters in the analysis process; for example, to predict a NS radius from a measured tidal deformability via gravitational waves (GW) during the inspiral of a binary NS merger. To this aim, it is important to estimate the theoretical uncertainties on the EoS, one of which is the possible bias coming from an inconsistent treatment of the low-density region; that is, the use of a so called non-unified NS crust. We propose a numerical tool allowing the user to consistently match a nuclear-physics informed crust to an arbitrary high-density EoS describing the core of the star. We introduce an inversion procedure of the EoS close to saturation density that allows users to extract nuclear-matter parameters and extend the EoS to lower densities in a consistent way. For the treatment of inhomogeneous matter in the crust, a standard approach based on the compressible liquid-drop (CLD) model approach was used in our work. A Bayesian analysis using a parametric agnostic EoS representation in the high-density region is also presented in order to quantify the uncertainties induced by an inconsistent treatment of the crust. We show that the use of a fixed, realistic-but-inconsistent model for the crust causes small but avoidable errors in the estimation of global NS properties and leads to an underestimation of the uncertainties in the inference of NS properties. Our results highlight the importance of employing a consistent EoS in inference schemes. The numerical tool that we developed to reconstruct such a thermodynamically consistent EoS, CUTER, has been tested and validated for use by the astrophysical community.</description>

      <title>Plunging region emission in the X-ray binary MAXI J0637$-$430</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the second of November 2019 the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J0637$-$430 went into outburst, at the start of which it was observed in a thermal ``disc-dominated'' state. High photon energy (extending above 10 keV) observations taken by the NuSTAR telescope reveal that this thermal spectrum can not be fit by conventional two-component (disc plus corona) approaches which ignore disc emission sourced from within the plunging region of the black hole's spacetime. Instead, these models require a third ``additional'' thermal component to reproduce the data. Using new disc solutions which extend classical models into the plunging region we show that this ``additional'' thermal emission can be explained self-consistently with photons emitted from the accretion flow at radii within the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole. This represents the second low mass X-ray binary, after MAXI J1820+070, with a detection of plunging region emission, suggesting that signatures of this highly relativistic region may well be widespread but not previously widely appreciated. To allow for a detection of the plunging region, the black hole in MAXI J0637$-$430 must be at most moderately spinning, and we constrain the spin to be $a_\bullet &lt; 0.86$ at 99.9$\%$ confidence. We finish by discussing the observational requirements for the robust detection of this region.</description>

      <title>High energy neutrino production in gamma-ray bursts: dependence of the neutrino signal on the jet composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy nuclei can be synthetized or entrained in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with implications on the high-energy neutrino emission. By means of a Monte-Carlo algorithm, we model nuclear cascades and investigate their impact on the neutrino production considering kinetic dominated jets (in the internal shock model, including a dissipative photosphere) as well as Poynting flux dominated jets (for a jet model invoking internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence, ICMART). We find that the ICMART model allows for efficient nuclear cascades leading to an overall larger neutrino fluence than in the other two jet models. The survival of nuclei and inefficient nuclear cascades lead to an overall reduction of the neutrino fluence up to one order of magnitude. However, if nuclei are disintegrated, the neutrino fluence may be comparable to the one emitted from a jet loaded with protons. Exploring the parameter space of jet properties, we conclude that the composition and the bulk Lorentz factor have significant impact on the efficiency of nuclear cascades as well as the spectral shape of the expected neutrino fluence. On the other hand, the neutrino spectral distribution is less sensitive to the power-law index of the accelerated population of protons or heavier nuclei. For what concerns the diffuse emission of neutrinos from GRBs, we find that the uncertainty due to the jet composition can be at most comparable to the one related to the GRB cosmological rate.</description>

      <title>X Persei: A study on the origin of its high-energy emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The origin of the hard X-ray emission in the Be/X-ray binary system X Persei has long been debated as its atypical 'two-hump' spectrum can be modelled in multiple ways. The main debate focuses on the the high-energy hump, which is fit as either a cyclotron resonance scatter frequency (CRSF) or inverse Comptonization due to bulk Comptonization.
  Methods. Using INTEGRAL/JEM-X and ISGRI data, we studied the temporal and spectral variability in the 3-250 keV energy range during observations over ~15 years. A NuSTAR observation was also included in a joint spectral fit with the INTEGRAL spectrum.
  Results. We find that the joint spectrum can be described well by a low-energy component due to thermal Comptonization and a high-energy component due to bulk Comptonization, a CRSF, or a cyclotron emission line. The three models begin to diverge above ~120 keV, where statistics are low.
  Conclusions. We compare our results with observations of other Be/X-ray binaries that show similar 'two-hump' spectra while in a low-luminosity state. As the sources are in a low accretion state, the bulk Comptonization process is likely inefficient, and thus not an explanation for the high-energy component. The broad CRSF (27 +/- 2 keV) in X Persei suggests that the high-energy emission is not due to a CRSF. Thus, the high-energy component is potentially due to cyclotron emission, though other scenarios are not definitively excluded.</description>

      <title>The development of ground-based Gamma-ray astronomy: a historical overview of the pioneering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-based technique for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes became a rapidly developing and powerful branch of science. Thanks to this technique, over 250 very high-energy gamma-ray sources of galactic and extragalactic origin have been discovered. Many fundamental questions of astrophysics, astro-particle physics, the physics of cosmic rays and cosmology are the focus of this technique. In the past 33 years since the discovery of the first gamma-ray source, the Crab Nebula, the discipline has made remarkable progress. Today, the technology boasts highly sensitive telescopes capable of detecting a point source 100 times fainter than the standard candle, the Crab Nebula, in 25 hours of observation. Further developments in this technology led to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the next-generation large instrument. The sensitivity of CTA will be several times higher than that of the current best instruments. This article presents a brief history of ground-based very high energy gamma-ray astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Can cosmic rays explain the high ionisation rates in the Galactic Centre?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{H}_2$ ionisation rate in the Central Molecular Zone, located in the Galactic Centre region, is estimated to be $\zeta\sim2\times10^{-14}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, based on observations of H$_3^+$ lines. This value is 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than that measured anywhere else in the Galaxy. A high cosmic-ray density has been invoked to explain the unusually high ionisation rate. However, this excess is not seen in the $\gamma$-ray emission from this region, which is produced by high-energy cosmic rays. Therefore, an excess is expected only in the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum. Here, we derive constraints on this hypothetical low-energy component in the cosmic-ray spectra and we question its plausibility. To do so, we solve numerically the cosmic-ray transport equation in the Central Molecular Zone, considering spatial diffusion, advection in the Galactic wind, reacceleration in the ambient turbulence, and energy losses due to interactions with matter and radiation in the interstellar medium. We derive stationary solutions under the assumption that cosmic rays are continuously injected by a source located in the Galactic Centre. The high-energy component in the cosmic-ray spectrum is then fitted to available $\gamma$-ray and radio data, and a steep low-energy component is added to the cosmic-ray spectrum to explain the large ionisation rates. We find that injection spectra of $p^{-7}$ for protons below $p_{enh,p}c\simeq780~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $p^{-5.2}$ for electrons below $p_{enh,e}c=1.5~\mathrm{GeV}$ are needed to reach the observed ionisation rates. This corresponds to an extremely large cosmic-ray power of the order $\sim10^{40-41}~\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ injected at the Galactic Centre. We conclude that cosmic rays alone can not explain the high ionisation rates in the Galactic Centre region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse photometric data of nine supernovae (SNe) in filters V, R and I obtained during observational campaigns at the OAUNI site in 2016, 2017 and 2023. The calibrated magnitudes of the observed SNe were compared with their respective light curves available in the literature to study their evolution after their maximum brightness. In some cases, the supernova color-color diagnostic diagram was used to determine our observation date and correctly locate our magnitudes on the light curves. For this purpose, the use of supernova light curve templates, as well as reference supernovae, was also helpful. This work allowed us to verify the feasibility of performing precision astronomical photometry at the OAUNI.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Heavy Asymmetric and Symmetric Dark Matter from the Glashow Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can lead to distinct neutrino signatures characterized by an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. In the high-energy regime, the Glashow resonant interaction $\bar{\nu}_{e} + e^{-} \rightarrow W^{-}$ yields an increase in sensitivity to the neutrino flux, and stands out as the only way of discerning the antineutrino component in the diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. This offers a unique opportunity in the search for dark matter with masses above the PeV scale. We examine the neutrino signal stemming from ADM decay and set the first stringent constraints on ADM lifetime $\tau_X$. For ADM with mass $m_X\gtrsim 10$ PeV, we find $\tau_X\lesssim 10^{29}$s using the data from the recent IceCube search for Glashow resonance events. Our projections further show that sensitivities at the forthcoming IceCube-Gen2 could approach $10^{30}$s, depending on the decay channel. The current constraints on symmetric dark matter decay to neutrinos are also improved by up to a factor of 3 thanks to the Glashow resonance.</description>

      <title>Amplitudes and Polarizations of Quadratic Quasi-Normal Modes for a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity predicts the existence of quadratic quasi-normal modes at second order in perturbation theory. Building on our recent work, we compute the amplitudes and polarizations of these modes for non-rotating black holes, showing that they are completely determined by the amplitudes and polarizations of linear modes. We obtain the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes, which still depends on the initial conditions of the merger through the polarization of linear modes. However, we demonstrate that this dependence is captured by four fundamental numbers, independent of initial conditions, representing four different combinations of linear modes parities. Additionally, we prove two selection rules regarding the vanishing of classes of quadratic modes. Our results are available online as a package which provides the ratio of amplitudes across a broad spectrum of angular momenta.</description>

      <title>New $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates corresponding to the temperature regime of thermonuclear X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reaction rates using the latest experimental input supplemented with theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information. The experimental input consists of the latest proton thresholds of $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As, and the nuclear spectroscopic information of $^{65}$As, whereas the theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information for $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As are deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations with the GXPF1A Hamiltonian. Both thermonuclear reaction rates are determined with known uncertainties at the energies that correspond to the Gamow windows of the temperature regime relevant to Type I X-ray bursts, covering the typical temperature range of the thermonuclear runaway of the GS 1826$-$24 periodic bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts.</description>

      <title>X-raying the zeta Tau binary system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Be star zeta Tau was recently reported to be a gamma Cas analog; that is, it displays an atypical (bright and hard) X-ray emission. The origin of these X-rays remains debated.The first X-ray observations indicated a very large absorption of the hot plasma component (N_H~ 10^{23}/cm^2). This is most probably related to the edge-on configuration of the zeta Tau disk. If the X-ray emission arises close to the companion, an orbital modulation of the absorption could be detected as the disk comes in and out of the line of sight. New XMM-Newton data were obtained to characterize the high-energy properties of zeta Tau in more detail. They are complemented by previous Chandra and SRG/eROSITA observations as well as by optical spectroscopy and TESS photometry. The high-quality XMM-Newton data reveal the presence of a faint soft X-ray emission, which appears in line with that recorded for non-gamma Cas Be stars. In addition, zeta Tau exhibits significant short-term variability at all energies, with larger amplitudes at lower frequencies (``red noise''), as is found in X-ray data of other gamma Cas stars. Transient variability (softness dip, low-frequency signal) may also be detected at some epochs. In addition, between X-ray exposures, large variations in the spectra are detected in the 1.5-4.keV energy band. They are due to large changes in absorption toward the hottest (9keV) plasma. These changes are not correlated with either the orbital phase or the depth of the shell absorption of the Halpha line. These observed properties are examined in the light of proposed gamma Cas models.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Star Properties with NJL and MFTQCD Model: A Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. The possible existence of hybrid stars is investigated using microscopic models to describe the different phases of matter. Within these microscopic models we aim at calculating the properties of neutron stars and matter. We want to probe the influence of pQCD calculations and analyze the properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. A Bayesian approach using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling process is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state. A Maxwell construction describes the deconfinement transition. For the hadronic phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with non-linear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use two different models: the NJL model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, similar to the MIT bag model with a vector term. The model parameters were determined by Bayesian inference imposing observations from NICER and the phase transition density range. We have also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The restrictions of pQCD reduce the value of the maximum mass. However, even when applying this restriction, the models were able to reach 2.1 to 2.3 solar masses. The conformal limit was not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above two solar masses. The multiquark interactions affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <title>Transport parameters from AMS-02 F/Si data and fluorine source abundance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMS-02 collaboration recently released cosmic-ray F/Si data of unprecedented accuracy. Cosmic-ray (CR) fluorine is predominantly produced by fragmentation of heavier progenitors, while silicon is mostly accelerated at source. This ratio is thus maximally sensitive to CR propagation. We study the compatibility of the transport parameters derived from the F/Si ratio with those obtained from the lighter (Li,Be,B)/C ratios. We also inspect the CR source abundance of F, one of the few elements with a high first ionisation potential but only moderately volatile, and a potentially key element to study the acceleration mechanism of CRs. We use the 1D diffusion model implemented in the USINE code and perform $\chi^2$ analyses accounting for several systematic effects (energy correlations in data, nuclear cross sections and solar modulation uncertainties). We also take advantage of the EXFOR nuclear database to update the F production cross sections for its most important progenitors (identified to be 56Fe, 32S, 28Si, 27Al, 24Mg, 22Ne, and 20Ne). The transport parameters obtained from AMS-02 F/Si data are compatible with those obtained from AMS-02 (Li,Be,B)/C data. The combined fit of all these ratios leads to a chi2/dof$\approx 1.1$, with $\lesssim 10\%$ adjustments of the B and F production cross sections (the latter are based on very few nuclear data points, and would strongly benefit from new measurements). The F/Si ratio is compatible with a pure secondary origin of F, with a best-fit relative source abundance (19F/28Si)$\sim 10^{-3}$ and an upper limit of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$. Unfortunately, this limit is not sufficient to test global acceleration models of CR nuclei, for which values at the level of $\sim 10^{-4}$ are required. Such levels could be attained with F/Si data of a few percent accuracy at a few tens of TV, possibly within reach of the next generation of CR experiments.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing binary black hole precessional morphologies with gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precessional motion of binary black holes can be classified into one of three morphologies, based on the evolution of the angle between the components of the spins in the orbital plane: Circulating, librating around 0, and librating around $\pi$. These different morphologies can be related to the binary's formation channel and are imprinted in the binary's gravitational wave signal. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model selection method to determine the preferred spin morphology of a detected binary black hole. The method involves a fast calculation of the morphology which allows us to restrict to a specific morphology in the Bayesian stochastic sampling. We investigate the prospects for distinguishing between the different morphologies using gravitational waves in the Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo network with their plus-era sensitivities. For this, we consider fiducial high- and low-mass binaries having different spin magnitudes and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We find that in the cases with high spin and high SNR, the true morphology is strongly favored with $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors $\gtrsim 4$ compared to both alternative morphologies when the binary's parameters are not close to the boundary between morphologies. However, when the binary parameters are close to the boundary between morphologies, only one alternative morphology is strongly disfavored. In the low-spin, high-SNR cases, the true morphology is still favored with a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor $\sim 2$ compared to one alternative morphology. We also consider the gravitational wave signal from GW200129_065458 that has some evidence for precession (modulo data quality issues) and find that there is no preference for a specific morphology. Our method for restricting the prior to a given morphology is publicly available through an easy-to-use Python package called bbh_spin_morphology_prior. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Energy Dependence of Flavor Instabilities Stemming from Crossings in the Neutrino Flavor Lepton Number Angular Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, the neutrino density is so large that neutrino-neutrino refraction can lead to flavor conversion, if a zero-crossing is present in the neutrino flavor lepton number (FLN) angular distribution and the neutrino self-interaction strength $\mu=\sqrt{2} G_F n_\nu$ represents the characteristic timescale of the system. It has been empirically realized that the vacuum frequency $\omega=\Delta m^2/2E$ affects the development of flavor conversion in the presence of zero-crossing even if $\omega \ll \mu$. Focusing on a homogeneous and axially symmetric neutrino gas, we explore the role of $\omega$ in the onset of flavor instabilities. We find that a non-zero vacuum frequency can be responsible for inducing flavor instabilities even when the neutrino self-interaction strength is much larger than the vacuum frequency. Moreover, mapping a neutrino ensemble with $\omega \neq 0$ into an effective system with $\omega =0$, we find that a system with no FLN zero-crossing can effectively develop one for $\omega \neq 0$ becoming unstable.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black holes as dark matter using AMS-02 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the plausible candidates for the cosmological dark matter. Theoretically, PBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH}$ in the range of $4\times10^{14}\sim 10^{17}\,{\rm g}$ can emit sub-GeV electrons and positrons through Hawking radiation. Some of these particles could undergo diffusive reacceleration during propagation in the Milky Way, potentially reaching energies up to the GeV level observed by AMS-02. In this work, we utilize AMS-02 data to constrain the PBH abundance $f_{\rm PBH}$ by employing the reacceleration mechanism. Under the assumption of a monochromatic PBH mass distribution, our findings reveal that the limit is stricter than that derived from Voyager 1 data. This difference is particularly pronounced when $M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim10^{15}\,{\rm g}$, exceeding an order of magnitude. The constraints are even more robust in a more realistic scenario involving a log-normal mass distribution of PBHs. Moreover, we explore the impact of varying propagation parameters and solar modulation potential within reasonable ranges, and find that such variations have minimal effects on the final results.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin in binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of spin on equal and unequal mass binary neutron star mergers using finite-temperature, composition-dependent Hempel-Schaffner-Bielich (SFHo) equation of state, via 3+1 general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations which take into account neutrino emission and absorption. Equal mass cases that have a mass of $M_{1,2}$ =$1.27$, $1.52$ and $2.05M_{\odot}$, result in a supramassive neutron star, a delayed, and a prompt collapse to a black hole, respectively. For all cases, we analyse the effect of initial spin on dynamics, on the structure of the final remnant, its spin evolution, the amount and composition of the ejected matter, gravitational waves, neutrino energy and luminosities, and disc masses. We show that in equal mass binary neutron star mergers, the ejected mass could reach $\sim0.085M_{\odot}$ for highly aligned-spins ($\chi=0.67$). The black hole which results from such highly spinning, high-mass binary neutron star merger reaches a dimensionless spin of $0.92$; this is the highest spin reached in binary neutron star mergers, to date.</description>

      <title>Closing the net on transient sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed above $4\times10^{19}\,$eV provide evidence of localized excesses that are key to identifying their sources. We leverage the 3D matter distribution from optical and infrared surveys as a density model of UHECR sources, which are considered to be transient. Agreement of the sky model with UHECR data imposes constraints on both the emission rate per unit matter and the time spread induced by encountered turbulent magnetic fields. Based on radio measurements of cosmic magnetism, we identify the Local Sheet as the magnetized structure responsible for the kiloyear duration of UHECR bursts for an observer on Earth and find that the turbulence amplitude must be within $0.5-20\,$nG for a coherence length of $10\,$kpc. At the same time, the burst-rate density must be above $50\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ for Local-Sheet galaxies to reproduce the UHECR excesses and below $5\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ ($30\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$) for the Milky Way (Local-Group galaxies) not to outshine other galaxies. For the transient emissions of protons and nuclei to match the energy spectra of UHECRs, the kinetic energy of the outflows responsible for UHECR acceleration must be below $4\times10^{54}\,$erg and above $5\times10^{50}\,$erg ($2\times10^{49}\,$erg) if we consider the Milky Way (or not). The only stellar-sized transients that satisfy both Hillas' and our criteria are long gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pseudo-Dirac neutrinos from Astrophysical sources in IceCube data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze IceCube public data from its IC86 configuration, namely PSTracks event selection, to search for pseudo-Dirac signatures in high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. Neutrino flux from astrophysical sources is reduced in the pseudo-Dirac scenario due to conversion of active-to-sterile neutrinos as compared to the neutrino oscillation scenario of only three active neutrinos over astrophysical distances. We fit IceCube data using astrophysical flux models for three point-like sources in both scenarios and constrain the active-sterile mass-square-difference in the absence of any evidence for pseudo-Dirac scenario. We find that a common mass-squared-difference $\delta m^2$ for all three flavors can be constrained as $\delta m^2 \lesssim 2.2 \times 10^{-19} eV^2$ for the source NGC 1068, $\delta m^2 \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-20} eV^2$ for the source TXS 0506+056, and $\delta m^2 \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-21} eV^2$ for the source PKS 1424+240 at 90% C.L. A stacking analysis gives a constraint on $\delta m^2 \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-21} eV^2$ at 90% CL which is dominated by the constraint obtained from PKS 1424+240.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Spacetime With Multipole Moments: The Minimal Size Conjecture, Black Hole Shadow, and Gravitational Wave Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explicitly construct the vacuum solution of Einstein's equations with prescribed multipole moments. By observing the behavior of the multipole spacetime metric at small distances, we conjecture that for a sufficiently large multipole moment, there is a minimal size below which no object in nature can support such a moment. The examples we have investigated suggest that such minimal size scales as $(M_n)^{1/(n+1)}$ (instead of $(M_n/M)^{1/n}$), where $M$ is the mass and $M_n$ is the $n$th order multipole moment. With the metric of the "multipole spacetime", we analyze the shape of black hole shadow for various multipole moments and discuss the prospects of constraining the moments from shadow observations. In addition, we discuss the shift of gravitational wave phase with respect to those of the Kerr spacetime, for a test particle moving around an object with this set of multipole moments. These phase shifts are required for the program of mapping out the spacetime multipole moments based on gravitational wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical and relativistic modeling of the recoiling black-hole candidate in quasar 3C 186</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The compact object in quasar 3C 186 is one of the most promising recoiling black-hole candidates, exhibiting both an astrometric displacement between the quasar and the host galaxy as well as a spectroscopic shift between broad and narrow lines. 3C 186 also presents a radio jet which, when projected onto the plane of the sky, appears to be perpendicular to the quasar/galaxy displacement. Assuming a gravitational-wave kick is indeed responsible for the properties of 3C 186 and using state-of-the-art relativistic modeling, we show that current observations allow for exquisite modeling of the recoiling black hole. Most notably, we find that the kick velocity, the black-hole spin, and the line of sight are almost collinear and the former appear perpendicular to each other only because of a strong projection effect. The targeted configuration requires substantial fine-tuning: while there exists a region in the black-hole binary parameter space that is compatible with 3C 186, the observed system appears to be a rare occurrence. Using archival radio observations, we explore different strategies that could potentially confirm or rule out our interpretation. In particular, we develop two observational tests that rely on the brightness ratio between the approaching and receding jet as well as the asymmetry of the jet lobes. While the available radio data provide loose constraints, deeper observations have the unique potential of unveiling the nature of 3C 186.</description>

Abstract: We have performed numerical calculations of a binary interacting with a gas disk, using eleven different numerical methods and a standard binary-disk setup. The goal of this study is to determine whether all codes agree on a numerically converged solution, and to determine the necessary resolution for convergence and the number of binary orbits that must be computed to reach an agreed-upon relaxed state of the binary-disk system. We find that all codes can agree on a converged solution (depending on the diagnostic being measured). The zone spacing required for most codes to reach a converged measurement of the torques applied to the binary by the disk is roughly 1% of the binary separation in the vicinity of the binary components. For our disk model to reach a relaxed state, codes must be run for at least 200 binary orbits, corresponding to about a viscous time for our parameters, $0.2 (a^2 \Omega_B /\nu)$ binary orbits, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. We did not investigate dependence on binary mass ratio, eccentricity, disk temperature, or disk viscosity; therefore, these benchmarks may act as guides towards expanding converged solutions to the wider parameter space but might need to be updated in a future study that investigates dependence on system parameters. We find the most major discrepancies between codes resulted from the dimensionality of the setup (3D vs 2D disks). Beyond this, we find good agreement in the total torque on the binary between codes, although the partition of this torque between the gravitational torque, orbital accretion torque, and spin accretion torque depends sensitively on the sink prescriptions employed. In agreement with previous studies, we find a modest difference in torques and accretion variability between 2D and 3D disk models. We find cavity precession rates to be appreciably faster in 3D than in 2D.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>

Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a parsimonious manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the [textgreek]&lt;LaTeX&gt;\textgreek{g}&lt;/LaTeX&gt; Eddington parameter, which reads {\gamma}_{exact}=(({\omega}+1+({\omega}+2){\Theta})/({\omega}+2+({\omega}+1){\Theta})), where {\Theta} is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This non-perturbative result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian (({\omega}+1)/({\omega}+2)) expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value ({\gamma}_{GR}=1) as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case {\Theta} approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. {\omega}&gt;-3/2, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution, hence requiring two quantities (energy and pressure integrals) of the mass source to fully characterize the solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10070</link>

Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>
