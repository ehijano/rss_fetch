      <title>A Detailed Exploration of Bouncing Solutions using Reconstruction Schemes in Curvature Matter Coupled Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is devoted to explore some interesting cosmological features of a newly proposed theory of gravity namely $\mathcal{F}(R,L_m,T)$ theory, where $R$ and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar and trace of energy momentum-tensor, respectively. Firstly, a non-equilibrium thermodynamical description is considered on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann's cosmos. The Friedmann equations are demonstrated to be equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, i.e., ${T_{Ah}d\varepsilon_{h}^\prime+T_{Ah}d_{i}\varepsilon_{h}^\prime=-d\hat{E}+\hat{W}dV}$, where ${d_{i}\varepsilon_{h}^\prime}$ refers to entropy production term. We also formulate the constraint for validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics and check it for some simple well-known forms of generic function $\mathcal{F}(R,L_m,T)$. Next, we develop the energy bounds for this framework and constraint the free variables by finding the validity regions for NEC and WEC. Further, we reconstruct some interesting cosmological solutions namely power law, $\Lambda$CDM and de Sitter models in this theory. The reconstructed solutions are then examined by checking the validity of GSLT and energy bounds. Lastly, we analyze the stability of all reconstructed solutions by introducing suitable perturbations in the field equations. It is concluded that obtained solutions are stable and cosmologically viable.</description>

      <title>A new semi-coherent targeted search for continuous gravitational waves from pulsars in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel semi-coherent targeted search method for continuous gravitational waves (CW) emitted by pulsars in binary systems. The method is based on a custom optimization of the coherence time according to the orbital parameters and their uncertainties, as provided by electromagnetic observations. While rotating pulsars are expected to produce quasi-monochromatic CWs in their reference frame, their orbital motion introduces an additional modulation in the observer frame, alongside the one due to the Earth's motion. As a result, the received signal is dispersed across a frequency range and corrections, aimed at removing the orbital modulation, are therefore required to achieve detection. However, Doppler corrections can, in some cases, significantly vary within the uncertainties with which orbital parameters are known. In order to optimally exploit the constraints drawn from electromagnetic observations we implement a semi-coherent search, more robust than fully coherent methods, in which the coherence time is evaluated for each source taking into account uncertainties in its orbital parameters. This method was tested and applied to a set of twelve targets from the ATNF catalogue. The search identified a single outlier which astrophysical origin has been confidently excluded. For the first time to our knowledge, we then set upper limits on the signal strain from these 12 pulsars, the lowest being $h_{UL}\sim1.06\cdot10^{-25}$ for PSR J1326-4728B.</description>

      <title>Strong Cosmic Censorship in Kerr-Newman-de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Christodoulou's formulation of Strong Cosmic Censorship (SCC) holds true for Kerr-de Sitter black holes. On the other hand, Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black holes violate SCC. We do a detailed scan of the parameter space of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes between these two limiting families, to identify the boundary that marks the transition between solutions that respect and violate SCC. We focus our attention on linear scalar field perturbations. SCC is violated inside a (roughly) `spherical' shell of the parameter space of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter, centred at the corner that describes arbitrarily small extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solutions. Outside of this region, including the Kerr-de Sitter limit, we identify perturbation modes that decay slow enough to enforce SCC. Additionally, we do a necessary study of the quasinormal mode spectra of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter in some detail. As established in the literature, in the Kerr-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter limits, we find three families of modes: de Sitter, photon sphere and near-horizon modes. These interact non-trivially away from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter limit and display eigenvalue repulsions like in Kerr-Newman black holes.</description>

      <title>Super-extremal black holes in the quasitopological electromagnetic field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that a simple generalization of electromagnetism, referred to as quasitopological electromagnetic field theory, is characterized by the presence of dyonic black-hole solutions of the Einstein field equations that, in certain parameter regions, are characterized by four horizons. In the present compact paper we reveal the existence, in this non-linear electrodynamic field theory, of super-extremal black-hole spacetimes that are characterized by the four degenerate functional relations $[g_{00}(r)]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[dg_{00}(r)/dr]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^2g_{00}(r)/dr^2]_ {r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^3g_{00}(r)/dr^3]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=0$, where $g_{00}(r)$ is the $tt$-component of the curved line element and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the black-hole horizon radius. In particular, using analytical techniques we prove that the quartically degenerate super-extremal black holes are characterized by the universal (parameter-{\it independent}) dimensionless compactness parameter $M/r_{\text{H}}={2\over3}(2\gamma+1)$, where $\gamma\equiv{_2F_1}(1/4,1;5/4;-3)$.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves in non-singular matter bouncing cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel model-independent generic mechanism for primordial black hole formation within the context of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology. In particular, considering a short duration transition from the matter contracting phase to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, we find naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales which can collapse and form primordial black holes. Interestingly, the primordial black hole masses that we find can lie within the observationally unconstrained asteroid-mass window, potentially explaining the totality of dark matter. Remarkably, the enhanced curvature perturbations, collapsing to primordial black holes, can induce as well a stochastic gravitational-wave background, being potentially detectable by future experiments, in particular by SKA, PTAs, LISA and ET, hence serving as a new portal to probe the potential bouncing nature of the initial conditions prevailing in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild argued that measurements of timelike and null geodesics yield projective and Weyl connections, respectively, with compatibility giving an integrable Weyl geometry. We find greater freedom for both connections, including either a 1-parameter class of projective connections, or a conformal connection for timelike curves, and conformal symmetry for null curves. Examining the effect of every member of both the projective class and the conformal transformations on the curvature, torsion, nonmetricity, and metric, we find the changes from the original geometry. Forming invariant connections we compute both the projectively and conformally invariant forms of the curvature, torsion, and nometricity, showing that the projective and conformal tensors depend on the same gauge vector. We prove that the conditions for projective and conformal Ricci flatness imply each other and either reduces the geometry to the original form. The different transformations depend on the same monotonic, twice differentiable function on a region of spacetime. Existence of such a function requires a region foliated by order isomorphic, totally ordered, twice differentiable timelike curves in a necessarily Lorentzian geometry. To find a geometry consistent with the allowed symmetry, we develop the real, linear, 6-dim representation of the conformal connection. Taking the simplest form of the spacetime action using this connection, we show that reductions of the system lead us back to an integrable Weyl geometry.</description>

      <title>Relativistic generalised uncertainty and the corrected vacuum energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we make use of the recent covariant extension of the generalised uncertainty principle to study the corrections to the vacuum energy of the simplest scalar quantum field theory. We then calculate the modifications to the Casimir effect that such a correction to the vacuum energy would bring about. We emphasise that these corrections are indeed physical.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-spectral approach to constructing rotating boson star spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel numerical solver for the systems of coupled non-linear elliptical differential equations. The solver partitions the computational domain into a set of rectangular pseudo-spectral collocation subdomains and is especially well-suited for working with stiff solutions such as almost shell-like solitonic boson stars. The method can be used in any number of dimensions although is practical for one- to three-dimensional problems. We apply the method to rotating and spherically symmetric solitonic boson stars and demonstrate that it displays exponential convergence. In the spherical symmetric case we explore families of almost shell-like solitonic boson stars and get the results that conform with the well-known analytic approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitonic boson stars (SBS) are compact shell-like objects with an inside having a nearly constant value of scalar field bounded by a thin shell where the scalar field rapidly changes. While the spherically symmetric SBS can be described by an analytical approximation that works well in the thin-shell case, no such approximation exists for rotating SBS and the investigation of such stars poses a numerical challenge. We numerically investigate rotating SBS in case if the relative thickness of the shell is small. We compute Gerosh-Hansen multipole moments to study the structure of SBS spacetime in the outside region and the closeness of SBS to the rotating black hole metric.</description>

      <title>Graviton mass due to dark energy as a superconducting medium: theoretical and phenomenological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equations can be interpreted as a stress tensor for dark energy. This stress tensor is formally analogous to an elastic constitutive equation in continuum mechanics. As a result, the cosmological constant leads to a "shear modulus" and "bulk modulus" affecting all gravitational fields in the universe. The form of the constitutive equation is also analogous to the London constitutive equation for a superconductor. Treating dark energy as a type of superconducting medium for gravitational waves leads to a Yukawa-like gravitational potential and a massive graviton within standard General Relativity. We discuss a number of resulting phenomenological aspects such as a screening length scale that can also be used to describe the effects generally attributed to dark matter. In addition, we find a gravitational wave plasma frequency, index of refraction, and impedance. The expansion of the universe is interpreted as a Meissner-like effect as dark energy causes an outward "expulsion" of space-time similar to a superconductor expelling a magnetic field. The fundamental cause of these effects is interpreted as a type of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a scalar field. There is an associated chemical potential, critical temperature, and an Unruh-Hawking effect associated with the formulation.</description>

      <title>A bonafide model of structure formation from gravitational collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the cosmological implications of a scalar field with a specific potential, crucial for achieving the final equilibrium state of gravitational collapse. We consider a system with two fluids: minimally coupled matter representing dust-like dark matter and a scalar field acting as dark energy. Our model, akin to the top-hat collapse model, focuses on isolated over-dense regions within a closed FLRW metric, while the background follows a flat FLRW metric. We analyze spacetime configurations where these regions undergo initial expansion followed by contraction, deriving the scalar field potential responsible for their equilibrium state. Our fully relativistic approach offers a comprehensive understanding of stable cosmic over-dense regions, without the need for ad-hoc Newtonian virialization.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating as a discriminator for horizons in equatorial eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal heating in a binary black hole system is driven by the absorption of energy and angular momentum by the black hole's horizon. Previous works have shown that this phenomenon becomes particularly significant during the late stages of an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) into a rapidly spinning massive black hole, a key focus for future low-frequency gravitational-wave observations by (for instance) the LISA mission. Past analyses have largely focused on quasi-circular inspiral geometry, with some of the most detailed studies looking at equatorial cases. Though useful for illustrating the physical principles, this limit is not very realistic astrophysically, since the population of EMRI events is expected to arise from compact objects scattered onto relativistic orbits in galactic centers through many-body events. In this work, we extend those results by studying the importance of tidal heating in equatorial EMRIs with generic eccentricities. Our results suggest that accurate modeling of tidal heating is crucial to prevent significant dephasing and systematic errors in EMRI parameter estimation. We examine a phenomenological model for EMRIs around exotic compact objects by parameterizing deviations from the black hole picture in terms of the fraction of radiation absorbed compared to the BH case. Based on a mismatch calculation we find that reflectivities as small as $|\mathcal{R}|^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ are distinguishable from the BH case, irrespective of the value of the eccentricity. We stress, however, that this finding should be corroborated by future parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Black Hole Parameters on Photon Sphere and Shadow Radius: New Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a novel approach to investigate the behavior of the photon sphere and shadow radius. Our method leverages extended gravitational decoupling and unveils two key analytic results. First, the additional matter field alters the photon sphere radius: it increases if $g'(r_{ph}^{(0)})&gt;0$ and decreases if $g'(r_{ph}^{(0)})&lt;0$ (where $g'$ represents the derivative of a specific metric function evaluated at the original photon sphere radius). Second, the presence of the matter field can modify the black hole shadow size. If $g\left(r_{ph}^{(0)}\right)&gt;0$, the shadow shrinks, while it grows for $g\left(r_{ph}^{(0)}\right)&lt;0$. These findings offer a deeper understanding of how matter distribution affects the characteristics of black holes and their observable features. By providing a systematic framework supported by diverse illustrative examples, our investigation not only sheds light on these fundamental aspects but also quantifiably advances the theoretical framework in black hole astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by a Lorentz-violating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational lensing by a Lorentz-violating (LV) black hole inspired by the recent contribution [1]. Explicitly, we concentrate on a specific application: we perform the computation of gravitational lensing effects under the strong field limit. In particular, we analytically derive the deflection angle so that the lens equation can also be addressed. This methodological approach yields physically measurable outcomes, including the determination of relativistic image positions and their corresponding magnifications. As an application of this methodology, we consider the gravitational lensing by Sagittarius A${}^*$ and obtain the corresponding observables expressed as functions of the LV parameter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse in effective loop quantum gravity: beyond marginally bound configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational collapse in effective loop quantum gravity, focusing on non-marginally bound configurations in Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes. In the homogeneous limit we recover the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology for Friedman cosmologies with spatial curvature. We study a particular family of configurations with a homogeneous interior and a sharp boundary where the dust energy density rapidly and continuously decreases to zero. For these configurations, the gravitational collapse continues to the Planck regime when a bounce occurs, at which point the dust ball starts to expand, and a shock wave forms in the gravitational field within the order of a Planck time after the bounce. The shock slowly moves outwards, eventually reaching the horizon which then disappears, at which time there is no longer a black hole. If the initial configuration is bound, the shock asymptotes to a maximal radius, whereas for unbound initial configurations the shock escapes to infinity. In all cases, the black hole lifetime is proportional to the square of the black hole mass, and additionally depends on how strongly bound the dust profile is; this last quantity also affects the vacuum region outside the dust profile which is not solely determined by the black hole mass and charge as in spherically symmetric general relativity. We also use numerics to study a wide range of other types of initial configurations, both bound and unbound, with qualitatively similar results.</description>

Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate anthropic prediction of dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Accretion-Driven Starquakes in Recycled Millisecond Pulsars using Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recycled millisecond pulsars are susceptible to starquakes as they are continuously accreting matter from their binary companion. A starquake happens when the rotational frequency of the star crosses its breaking frequency. In this study, we perform a model analysis of an accreting neutron star suffering a starquake. We analyze two models: a spherical star with accreting mountains and a deformed star with accreting mountains. We find that as the star crosses the breaking frequency and suffers a starquake there is a sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal arriving from them. It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave signals increases suddenly for the spherical star. In contrast, for the deformed star, the amplitude of the continuous gravitational wave signal decreases suddenly. This sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal in recycled millisecond pulsars can be a unique signature for such pulsars undergoing a starquake.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole from noncommutative charged scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of noncommutative (NC) deformation of gauge field theory by twist, we first rederive the NC scalar and gauge field model from our previous papers and then generalize it to the second order in the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map. It turns out that SW expansion is finite and that it ceases at the second order in the deformation parameter, ultimately giving rise to the equation of motion for the scalar field that is nonperturbative and exact at the same order. As a further step, we show that the effective metric put forth and constructed in our previous work satisfies the equations of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, but only within the first order of deformation and when the gauge field is fixed by the Coulomb potential of the charged black hole. Thus obtained NC deformation of the Reissner--Nordstr\"om (RN) metric appears to have an additional off-diagonal element which scales linearly with a deformation parameter. We analyze various properties of this metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between the phase transition and Lyapunov exponents for 4D Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. We consider the motion of massless and massive particles around an unstable circular orbit of the Hayward AdS black hole in the equatorial plane and calculate the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. The phase transition is found to be well described by the multivaled Lyapunov exponents. It is also found that different phases of Hayward AdS black hole coincide with different branches of the Lyapunov exponents. We also study the discontinuous change in the Lyapunov exponents and find that it can serve as an order parameter near the critical point. The critical exponent of change in Lyapunov exponent near the critical point is found to be $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Maximal mass of the neutron star with a deconfined quark core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of equation of state for the matter in the neutron star plays an important role in determining its maximal mass. In addition, it must comply with the condition of causality. Noting that the central density of a maximally massive neutron star is well above the nuclear saturation density, a deconfined quark core in the central region is motivated in this paper. We analyze this scenario by employing the MIT bag model to represent the core region and one of the unified equations of state for the region outside the core. Such combination is found to solve the problem of causality violation. In each case of the combined equations of state, the radial profile of $\rho r^2$ displays a peak and dominant contribution to the total mass of the star comes from the region around the peak value of $\rho r^2$, whereas the contribution is small from the regions near the center and the surface. This peak occurs in the region of hadronic matter for the combinations considered in this paper. Importantly, we find that the position of the peak in $\rho r^2$ is well-correlated with the maximal mass -- the highest value of $1.98\ M_\odot$ obtains for the case with the peak occurring farthest from the center. This gravitational threshold being obtained for a non-rotating neutron star, we expect the threshold to lie well above 2 $ M_\odot$ for a rapidly rotating neutron star, that may explain the existance of massive pulsars from recent astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Rastall Gravity: from low-mass HESS J1731-347 to high-mass PSR J0952-0607 pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to Rastall gravity we introduce matter-geometry nonminimal coupling which is proportional to the gradient of quadratic curvature invariants. Those are mimicking the conformal trace anomaly when backreaction of the quantum fields to a curved spacetime geometry is considered. We consider a static spherically symmetric stellar structure with anisotropic fluid and Krori-Barua metric potentials model to examine the theory. Confronting the model with NICER+XMM-Newton observational constraints on the pulsar PSR J0740$+$6620 quantifies the amount of the nonminimal coupling via a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon\simeq -0.01$. We verify that the conformal symmetry is broken everywhere inside the pulsar as the trace anomaly $\Delta&gt;0$, or equivalently the trace of the stress-energy tensor $\mathfrak{T}&lt;0$, whereas the adiabatic sound speed does not violate the conjecture conformal upper limit $v_r^2/c^2 = 1/3$. The maximum compactness accordingly is $C_\text{max}=0.752$ which is $4\%$ higher than GR. Notably, if the conformal sound speed constraint is hold, observational data excludes $\epsilon \geq 0$ up to $\geq 1.6\sigma$. The stellar model is consistent with the self-bound structure with soft linear equation of state. Investigating possible connection with MIT bag model of strange quarks sets physical bounds from microscopic physics which confirm the negative value of the parameter $\epsilon$. We estimate a radius $R=13.21 \pm 0.96$ km of the most massive observed compact star PSR J0952$-$0607 with $M=2.35\pm0.17 M_\odot$. Finally, we show that the corresponding mass-radius diagram fits well lowest-mass pulsar HESS J1731$-$347 and highest-mass pulsar PSR J0952$-$0607 ever observed as well as the intermediate mass range as obtained by NICER and LIGO/Virgo observations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ Compact Object and a Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a coalescing compact binary with component masses $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0~M_\odot$ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network on 2023 May 29 by the LIGO Livingston Observatory. The primary component of the source has a mass less than $5~M_\odot$ at 99% credibility. We cannot definitively determine from gravitational-wave data alone whether either component of the source is a neutron star or a black hole. However, given existing estimates of the maximum neutron star mass, we find the most probable interpretation of the source to be the coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole that has a mass between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes observed in the Galaxy. We estimate a merger rate density of $55^{+127}_{-47}~\text{Gpc}^{-3}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to the source of GW230529_181500; assuming that the source is a neutron star-black hole merger, GW230529_181500-like sources constitute about 60% of the total merger rate inferred for neutron star-black hole coalescences. The discovery of this system implies an increase in the expected rate of neutron star-black hole mergers with electromagnetic counterparts and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the purported lower mass gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the distribution formalism to derive the complete set of junction conditions for general Local Rotationally Symmetric (LRS) spacetimes in the $1+1+2$ covariant formalism. We start by developing a parametric framework encompassing timelike, spacelike, or null hypersurfaces. We then introduce the distribution formalism in the $1+1+2$ framework and obtain the necessary conditions to preserve the regularity of the $1+1+2$ equations at the separation hypersurface. Using these results, we can deduce some general prescriptions on the junction of LRS spacetimes and the properties of the shell in the non-smooth cases. As examples of the application of the junction conditions, we use this formalism to perform the matching necessary to obtain well-known solutions, e.g., the Martinez thin-shell, the Schwarzschild constant-density fluid star, and the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse.</description>

Abstract: In the presence of the gravitational field, the energy density of matter no longer coincides with its mass density. A discrepancy exists, of course, also between the associated power spectra. Within the $\Lambda$CDM model, we derive a formula that relates the power spectrum of the energy density to that of the mass density and test it with the help of N-body simulations run in comoving boxes of 2.816 Gpc/$h$. The results confirm the validity of the derived formula and simultaneously show that the power spectra diverge significantly from one another at large cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Inferring properties of dark galactic halos using strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be deflected, similarly to electromagnetic (EM) waves, by massive objects through the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. The importance of gravitational lensing for GW astronomy is becoming increasingly apparent in the GW detection era, in which nearly 100 events have already been detected. As current ground-based interferometers reach their design sensitivities, it is anticipated that these detectors may observe a few GW signals that are strongly lensed by the dark halos of intervening galaxies or galaxy clusters. Analysing strong lensing effects on GW signals is, thus, becoming important to understand the lens' properties and correctly infer the intrinsic GW source parameters. However, one cannot accurately infer lens parameters for complex lens models with only GW observations because there are strong degeneracies between the parameters of lensed waveforms. In this paper, we discuss how to conduct parameter estimation of strongly lensed GW signals and infer the lens parameters using additional EM information, including the lens galaxy's axis ratio and the GW source-hosting galaxy's lensed images. We find that for simple spherically symmetric lens models, the lens parameters can be well recovered using only GW information. On the other hand, recovering the lens parameters requires systems in which four or more GW images are detected with additional EM observations for non-axially symmetric lens models. Combinations of GW and EM observations can further improve the inference of the lens parameters.</description>

      <title>A covariant tapestry of linear GUP, metric-affine gravity, their Poincar\'e algebra and entropy bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the potential connection between metric-affine gravity and linear Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) in the phase space, we develop a covariant form of linear GUP and an associated modified Poincar\'e algebra, which exhibits distinctive behavior, nearing nullity at the minimal length scale proposed by linear GUP. We use 3-torus geometry to visually represent linear GUP within a covariant framework. The 3-torus area provides an exact geometric representation of Bekenstein's universal bound. We depart from Bousso's approach, which adapts Bekenstein's bound by substituting the Schwarzschild radius ($r_s$) with the radius ($R$) of the smallest sphere enclosing the physical system, thereby basing the covariant entropy bound on the sphere's area. Instead, our revised covariant entropy bound is described by the area of a 3-torus, determined by both the inner radius $r_s$ and outer radius $R$ where $r_s\leq R $ due to gravitational stability. This approach results in a more precise geometric representation of Bekenstein's bound, notably for larger systems where Bousso's bound is typically much larger than Bekensetin's universal bound. Furthermore, we derive an equation that turns the standard uncertainty inequality into an equation when considering the contribution of the 3-torus covariant entropy bound, suggesting a new avenue of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct models of two exotic objects: (i) a wormhole whose throat is hidden by a stellar object like a neutron star; and (ii) a wormhole inside a black hole. We work within Einstein's gravity coupled to two scalar fields with a specific choice of the scalar field Lagrangian. In general, the model contains ghosts, but they are eliminated using the constraints given by the Lagrange multiplier fields. The constraints are a generalization of the mimetic constraint, where non-dynamical dark matter effectively appears. As a result, in our model, instead of the non-dynamical dark matter, non-dynamical exotic matter like a phantom effectively arises. For the mixed wormhole-plus-star system, we find the corresponding mass-radius relations and show that it is possible to get characteristics comparable to those of ordinary neutron stars. For the wormhole inside the black hole, we find an extremal limit where the radius of the throat coincides with the radius of the event horizon and demonstrate that the Hawking temperature vanishes in this limit.</description>

We derive the equations of motion for photons in the Kerr-Newman spacetime. We obtain explicit expressions for redshift/blueshift photons emitted by an object orbiting a Kerr-Newman black hole. Finally, using the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we express the red/blue shifts in terms of the metric parameters.</description>

      <title>Uncovering faint lensed gravitational-wave signals and reprioritizing their follow-up analysis using galaxy lensing forecasts with detected counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like light, gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive astrophysical objects. For galaxy and galaxy-cluster lenses, one expects to see strong lensing -- forecasted to become observable in the coming years -- where the original wave is split into multiple copies with the same frequency evolution but different overall arrival times, phases, amplitudes, and signal strengths. Some of these images can be below the detection threshold and require targeted search methods, based on tailor-made template banks. These searches can be made more sensitive by using our knowledge of the typical distribution and morphology of lenses to predict the time delay, magnification, and image-type ordering of the lensed images. Here, we show that when a subset of the images is super-threshold, they can be used to construct a more constrained prediction of the arrival time of the remaining signals, enhancing our ability to identify lensing candidate signals. Our suggested method effectively reduces the list of triggers requiring follow-up and generally re-ranks the genuine counterpart higher in the lensing candidate list. Therefore, in the future, if one observes two or three lensed images, the information they provide can be used to identify their sub-threshold counterparts, thus allowing identification of additional lensed images. Finding such images would also strengthen our evidence for the event being lensed.</description>

Abstract: The most general set of static and spherically symmetric solutions for conformal Killing gravity coupled to Maxwell fields is presented in closed form. These solutions, depending on six parameters, include non-asymptotically flat black holes or naked singularities, non-asymptotically flat traversable wormholes, and (possibly singularity-free) closed universes. We also consider the inverse problem, showing that the most general energy-momentum tensor generating a given static spherically symmetric metric depends on three parameters. Sourceless time-dependent isotropic solutions are also given. These solutions depending on the curvature, the cosmological constant, and a new integration constant $\alpha$, present a rich variety, including singularity-free eternal cosmologies and universes evolving symmetrically from a big bang to a big crunch within a finite lapse of time.</description>

      <title>AdS/CFT Correspondence in Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence1-3, also known as the gravity/gauge duality, posits a dual relationship between the quantum gravity in an AdS spacetime and the CFT defined on its lower-dimensional boundary. This correspondence not only offers profound insights into the enigmatic nature of quantum gravity but also shows mighty power in addressing strongly-correlated systems. However, despite its importance in contemporary physics, the AdS/CFT correspondence remains a conjecture, and further experimental investigation is highly sought after. Here, we present the first experimental exploration of this conjecture by testing its core corollary: the leading-order effects of a strongly-coupled CFT can be exactly described by a weakly-coupled classical field in a higher-dimensional AdS spacetime. Through measuring the bulk entanglement entropy (BEE) and boundary-boundary correlation function (BBCF) of scalar fields in both conventional type-I and previously overlooked type-II hyperbolic lattices, serving as the discretized regularizations of spatial geometries of pure AdS2+1 spacetime and AdS2+1 black hole, respectively, we experimentally confirm that BEE exhibits a logarithmic scaling with the subsystem size, following the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula, while BBCF showcases an exponential law dependence on the boundary separation, the scaling dimension of which conforms to the Klebanov-Witten (KW) relation, both of which align remarkably well with the established CFT outcomes. This heuristic experimental effort opens a new avenue for in-depth investigations on the gravity/gauge duality and extensive exploration of quantum-gravity-inspired phenomena in classical systems.</description>

      <title>Late-time Cosmology without Dark Sector but with Closed String Massless Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to solve the dark energy and the coincidence problems by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that these observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector and coincidence problem. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Yang-Mills wormholes haunted by a phantom field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study wormhole spacetimes in the framework of the static spherically symmetric SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a phantom scalar field. We show rigorously the existence of an infinite sequence of symmetric wormhole solutions, labelled by the number of zeros of the Yang-Mills potential. These solutions have previously been discovered numerically. Mathematically, the problem resembles the pure Einstein-Yang-Mills system for black hole initial conditions, which was well-studied in the 90s. The main difference in the present work is that the coupling to the phantom field adds a non-trivial degree of complexity to the analysis. After proving the existence of the symmetric wormhole solutions, we also present numerical evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Attractive (s)axions: cosmological trackers at the boundary of moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a FLRW universe dominated by the energy density of moduli close to asymptotic regions of moduli space. Due to the structure of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA kinetic term, a saxion and an axion residing in the same chiral multiplet are (universally) coupled even if the latter is a flat direction of the potential, resulting in non-trivial dynamics. We generalise known results in the literature to the case of multiple moduli, showing the existence of various ``tracker" attractor solutions where the relative energy densities of many components (axions included) stay in a fixed ratio throughout the evolution. We conclude with some phenomenological applications, relevant for both the early and late universe.</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <title>Comments Concerning a Hypothetical Mesoscopic Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>
