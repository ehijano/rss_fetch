      <title>A finitary Kronecker's lemma and large deviations in the Strong Law of Large numbers on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the computational content of Kronecker's lemma via the proof-theoretic perspective of proof mining and utilise the resulting finitary variant of this fundamental result to provide new rates for the Strong Law of Large Numbers for random variables taking values in type $p$ Banach spaces, which in particular are very uniform in the sense that they do not depend on the distribution of the random variables. Furthermore, we provide computability-theoretic arguments to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Kronecker's lemma and investigate the result from the perspective of Reverse Mathematics. In addition, we demonstrate how this ineffectiveness from Kronecker's lemma trickles down to the Strong Law of Large Numbers by providing a construction that shows that computable rates of convergence are not always possible. Lastly, we demonstrate how Kronecker's lemma falls under a class of deterministic formulas whose solution to their Dialectica interpretation satisfies a continuity property and how, for such formulas, one obtains an upgrade principle that allows one to lift computational interpretations of deterministic results to quantitative results for their probabilistic analogue. This result generalises the previous work of the author and Pischke.</description>

      <title>Conditional reasoning and the shadows it casts onto the first-order logic: the Nelsonian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a natural notion of standard translation for the formulas of conditional logic which is analogous to the standard translation of modal formulas into the first-order logic. We briefly show that this translation works (modulo a lightweight first-order encoding of the conditional models) for the minimal classical conditional logic $\mathsf{CK}$ introduced by Brian Chellas; however, the main result of the paper is that a classically equivalent reformulation of these notions (i.e. of standard translation plus theory of conditional models) also faithfully embeds the basic Nelsonian conditional logic $\mathsf{N4CK}$, introduced in arXiv:2311.02361 into $\mathsf{QN4}$, the paraconsistent variant of Nelson's first-order logic of strong negation. Thus $\mathsf{N4CK}$ is the logic induced by the Nelsonian reading of the classical Chellas semantics of conditionals and can, therefore, be considered a faithful analogue of $\mathsf{CK}$ on the non-classical basis provided by the propositional fragment of $\mathsf{QN4}$. Moreover, the methods used to prove our main result can be easily adapted to the case of modal logic, which allows to improve an older result by S. Odintsov and H. Wansing about the standard translation embedding of the Nelsonian modal logic $\mathsf{FSK}^d$ into $\mathsf{QN4}$.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Finite Borel Asymptotic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the set of locally finite Borel graphs with finite Borel asymptotic dimension is $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$-complete. The result is based on a combinatorial characterization of finite Borel asymptotic dimension for graphs generated by a single Borel function. As an application of this characterization, we classify the complexities of digraph homomorphism problems for this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Abstract Corrected Iterations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $(&lt;\lambda)$-support iterations of a version of $(&lt;\lambda)$-strategically complete $\lambda^+$-c.c. definable forcing notions along partial orders. We show that such iterations can be corrected to yield an analog of a result by Judah and Shelah for finite support iterations of Suslin ccc forcing, namely that if $(\mathbb{P}_{\alpha}, \underset{\sim}{\mathbb Q_{\beta}} : \alpha \leq \delta, \beta &lt;\delta)$ is a FS iteration of Suslin ccc forcing and $U\subseteq \delta$ is sufficiently closed, then letting $\mathbb{P}_U$ be the iteration along $U$, we have $\mathbb{P}_U \lessdot \mathbb{P}_{\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Colimits of Heyting Algebras through Esakia Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we generalize the construction, due to Ghilardi, of the free Heyting algebra generated by a finite distributive lattice, to the case of arbitrary distributive lattices. Categorically, this provides an explicit construction of a left adjoint to the inclusion of Heyting algebras in the category of distributive lattices This is shown to have several applications, both old and new, in the study of Heyting algebras: (1) it allows a more concrete description of colimits of Heyting algebras, as well as, via duality theory, limits of Esakia spaces, by knowing their description over distributive lattices and Priestley spaces; (2) It allows a direct proof of the amalgamation property for Heyting algebras, and of related facts; (3) it allows a proof of the fact that the category of Heyting algebras is co-distributive. We also study some generalizations and variations of this construction to different settings. First, we analyse some subvarieties of Heyting algebras -- such as Boolean algebras, $\mathsf{KC}$ and $\mathsf{LC}$ algebras, and show how the construction can be adapted to this setting. Second, we study the relationship between the category of image-finite posets with p-morphisms and the category of posets with monotone maps, showing that a variation of the above ideas provides us with an appropriate general idea.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise the model-theoretic algebraic closure in Zilber's exponential field. A key step involves showing that certain algebraic varieties have finite intersections with certain finite-rank subgroups of the graph of exponentiation. Mordell-Lang for algebraic tori (a theorem of Laurent) plays a central role in our proof.</description>

      <title>Borel graphable equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of analytic equivalence relations which are Borel graphable, i.e. which can be realized as the connectedness relation of a Borel graph. Our main focus is the question of which analytic equivalence relations are Borel graphable. First, we study an equivalence relation arising from the theory of countable admissible ordinals and show that it is Borel graphable if and only if there is a non-constructible real. As a corollary of the proof, we construct an analytic equivalence relation which is (provably in ZFC) not Borel graphable and an effectively analytic equivalence relation which is Borel graphable but not effectively Borel graphable. Next, we study analytic equivalence relations given by the isomorphism relation for some class of countable structures. We show that all such equivalence relations are Borel graphable, which implies that for every Borel action of $S_\infty$, the associated orbit equivalence relation is Borel graphable. This leads us to study the class of Polish groups whose Borel actions always give rise to Borel graphable orbit equivalence relations; we refer to such groups as graphic groups. We show that besides $S_\infty$, the class of graphic groups includes all connected Polish groups and is closed under countable products. We finish by studying structural properties of the class of Borel graphable analytic equivalence relations and by considering two variations on Borel graphability: a generalization with hypegraphs instead of graphs and an analogue of Borel graphability in the setting of computably enumerable equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Smullyan's truth and provability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Smullyan's paper ``Truth and Provability'' for three purposes. First, we introduce the notion of Smullyan models to give a precise definition for Smullyan's framework discussed in that paper. Second, we clarify the relationship between Theorems F, T, and G proved by Smullyan and other newly introduced properties for Smullyan models in terms of both implications and non-implications. Third, we construct two Smullyan models based on arithmetic and show the correspondence between the properties of these Smullyan models and those concerning truth and provability in arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Intuitionistic logic, dual intuitionistic logic, and modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore various semantic understandings of dual intuitionistic logic by exploring the relationship between co-Heyting algebras and topological spaces. First, we discuss the relevant ideas in the setting of Heyting algebras and intuitionistic logic, showing organically the progression from the primordial example of lattices of open sets of topological spaces to more general ways of thinking about Heyting algebras. Then, we adapt the ideas to the dual intuitionistic setting, and use them to prove a number of interesting properties, including a deep relationship both intuitionistic and dual intuitionistic logic share to the modal logic $\mathsf{S4}$.</description>

      <title>A motivic Fundamental Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove motivic versions of the Langlands-Shelstad Fundamental Lemma and Ng\^o's Geometric Stabilization. To achieve this, we follow the strategy from the recent proof by Groechenig, Wyss and Ziegler which avoided the use of perverse sheaves using instead $p$-adic integration and Tate duality. We make a key use of a construction of Denef and Loeser which assigns a virtual motive to any definable set in the theory of pseudo-finite fields.</description>
