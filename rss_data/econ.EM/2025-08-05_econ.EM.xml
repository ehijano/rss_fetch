      <title>A Relaxation Approach to Synthetic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) is widely used for constructing the counterfactual of a treated unit based on data from control units in a donor pool. Allowing the donor pool contains more control units than time periods, we propose a novel machine learning algorithm, named SCM-relaxation, for counterfactual prediction. Our relaxation approach minimizes an information-theoretic measure of the weights subject to a set of relaxed linear inequality constraints in addition to the simplex constraint. When the donor pool exhibits a group structure, SCM-relaxation approximates the equal weights within each group to diversify the prediction risk. Asymptotically, the proposed estimator achieves oracle performance in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy. We demonstrate our method by Monte Carlo simulations and by an empirical application that assesses the economic impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom's real GDP.</description>

      <title>A difference-in-differences estimator by covariate balancing propensity score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a covariate balancing approach for the estimation of treatment effects on the treated (ATT) in a difference-in-differences (DID) research design when panel data are available. We show that the proposed covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) DID estimator possesses several desirable properties: (i) local efficiency, (ii) double robustness in terms of consistency, (iii) double robustness in terms of inference, and (iv) faster convergence to the ATT compared to the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) DID estimators when both working models are locally misspecified. These latter two characteristics set the CBPS DID estimator apart from the AIPW DID estimator theoretically. Simulation studies and an empirical study demonstrate the desirable finite sample performance of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Estimating Causal Effects with Observational Data: Guidelines for Agricultural and Applied Economists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most research questions in agricultural and applied economics are of a causal nature, i.e., how one or more variables (e.g., policies, prices, the weather) affect one or more other variables (e.g., income, crop yields, pollution). Only some of these research questions can be studied experimentally. Most empirical studies in agricultural and applied economics thus rely on observational data. However, estimating causal effects with observational data requires appropriate research designs and a transparent discussion of all identifying assumptions, together with empirical evidence to assess the probability that they hold. This paper provides an overview of various approaches that are frequently used in agricultural and applied economics to estimate causal effects with observational data. It then provides advice and guidelines for agricultural and applied economists who are intending to estimate causal effects with observational data, e.g., how to assess and discuss the chosen identification strategies in their publications.</description>

      <title>Structural Extrapolation in Regression Discontinuity Designs with an Application to School Expenditure Referenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structural approach to extrapolate average partial effects away from the cutoff in regression discontinuity designs (RDDs). Our focus is on applications that exploit closely contested school district referenda to estimate the effects of changes in education spending on local economic outcomes. We embed these outcomes in a spatial equilibrium model of local jurisdictions in which fiscal policy is determined by majority rule voting. This integration provides a microfoundation for the running variable, the share of voters who approve a ballot initiative, and enables identification of structural parameters using RDD coefficients. We then leverage the model to simulate the effects of counterfactual referenda over a broad range of proposed spending changes. These scenarios imply realizations of the running variable away from the threshold, allowing extrapolation of RDD estimates to nonmarginal referenda. Applying the method to school expenditure ballot measures in Wisconsin, we document substantial heterogeneity in housing price capitalization across the approval margin.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Smoothed Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian quantile regression based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) likelihood suffers from two fundamental limitations: the non-differentiability of the check loss precludes gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and the posterior mean provides biased quantile estimates. We propose Bayesian smoothed quantile regression (BSQR), which replaces the check loss with a kernel-smoothed version, creating a continuously differentiable likelihood. This smoothing has two crucial consequences: it enables efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, and it yields a consistent posterior distribution, thereby resolving the inferential bias of the standard approach. We further establish conditions for posterior propriety under various priors (including improper and hierarchical) and characterize how kernel choice affects posterior concentration and computational efficiency. Extensive simulations validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that BSQR achieves up to a 50% reduction in predictive check loss at extreme quantiles compared to ALD-based methods, while improving MCMC efficiency by 20-40% in effective sample size. An empirical application to financial risk measurement during the COVID-19 era illustrates BSQR's practical advantages in capturing dynamic systemic risk. The BSQR framework provides a theoretically-grounded and computationally-efficient solution to longstanding challenges in Bayesian quantile regression, with compact-support kernels like the uniform and triangular emerging as particularly effective choices.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences Estimators When No Unit Remains Untreated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider treatment-effect estimation with a two-periods panel, where units are untreated at period one, and receive strictly positive doses at period two. First, we consider designs with some quasi-untreated units, with a period-two dose local to zero. We show that under a parallel-trends assumption, a weighted average of slopes of units' potential outcomes is identified by a difference-in-difference estimand using quasi-untreated units as the control group. We leverage results from the regression-discontinuity-design literature to propose a nonparametric estimator. Then, we propose estimators for designs without quasi-untreated units. Finally, we propose a test of the homogeneous-effect assumption underlying two-way-fixed-effects regressions.</description>

      <title>GMM and M Estimation under Network Dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents GMM and M estimators and their asymptotic properties for network-dependent data. To this end, I build on Kojevnikov, Marmer, and Song (KMS, 2021) and develop a novel uniform law of large numbers (ULLN), which is essential to ensure desired asymptotic behaviors of nonlinear estimators (e.g., Newey and McFadden, 1994, Section 2). Using this ULLN, I establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of both GMM and M estimators. For practical convenience, complete estimation and inference procedures are also provided.</description>

      <title>Optimal Policy Choices Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policymakers often make changes to policies whose benefits and costs are unknown and must be inferred from statistical estimates in empirical studies. In this paper I consider the problem of a planner who makes local changes to upfront spending on a set of policies to maximize social welfare but faces statistical uncertainty about the impact of those changes. I set up a local optimization problem that is tractable under statistical uncertainty and solve for the local change in spending that maximizes the posterior expected rate of increase in welfare. I propose an empirical Bayes approach to approximating the optimal local spending rule, which solves the planner's local problem with posterior mean estimates of benefits and net costs that have been shrunk to a flexibly estimated prior. I show theoretically that the empirical Bayes approach performs well by deriving rates of convergence for the estimated rate of increase in welfare uniformly over local spending changes and for the rate of increase in welfare achieved by the empirical Bayes spending rule to that achieved by the optimal spending rule. These rates for the empirical Bayes approach converge for a large class of decision problems, including those where rates from a sample plug-in approach do not.</description>

      <title>Yurinskii's Coupling for Martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yurinskii's coupling is a popular theoretical tool for non-asymptotic distributional analysis in mathematical statistics and applied probability, offering a Gaussian strong approximation with an explicit error bound under easily verifiable conditions. Originally stated in $\ell_2$-norm for sums of independent random vectors, it has recently been extended both to the $\ell_p$-norm, for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and to vector-valued martingales in $\ell_2$-norm, under some strong conditions. We present as our main result a Yurinskii coupling for approximate martingales in $\ell_p$-norm, under substantially weaker conditions than those previously imposed. Our formulation further allows for the coupling variable to follow a more general Gaussian mixture distribution, and we provide a novel third-order coupling method which gives tighter approximations in certain settings. We specialize our main result to mixingales, martingales, and independent data, and derive uniform Gaussian mixture strong approximations for martingale empirical processes. Applications to nonparametric partitioning-based and local polynomial regression procedures are provided, alongside central limit theorems for high-dimensional martingale vectors.</description>

      <title>Where the Trees Fall: Macroeconomic Forecasts for Forest-Reliant States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several key states in various regions of the U.S. have experienced recent sawtimber as well as pulp and paper mill closures, which raises an important policy question: how have and will key macroeconomic and industry specific indicators within the U.S. forest sector likely to change over time? This study provides empirical evidence to support forest-sector policy design by using a vector error correction (VEC) model to forecast economic trends in three major industries - forestry and logging, wood manufacturing, and paper manufacturing - across six of the most forest-dependent states found by the location quotient (LQ) measure: Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Overall, the results suggest a general decline in employment and the number of firms in the forestry and logging industry as well as the paper manufacturing industry, while wood manufacturing is projected to see modest employment gains. These results also offer key insights for regional policymakers, industry leaders, and local economic development officials: communities dependent on timber-based manufacturing may be more resilient than other forestry-based industries in the face of economic disruptions. Our findings can help prioritize targeted policy interventions and inform regional economic resilience strategies. We show distinct differences across forest-dependent industries and/or state sectors and geographies, highlighting that policies may have to be specific to each sector and/or geographical area. Finally, our VEC modeling framework is adaptable to other resource-dependent industries that serve as regional economic pillars such as mining, agriculture, and energy production offering a transferable tool for policy analysis in regions with similar economic structures.</description>
