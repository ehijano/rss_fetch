      <title>Information Gradient for Nonlinear Gaussian Channel with Applications to Task-Oriented Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a gradient-based framework for optimizing parametric nonlinear Gaussian channels via mutual information maximization. Leveraging the score-to-Fisher bridge (SFB) methodology, we derive a computationally tractable formula for the information gradient that is the gradient of mutual information with respect to the parameters of the nonlinear front-end. Our formula expresses this gradient in terms of two key components: the score function of the marginal output distribution, which can be learned via denoising score matching (DSM), and the Jacobian of the front-end function, which is handled efficiently using the vector-Jacobian product (VJP) within automatic differentiation frameworks. This enables practical parameter optimization through gradient ascent. Furthermore, we extend this framework to task-oriented scenarios, deriving gradients for both task-specific mutual information, where a task variable depends on the channel input, and the information bottleneck (IB) objective. A key advantage of our approach is that it facilitates end-to-end optimization of the nonlinear front-end without requiring explicit computation on the output distribution. Extensive experimental validation confirms the correctness of our information gradient formula against analytical solutions and demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing both linear and nonlinear channels toward their objectives.</description>

      <title>New Second-Order Achievability Bounds for Coding with Side Information via Type Deviation Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for second-order achievability, called type deviation convergence, that is generally applicable to settings in network information theory, and is especially suitable for lossy source coding and channel coding with cost. We give a second-order achievability bound for lossy source coding with side information at the decoder (Wyner-Ziv problem) that improves upon all known bounds (e.g., Watanabe-Kuzuoka-Tan, Yassaee-Aref-Gohari and Li-Anantharam). We also give second-order achievability bounds for lossy compression where side information may be absent (Heegard-Berger problem) and channels with noncausal state information at the encoder and cost constraint (Gelfand-Pinsker problem with cost) that improve upon previous bounds.</description>

      <title>A Location-Aware Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Dynamic Near-Far Field Channel Estimation in Low-Altitude UAV Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low altitude UAV communications, accurate channel estimation remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of air to ground links, exacerbated by high node mobility and the use of large scale antenna arrays, which introduce hybrid near and far field propagation conditions. While conventional estimation methods rely on far field assumptions, they fail to capture the intricate channel variations in near-field scenarios and overlook valuable geometric priors such as real-time transceiver positions. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a unified channel estimation framework based on a location aware hybrid deep learning architecture. The proposed model synergistically combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction, bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) networks for modeling temporal evolution, and a multihead self attention mechanism to enhance focus on discriminative channel components. Furthermore, real-time transmitter and receiver locations are embedded as geometric priors, improving sensitivity to distance under near field spherical wavefronts and boosting model generalization. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing that it outperforms existing benchmarks by a significant margin, achieving at least a 30.25% reduction in normalized mean square error (NMSE) on average.</description>

      <title>Moving or Predicting? RoleAware-MAPP: A Role-Aware Transformer Framework for Movable Antenna Position Prediction to Secure Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology provides a promising avenue for actively shaping wireless channels through dynamic antenna positioning, thereby enabling electromagnetic radiation reconstruction to enhance physical layer security (PLS). However, its practical deployment is hindered by two major challenges: the high computational complexity of real time optimization and a critical temporal mismatch between slow mechanical movement and rapid channel variations. Although data driven methods have been introduced to alleviate online optimization burdens, they are still constrained by suboptimal training labels derived from conventional solvers or high sample complexity in reinforcement learning. More importantly, existing learning based approaches often overlook communication-specific domain knowledge, particularly the asymmetric roles and adversarial interactions between legitimate users and eavesdroppers, which are fundamental to PLS. To address these issues, this paper reformulates the MA positioning problem as a predictive task and introduces RoleAware-MAPP, a novel Transformer based framework that incorporates domain knowledge through three key components: role-aware embeddings that model user specific intentions, physics-informed semantic features that encapsulate channel propagation characteristics, and a composite loss function that strategically prioritizes secrecy performance over mere geometric accuracy. Extensive simulations under 3GPP-compliant scenarios show that RoleAware-MAPP achieves an average secrecy rate of 0.3569 bps/Hz and a strictly positive secrecy capacity of 81.52%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 48.4% and 5.39 percentage points, respectively, while maintaining robust performance across diverse user velocities and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Mutual Information and Outage Probability for SIM-Assisted Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) is a promising enabler for next-generation high-capacity networks that exhibit better performance compared to its single-layer counterpart by means of just wave propagation. However, the study of ergodic mutual information (EMI) and outage probability for SIM-assisted multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is not available in the literature. To this end, we obtain the distribution of the MI by using large random matrix theory (RMT) tools. Next, we derive a tight closed-form expression for the outage probability based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we apply the gradient descent method for the minimization of the outage probability. Simulation results verify the analytical results and provide fundamental insights such as the performance enhancements compared to conventional MIMO systems and the single-layer counterpart. Notably the proposed optimization algorithm is faster than the alternating optimization (AO) benchmark by saving significant overhead.</description>

      <title>Robust Analog Lagrange Coded Computing: Theory and Algorithms via Discrete Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Lagrange Coded Computing (ALCC) is a recently proposed computational paradigm wherein certain computations over analog datasets are efficiently performed using distributed worker nodes through floating point representation. While the vanilla version of ALCC is known to preserve the privacy of the datasets from the workers and also achieve resilience against stragglers, it is not robust against Byzantine workers that return erroneous results. Highlighting this vulnerability, we propose a secure ALCC framework that is resilient against a wide range of integrity threats from the Byzantine workers. As a foundational step, we use error-correction algorithms for Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codes to build novel reconstruction strategies for ALCC thereby improving its computational accuracy in the presence of a bounded number of Byzantine workers. Furthermore, capitalizing on some theoretical results on the performance of the DFT decoders, we propose novel strategies for distributing the ALCC computational tasks to the workers, and show that such methods significantly improve the accuracy when the workers' trust profiles are available at the master server. Finally, we study the robustness of the proposed framework against colluding attacks, and show that interesting attack strategies can be executed by exploiting the inherent precision noise owing to floating point implementation.</description>

      <title>Adversary-Aware Private Inference over Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks (e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets, protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a model server.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer for Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna is a promising wireless communication technology that enhances communication rate by changing the antenna positions. This article proposes a new communication system that combines multiple-input single-output (MISO) fluid antennas with traditional fixed-position antennas, utilizing antenna position optimization to improve energy harvesting efficiency. In this model, we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) which transmits identical signals from the base station to both information receiver (IR) and energy receiver (ER). We strive to enhance the power delivered to the ER by fine-tuning the positions of transmit and receive fluid antennas, along with optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, subject to a given minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at the IR. Simulation results indicate that fluid antenna systems significantly enhance the energy harvesting efficiency of the ER compared to traditional fixed-position antennas.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for 6G Wireless Networks: Principles, Applications, and Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are expected to deliver ubiquitous connectivity, resilient coverage, and intelligence-driven services in highly dynamic environments. To achieve these goals, distributed wireless architectures such as cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have attracted significant attention due to their scalability and fairness. Recently, stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising evolution of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, offering multi-layer electromagnetic domain processing with enhanced controllability and spatial degrees of freedom. By integrating SIMs into distributed wireless networks, advanced wave-domain operations can be realized, enabling efficient interference management, improved energy and spectral efficiency, and robust physical-layer security. This article provides a comprehensive overview of SIM-aided distributed wireless networks, including their application scenarios, classification, and system architectures. Key signal processing challenges, such as hierarchical frameworks, user association, and joint precoding, are discussed, followed by case studies demonstrating significant performance gains. Finally, future research directions in hardware design, energy consumption modeling, algorithm development, and artificial intelligence integration are highlighted, aiming to pave the way for scalable and intelligent 6G distributed wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Super-Linear Growth of the Capacity-Achieving Input Support for the Amplitude-Constrained AWGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the growth of the support size of the capacity-achieving input distribution for the amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. While it is known since Smith (1971) that the optimal input is discrete with finitely many mass points, tight bounds on the number of support points $K(A)$ as the amplitude constraint $A$ increases remain open. Building on recent work by Dytso \emph{et al.} (2019) and Mattingly \emph{et al.} (2018), we derive a new analytical lower bound showing that $K(A)$ grows super-linearly in $A$. Our approach combines total-variation convergence of the output distribution to the uniform law with quantitative limits on Gaussian mixture approximation.</description>

      <title>MIMO-Zak-OTFS with Superimposed Spread Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of spread pilot design and effective channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output Zak-OTFS (MIMO-Zak-OTFS) with superimposed spread pilots, where data and spread pilot signals are superimposed in the same frame. To achieve good estimation performance in a MIMO setting, the spread pilots at different transmit antennas need to be effectively separated at the receiver. Towards this, we propose a spread pilot design that separates the pilot sequences in the cross-ambiguity domain and enables the estimation of the effective channel taps by a simple read-off operation. To further alleviate the effect of pilot-data interference on performance, we carry out turbo iterations between channel estimation and detection. Simulation results for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ MIMO-Zak-OTFS with Gaussian-sinc pulse shaping filter for vehicular-A channel model show that the proposed pilot design and estimation scheme with three turbo iterations can achieve very good estimation/detection performance.</description>

      <title>Abstain Mask Retain Core: Time Series Prediction by Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations) during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient and robust forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Counterexample to majority optimality in NICD with erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We asked GPT-5 Pro to look for counterexamples among a public list of open problems (the Simons ``Real Analysis in Computer Science'' collection). After several numerical experiments, it suggested a counterexample for the Non-Interactive Correlation Distillation (NICD) with erasures question: namely, a Boolean function on 5 bits that achieves a strictly larger value of $\mathbb{E}|f(z)|$ than the 5-bit majority function when the erasure parameter is $p=0.40.$ In this very short note we record the finding, state the problem precisely, give the explicit function, and verify the computation step by step by hand so that it can be checked without a computer. In addition, we show that for each fixed odd $n$ the majority is optimal (among unbiased Boolean functions) in a neighborhood of $p=0$. We view this as a little spark of an AI contribution in Theoretical Computer Science: while modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often assist with literature and numerics, here a concrete finite counterexample emerged.</description>

      <title>Signal Design for OTFS Dual-Functional Radar and Communications with Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) offers significant advantages in managing mobility for both wireless sensing and communication systems, making it a promising candidate for dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC). However, the optimal signal design that fully exploits OTFS's potential in DFRC has not been sufficiently explored. This paper addresses this gap by formulating an optimization problem for signal design in DFRC-OTFS, incorporating both pilot-symbol design for channel estimation and data-power allocation. Specifically, we employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the ambiguity function as a radar metric, accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. For communication, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. We maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication metrics and solve the optimization problem via an alternating optimization framework. Simulations indicate that the proposed signal significantly improves the sensing-communication performance region compared with conventional signal schemes, achieving at least a 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing, and a 4.82 dB gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for communication.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures, refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.</description>

      <title>Dual Control Reference Generation for Optimal Pick-and-Place Execution under Payload Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism. Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.</description>

      <title>Time-series Random Process Complexity Ranking Using a Bound on Conditional Differential Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future observations given past context. However, its direct computation for high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable. This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models, that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.</description>

      <title>Connecting Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler Divergences: A New Bound for Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information. Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning in MI-based representation learning.</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes in the Lee Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes are a coding framework designed to minimize redundancy while ensuring that specific functions or computations of encoded data can be reliably recovered, even in the presence of errors. The choice of metric is crucial in designing such codes, as it determines which computations must be protected and how errors are measured and corrected. Previous work by Liu and Liu [6] studied function-correcting codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l},\ l\geq 2$ using the homogeneous metric, which coincides with the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. In this paper, we extend the study to codes over $\mathbb{Z}_m,$ for any positive integer $m\geq 2$ under the Lee metric and aim to determine their optimal redundancy. To achieve this, we introduce irregular Lee distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy by characterizing the shortest possible length of such codes. These general bounds are then simplified and applied to specific classes of functions, including Lee-local functions, Lee weight functions, and Lee weight distribution functions. We extend the bounds established by Liu and Liu [6] for codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ in the Lee metric to the more general setting of $\mathbb{Z}_m$.
  Additionally, we explicitly derive a Plotkin-like bound for linear function-correcting codes in the Lee metric. As the Lee metric coincides with the Hamming metric over the binary field, we demonstrate that our bound naturally reduces to a Plotkin-type bound for function-correcting codes under the Hamming metric over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.
  Furthermore, when the underlying function is bijective, function-correcting codes reduce to classical error-correcting codes. In parallel, our bound correspondingly reduces to the classical Plotkin bound for error-correcting codes, both for the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_m$ and for the Hamming metric over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>

      <title>Feedback Lunch: Deep Feedback Codes for Wiretap Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage, illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication, to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02193v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

      <title>Converse bounds for quantum hypothesis exclusion: A divergence-radius approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis exclusion is an information-theoretic task in which an experimenter aims at ruling out a false hypothesis from a finite set of known candidates, and an error occurs if and only if the hypothesis being ruled out is the ground truth. For the tasks of quantum state exclusion and quantum channel exclusion -- where hypotheses are represented by quantum states and quantum channels, respectively -- efficiently computable upper bounds on the asymptotic error exponents were established in a recent work of the current authors [Ji et al., arXiv:2407.13728 (2024)], where the derivation was based on nonasymptotic analysis. In this companion paper of our previous work, we provide alternative proofs for the same upper bounds on the asymptotic error exponents of quantum state and channel exclusion, but using a conceptually different approach from the one adopted in the previous work. Specifically, we apply strong converse results for asymmetric binary hypothesis testing to distinguishing an arbitrary ``dummy'' hypothesis from each of the concerned candidates. This leads to the desired upper bounds in terms of divergence radii via a geometrically inspired argument.</description>

Abstract: Estimating Mutual Information (MI), a key measure of dependence of random quantities without specific modelling assumptions, is a challenging problem in high dimensions. We propose a novel mutual information estimator based on parametrizing conditional densities using normalizing flows, a deep generative model that has gained popularity in recent years. This estimator leverages a block autoregressive structure to achieve improved bias-variance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A,B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the analytic witness gap $\Delta(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$. The sign change of $\Delta(\omega)$ across the Squier positivity window reveals alternating constructive and destructive interference of causal orders, a hallmark of non-Abelian control, while $\Delta(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability. Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a Gedankenexperiment in anyonic statistics.</description>
