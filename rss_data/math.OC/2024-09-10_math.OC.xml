      <title>Pattern based learning and optimisation through pricing for bin packing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a popular form of knowledge and experience, patterns and their identification have been critical tasks in most data mining applications. However, as far as we are aware, no study has systematically examined the dynamics of pattern values and their reuse under varying conditions. We argue that when problem conditions such as the distributions of random variables change, the patterns that performed well in previous circumstances may become less effective and adoption of these patterns would result in sub-optimal solutions. In response, we make a connection between data mining and the duality theory in operations research and propose a novel scheme to efficiently identify patterns and dynamically quantify their values for each specific condition. Our method quantifies the value of patterns based on their ability to satisfy stochastic constraints and their effects on the objective value, allowing high-quality patterns and their combinations to be detected. We use the online bin packing problem to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and illustrate the online packing procedure with the guidance of patterns that address the inherent uncertainty of the problem. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also analysed in detail the distinctive features of the proposed methods that lead to performance improvement and the special cases where our method can be further improved.</description>

      <title>How can a decision maker take into account the evolution of his preferences over time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ranking of possible alternatives during the design or operation of an industrial process leads to the definition of a solution representing the best compromise between several contradictory objectives. The choice of solution is a decision that can be modeled using knowledge of the corresponding preferences. The decision and preference model used is that of flow balances. Munster cheese is used as an example. These are highly distinctive cheeses that are not suitable for uninformed consumers. If the decision-maker wishes to widen his consumer panel, he must modify the production line settings. In the event of a change in preferences due to an external influence, the decision-maker must adapt, but not too abruptly, to avoid both production line oscillations and consumer annoyance. To solve this problem, we propose a new technique: dynamic flow balances. This makes it possible to forecast production trends. Prospects are also proposed, such as the creation of a multi-criteria predictive control.</description>

      <title>Controlled fluid transport by the collective motion of microrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Torque-driven microscale swimming robots, or microrotors, hold significant potential in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery, and micromanipulation. This paper addresses the challenge of controlling the transport of fluid volumes using the flow fields generated by interacting groups of microrotors. Our approach uses polynomial chaos expansions to model the time evolution of fluid particle distributions and formulate an optimal control problem, which we solve numerically. We implement this framework in simulation to achieve the controlled transport of an initial fluid particle distribution to a target destination while minimizing undesirable effects such as stretching and mixing. We consider the case where translational velocities of the rotors are directly controlled, as well as the case where only torques are controlled and the rotors move in response to the collective flow fields they generate. We analyze the solution of this optimal control problem by computing the Lagrangian coherent structures of the associated flow field, which reveal the formation of transport barriers that efficiently guide particles toward their target. This analysis provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of controlled transport.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Gradient-Based Optimization Techniques Using Multidimensional Surface 3D Visualizations and Initial Point Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines several renowned gradient-based optimization techniques and focuses on their computational efficiency and precision. In the study, the steepest descent, conjugate gradient (Fletcher-Reeves and Polak-Ribiere variants), Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton (BFGS), and Levenberg-Marquardt techniques were evaluated. These methods were benchmarked using Rosenbrock's, Spring Force Vanderplaats', Ackley's, and Himmelblau's functions. We emphasize the critical role that initial point selection plays in optimizing optimization outcomes in our analysis. It is also important to distinguish between local and global optima since gradient-based methods may have difficulties dealing with nonlinearity and multimodality. We illustrate optimization trajectories using 3D surface visualizations in order to increase understanding. While gradient-based methods have been demonstrated to be effective, they may be limited by computational constraints and by the nature of the objective functions, necessitating the use of heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms in more complex situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper present the first QUBO formulations for the Snake-in-the-box (SITB) and Coil-in-the-box (CITB) problems. Both formulations are also capable of solving the NP-Hard problems of Maximum induced path and Maximum induced cylce respectively. In the process we also found a new QUBO formulation for the Maximum Common Induced Sub-graph problem. We proved the correctness of our formulations for the SITB, CITB and Maximum Common Sub-graph problem, and tested the formulations of the SITB and CITB in both classical and quantum solvers, being able to get the best solution for up to 5 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Absolute Ranking: An Essential Normalization for Benchmarking Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating performance across optimization algorithms on many problems presents a complex challenge due to the diversity of numerical scales involved. Traditional data processing methods, such as hypothesis testing and Bayesian inference, often employ ranking-based methods to normalize performance values across these varying scales. However, a significant issue emerges with this ranking-based approach: the introduction of new algorithms can potentially disrupt the original rankings. This paper extensively explores the problem, making a compelling case to underscore the issue and conducting a thorough analysis of its root causes. These efforts pave the way for a comprehensive examination of potential solutions. Building on this research, this paper introduces a new mathematical model called "absolute ranking" and a sampling-based computational method. These contributions come with practical implementation recommendations, aimed at providing a more robust framework for addressing the challenge of numerical scale variation in the assessment of performance across multiple algorithms and problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate expected utility maximization problems from the terminal liquidation value in continuous time in markets with transaction costs and one fixed consistent price system, where a non-concave utility function is defined on the positive half real line. The sufficient conditions are given by the convex conjugate of the utility function, then the existence of the optimizer is proved by a maximizing sequence. Finally, we show that the value function of the envelope of the utility function and the concave envelope of the value function are coincide.</description>

      <title>The Strength of Fuel Refueling Location Problem Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fuel Refueling Location Problem (FRLP) is a stylized model for determining the optimal siting of refueling stations for vehicles with limited travel ranges, such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and electric vehicles. This problem becomes particularly relevant when the goal is to facilitate long-distance travel using these vehicles. A variant of the FRLP, known as the Deviation Fuel Refueling Location Problem, accounts for the possibility that drivers may deviate from their preferred routes to ensure sufficient fuel or charging to complete their trips. While solution techniques based on various mathematical programming formulations have been thoroughly explored for these problems, there is a lack of theoretical insights into the relationships and strengths of these formulations. In this work, we study formulations of these problems used in the literature and compare their strengths in terms of linear programming relaxations. Furthermore, we explore approaches to tighten the formulations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Transit on Mobility, Equity, and Economy in the Chicago Metropolitan Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit is essential for urban transportation and achieving net-zero targets. In urban areas like the Chicago Metropolitan Region, transit enhances mobility and connects people, fostering a dynamic economy. To quantify the mobility and selected economic impacts of transit, we use a novel agent-based simulation model POLARIS to compare baseline service against a scenario in which transit is completely removed. The transit-removal scenario assumes higher car ownership and results in higher traffic congestion, numerous activity cancellations, and economic decline. In this scenario, average travel times increase by 14.2% regionally and 34.7% within the City of Chicago. The resulting congestion causes significant activity cancellations despite increased car ownership: 11.8% of non-work and 2.8% of work/school activities regionally, totaling an 8.6% overall cancellation rate. In the city, non-work cancellations would reach 26.9%, and work/school cancellations 7.3%, leading to a 19.9% overall cancellation rate. The impact varies between groups. Women and lower-income individuals are more likely to cancel activities than men and higher-income groups. Women account for 53.7% of non-work and 53.0% of total cancellations. The lowest 40% income group experiences 50.2% of non-work and 48.0% of overall cancellations. Combined, activity cancellations, travel time losses, and increased car ownership cost the region $35.4 billion. With annual public transit funding at $2.7 billion, the ratio is 13 to 1, underscoring transit's critical role in mobility, equity, and economic health.</description>

      <title>Second Order Stein-Variational Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel second-order trajectory optimization algorithm based on Stein Variational Newton's Method and Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming. The proposed algorithm, called Stein Variational Differential Dynamic Programming, is a kernel-based extension of Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming that combines the best of the two worlds of sampling-based and gradient-based optimization. The resulting algorithm avoids known drawbacks of gradient-based dynamic optimization in terms of getting stuck to local minima, while it overcomes limitations of sampling-based stochastic optimization in terms of introducing undesirable stochasticity when applied in online fashion. To test the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, experiments are performed for both trajectory optimization and model predictive control. The experiments include comparisons with unimodal and multimodal Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming as well as Model Predictive Path Integral Control and its multimodal and Stein Variational extensions. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms and confirm the hypothesis that there is a middle ground between sampling and gradient-based optimization that is indeed beneficial for the purposes of dynamic optimization. This middle ground consists of different mechanisms that combine sampling with gradient-based optimization. In this paper, we investigate these different mechanisms and show their benefits in dealing with non-convex dynamic optimization problems found in trajectory optimization and model predictive control.</description>

Abstract: Recently the away-step Frank-Wolfe algoritm for constrained multiobjective optimization has been shown linear convergence rate over a polytope which is generated by finite points set. In this paper we design a decomposition-invariant pairwise frank-wolfe algorithm for multiobjective optimization that the feasible region is an arbitrary bounded polytope. We prove it has linear convergence rate of the whole sequence to a pareto optimal solution under strongly convexity without other assumptions.</description>

      <title>Data-driven multifidelity topology design with multi-channel variational auto-encoder for concurrent optimization of multiple design variable fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to establish a gradient-free topology optimization framework that facilitates more global solution searches to avoid entrapping in undesirable local optima, especially in problems with strong non-linearity. The framework utilizes a data-driven multifidelity topology design, where solution candidates resulting from low-fidelity optimization problems are iteratively updated by a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and high-fidelity (HF) evaluation. A key step in the solution update involves constructing HF models by extruding VAE-generated material distributions to a constant thickness (the HF modeling parameter) across all candidates, which limits exploration of the parameter space and requires extensive parametric studies outside the optimization loop. To achieve comprehensive optimization in a single run, we propose a multi-channel image data architecture that stores material distributions and HF modeling parameters in separate channels, allowing simultaneous optimization of the HF parameter space. We demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed framework by solving a maximum stress minimization problem, characterized by strong non-linearity due to its minimax formulation.</description>

      <title>Geometric commutation principle for weakly spectral sets in Euclidean Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric commutation principle in Euclidean Jordan algebra, recently proved by Gowda, says that, for any spectral set $E$ in a Euclidean Jordan algebra $V$ and $a \in E$, $a$ strongly operator commutes with every element in the normal cone $N_E(a)$. Further, it can be used to establish strong operator commutativity relations in certain optimization problems. Knowing that every spectral sets are special cases of broader class of weakly spectral sets, we prove an analog of a geometric commutation principle for weakly spectral sets and study its consequences and applications.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Online Distributed Seeking for Generalized Nash Equilibrium of Nonmonotone Online Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper mainly investigates a class of distributed generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking problems for online nonmonotone game with time-varying coupling inequality constraints. Based on a time-varying control gain, a novel continuous-time distributed GNE seeking algorithm is proposed, which realizes the constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound, matching those of the criteria for online optimization problems. Furthermore, to reduce unnecessary communication among players, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism involving internal variables is introduced into the distributed GNE seeking algorithm, while the constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound are still achieved. Also, the Zeno behavior is strictly prohibited. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A line search filter sequential adaptive cubic regularisation algorithm for nonlinearly constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a sequential adaptive regularization algorithm using cubics (ARC) is presented to solve nonlinear equality constrained optimization. It is motivated by the idea of handling constraints in sequential quadratic programming methods. In each iteration, we decompose the new step into the sum of the normal step and the tangential step by using composite step approaches. Using a projective matrix, we transform the constrained ARC subproblem into a standard ARC subproblem which generates the tangential step. After the new step is computed, we employ line search filter techniques to generate the next iteration point. Line search filter techniques enable the algorithm to avoid the difficulty of choosing an appropriate penalty parameter in merit functions and the possibility of solving ARC subproblem many times in one iteration in ARC framework. Global convergence is analyzed under some mild assumptions. Preliminary numerical results and comparison are reported.</description>

      <title>Cornell University Uses Integer Programming to Optimize Final Exam Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an integer programming-based optimization framework designed to effectively address the complex final exam scheduling challenges encountered at Cornell University. With high flexibility, the framework is specifically tailored to accommodate a variety of different constraints, including the front-loading of large courses and the exclusion of specific time slots during the exam period. By generating multiple scheduling model variants and incorporating heuristic approaches, our framework enables comprehensive comparisons of different schedules. This empowers the University Registrar to make informed decisions, considering trade-offs in terms of schedule comfort measured by different levels of exam conflicts. Our results demonstrate significant advantage over the historical lecture time-based approach, providing time and effort savings for the university administration while enhancing student and faculty satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Learning nonnegative matrix factorizations from compressed data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a flexible and theoretically supported framework for scalable nonnegative matrix factorization. The goal is to find nonnegative low-rank components directly from compressed measurements, accessing the original data only once or twice. We consider compression through randomized sketching methods that can be adapted to the data, or can be oblivious. We formulate optimization problems that only depend on the compressed data, but which can recover a nonnegative factorization which closely approximates the original matrix. The defined problems can be approached with a variety of algorithms, and in particular, we discuss variations of the popular multiplicative updates method for these compressed problems. We demonstrate the success of our approaches empirically and validate their performance in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Double Tracking Method for Optimization with Decentralized Generalized Orthogonality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the decentralized optimization problems with generalized orthogonality constraints, where both the objective function and the constraint exhibit a distributed structure. Such optimization problems, albeit ubiquitous in practical applications, remain unsolvable by existing algorithms in the presence of distributed constraints. To address this issue, we convert the original problem into an unconstrained penalty model by resorting to the recently proposed constraint-dissolving operator. However, this transformation compromises the essential property of separability in the resulting penalty function, rendering it impossible to employ existing algorithms to solve. We overcome this difficulty by introducing a novel algorithm that tracks the gradient of the objective function and the Jacobian of the constraint mapping simultaneously. The global convergence guarantee is rigorously established with an iteration complexity. To substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, we present numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We integrate the diagonal quasi-Newton update approach with the enhanced BFGS formula proposed by Wei, Z., Yu, G., Yuan, G., Lian, Z. \cite{b1}, incorporating extrapolation techniques and inertia acceleration technology. This method, designed specifically for non-convex constrained problems, requires that the search direction ensures sufficient descent and establishes global linear convergence. Such a design has yielded exceptionally favorable data results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Convergence Analysis of AdaGrad for Non-Convex Optimization via Novel Stopping Time-based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optimizers have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on iterative gradients. These adaptive methods have significantly succeeded in various deep learning tasks, outperforming stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, although AdaGrad is a cornerstone adaptive optimizer, its theoretical analysis is inadequate in addressing asymptotic convergence and non-asymptotic convergence rates on non-convex optimization. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and complete picture of AdaGrad. We first introduce a novel stopping time technique from probabilistic theory to establish stability for the norm version of AdaGrad under milder conditions. We further derive two forms of asymptotic convergence: almost sure and mean-square. Furthermore, we demonstrate the near-optimal non-asymptotic convergence rate measured by the average-squared gradients in expectation, which is rarely explored and stronger than the existing high-probability results, under the mild assumptions. The techniques developed in this work are potentially independent of interest for future research on other adaptive stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Inertial Bregman Proximal DC Algorithm for Generalized DC Programming with Application to Data Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of generalized difference-of-convex functions (DC) programming, whose objective is the difference of two convex (not necessarily smooth) functions plus a decomposable (possibly nonconvex) function with Lipschitz gradient. By employing the Fenchel-Young inequality and Moreau decomposition theorem, we introduce an inertial Bregman proximal DC algorithm to solve the problem under consideration. Our algorithmic framework is able to fully exploit the decomposable structure of the generalized DC programming such that each subproblem of the algorithm is enough easy in many cases. Theoretically, we show that the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm globally converges to a critical point under the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. A series of numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm runs efficiently on matrix and tensor completion problems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Optimal Size of Grid-forming Energy Storage in an Off-grid Renewable P2H System under Multi-timescale Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utility-scale off-grid renewable power-to-hydrogen systems (OReP2HSs) typically include photovoltaic plants, wind turbines, electrolyzers (ELs), and energy storage systems. As an island system, OReP2HS requires at least one component, generally the battery energy storage system (BESS), that operates for grid-forming control to provide frequency and voltage references and regulate them through transient power support and short-term energy balance regulation. While larger BESS capacity increases this ability, it also raises investment costs. This paper proposes a framework of layered multi-timescale energy management system (EMS) and evaluates the most cost-effective size of the grid-forming BESS in the OReP2HS. The proposed EMS covers the timescales ranging from those for power system transient behaviors to intra-day scheduling, coordinating renewable power, BESS, and ELs. Then, an iterative search procedure based on high-fidelity simulation is employed to determine the size of the BESS with minimal levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Simulations over a reference year, based on the data from a planned OReP2HS project in Inner Mongolia, China, show that with the proposed EMS, the base-case optimal LCOH is 33.212 CNY/kg (4.581 USD/kg). The capital expenditure of the BESS accounts for 17.83% of the total, and the optimal BESS size accounts for 13.6% of the rated hourly energy output of power sources. Sensitivity analysis reveals that by reducing the electrolytic load adjustment time step from 90 to 5 s and increasing its ramping limit from 1% to 10% rated power per second, the BESS size decreases by 53.57%, and the LCOH decreases to 25.458 CNY/kg (3.511 USD/kg). Considering the cost of designing and manufacturing utility-scale ELs with fast load regulation capability, a load adjustment time step of 5-10 s and a ramping limit of 4-6% rated power per second are recommended.</description>

Abstract: Many stochastic optimization problems in multi-agent systems can be decomposed into smaller subproblems or reduced decision subspaces. The cyclic and distributed approaches are two widely used strategies for solving such problems. In this manuscript, we review four existing methods for addressing these problems and compare them based on their suitable problem frameworks and update rules.</description>

      <title>Covert Vehicle Misguidance and Its Detection: A Hypothesis Testing Game over Continuous-Time Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic zero-sum game to analyze the competition between the attacker, who tries to covertly misguide the vehicle to an unsafe region, versus the detector, who tries to detect the attack signal based on the observed trajectory of the vehicle. Based on Girsanov's theorem and the generalized Neyman-Pearson lemma, we show that a constant bias injection attack as the attacker's strategy and a likelihood ratio test as the detector's strategy constitute the unique saddle point of the game. We also derive the first-order and the second-order exponents of the type II error as a function of the data length.</description>

      <title>A Unified Analysis of Saddle Flow Dynamics: Stability and Algorithm Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the conditions for asymptotic and exponential convergence of saddle flow dynamics of convex-concave functions. First, we propose an observability-based certificate for asymptotic convergence, directly bridging the gap between the invariant set in a LaSalle argument and the equilibrium set of saddle flows. This certificate generalizes conventional conditions for convergence, e.g., strict convexity-concavity, and leads to a novel state-augmentation method that requires minimal assumptions for asymptotic convergence. We also show that global exponential stability follows from strong convexity-strong concavity, providing a lower-bound estimate of the convergence rate. This insight also explains the convergence of proximal saddle flows for strongly convex-concave objective functions. Our results generalize to dynamics with projections on the vector field and have applications in solving constrained convex optimization via primal-dual methods. Based on these insights, we study four algorithms built upon different Lagrangian function transformations. We validate our work by applying these methods to solve a network flow optimization and a Lasso regression problem.</description>

      <title>Tikhonov regularized inertial primal-dual dynamics for convex-concave bilinear saddle point problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for a convex-concave bilinear saddle point problem, we propose a Tikhonov regularized second-order primal-dual dynamical system with slow damping, extrapolation and general time scaling parameters. Depending on the vanishing speed of the rescaled regularization parameter (i.e., the product of Tikhonov regularization parameter and general time scaling parameter), we analyze the convergence properties of the trajectory generated by the dynamical system. When the rescaled regularization parameter decreases rapidly to zero, we obtain convergence rates of the primal-dual gap and velocity vector along the trajectory generated by the dynamical system. In the case that the rescaled regularization parameter tends slowly to zero, we show the strong convergence of the trajectory towards the minimal norm solution of the convex-concave bilinear saddle point problem. Further, we also present some numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of identifying the integer feasibility of reverse convex sets. We present various settings where the complexity can be either NP-Hard or efficiently solvable when the dimension is fixed. Of particular interest is the case of bounded reverse convex constraints with a polyhedral domain. We introduce a structure, \emph{Boundary Hyperplane Cover}, that permits this problem to be solved in polynomial time in fixed dimension provided the number of nonlinear reverse convex sets is fixed.</description>

      <title>Continuous Relaxation of Discontinuous Shrinkage Operator: Proximal Inclusion and Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a principled way of deriving a continuous relaxation of a given discontinuous shrinkage operator, which is based on a couple of fundamental results. First, the image of a point with respect to the ``set-valued'' proximity operator of a nonconvex function is included by that for its lower semicontinuous (l.s.c.) 1-weakly-convex envelope. Second, the ``set-valued'' proximity operator of a proper l.s.c. 1-weakly-convex function is converted, via double inversion, to a ``single-valued'' proximity operator which is Lipschitz continuous. As a specific example, we derive a continuous relaxation of the discontinuous shrinkage operator associated with the reversely ordered weighted $\ell_1$ (ROWL) penalty. Numerical examples demonstrate potential advantages of the continuous relaxation.</description>

      <title>A study on two-metric projection methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-metric projection method is a simple yet elegant algorithm proposed by Bertsekas in 1984 to address bound/box-constrained optimization problems. The algorithm's low per-iteration cost and potential for using Hessian information makes it a favourable computation method for this problem class. However, its global convergence guarantee is not studied in the nonconvex regime. In our work, we first investigate the global complexity of such a method for finding first-order stationary solution. After properly scaling each step, we equip the algorithm with competitive complexity guarantees. Furthermore, we generalize the two-metric projection method for solving $\ell_1$-norm minimization and discuss its properties via theoretical statements and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis with Almost Sure Convergence for OBF-ARX Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the output prediction problem for an unknown Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system. In particular, we focus our attention on the OBF-ARX filter, whose transfer function is a linear combination of Orthogonal Basis Functions (OBFs), with the coefficients determined by solving a least-squares regression. We prove that the OBF-ARX filter is an accurate approximation of the Kalman Filter (KF) by quantifying its online performance. Specifically, we analyze the average regret between the OBF-ARX filter and the KF, proving that the average regret over $N$ time steps converges to the asymptotic bias at the speed of $O(N^{-0.5+\epsilon})$ almost surely for all $\epsilon&gt;0$. Then, we establish an upper bound on the asymptotic bias, demonstrating that it decreases exponentially with the number of OBF bases, and the decreasing rate $\tau(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{\mu})$ explicitly depends on the poles of both the KF and the OBF. Numerical results on diffusion processes validate the derived bounds.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Quantification of Real-Time Aggregate Power Flexibility of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) can be aggregated to offer flexibility services to the power system. However, the rapid growth in EV adoption leads to increased grid-level carbon emissions due to higher EV charging demand, complicating grid decarbonization efforts. Quantifying and managing EV flexibility while controlling carbon emissions is crucial. This paper introduces a methodology for carbon-aware quantification of real-time aggregate EV power flexibility. An offline model is first developed to determine the upper and lower bounds of the EV flexibility region. To address uncertainties in EV charging behaviors and grid carbon intensity, we propose a carbon-aware online optimization algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization, incorporating a queue model to capture system dynamics. To enhance EV flexibility, we integrate dispatch signals from the system operator into the queue update through a two-stage disaggregation process. The proposed approach is prediction-free and adaptable to various uncertainties. Additionally, the maximum charging delay for EV charging tasks is theoretically bounded by a constant, and carbon emissions are effectively controlled. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online method and highlight its advantages over several benchmarks through comparisons.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces-assisted Positioning Service in 5G Networks with Flexible Numerology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate positioning is paramount for a wide array of location-based services (LBS) in fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. Recent advances in 5G New Radio (NR) technology holds promise for very high-precision positioning services. Yet, challenges arise due to diverse types of numerology and massive connected devices. This paper presents a novel approach to improve positioning precision within a 5G NR framework with comb patterns on time-frequency resource mapping. We then formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the maximum users' positioning error in an intelligent reflected surface (IRS)-assisted 5G network by controlling the user-anchor association, numerology-related selection, IRS's reflecting elements, privacy protection level, and transmit power. To address the non-convex nature of the underlying mixed-integer non-convex problem (MINLP), we propose an efficient algorithm that combines optimization, matching, and learning techniques. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in minimizing positioning errors compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines finite zero-sum stochastic games and demonstrates that when the game's duration is sufficiently long, there exists a pair of approximately optimal strategies such that the expected average payoff at any point in the game remains close to the value. This property, known as the \textit{constant payoff property}, was previously established only for absorbing games and discounted stochastic games.</description>

      <title>Real-time optimal control of high-dimensional parametrized systems by deep learning-based reduced order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering a system towards a desired target in a very short amount of time is challenging from a computational standpoint. Indeed, the intrinsically iterative nature of optimal control problems requires multiple simulations of the physical system to be controlled. Moreover, the control action needs to be updated whenever the underlying scenario undergoes variations. Full-order models based on, e.g., the Finite Element Method, do not meet these requirements due to the computational burden they usually entail. On the other hand, conventional reduced order modeling techniques such as the Reduced Basis method, are intrusive, rely on a linear superimposition of modes, and lack of efficiency when addressing nonlinear time-dependent dynamics. In this work, we propose a non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Modeling (DL-ROM) technique for the rapid control of systems described in terms of parametrized PDEs in multiple scenarios. In particular, optimal full-order snapshots are generated and properly reduced by either Proper Orthogonal Decomposition or deep autoencoders (or a combination thereof) while feedforward neural networks are exploited to learn the map from scenario parameters to reduced optimal solutions. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction therefore allows us to consider state variables and control actions that are both low-dimensional and distributed. After (i) data generation, (ii) dimensionality reduction, and (iii) neural networks training in the offline phase, optimal control strategies can be rapidly retrieved in an online phase for any scenario of interest. The computational speedup and the high accuracy obtained with the proposed approach are assessed on different PDE-constrained optimization problems, ranging from the minimization of energy dissipation in incompressible flows modelled through Navier-Stokes equations to the thermal active cooling in heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Combining supervised learning and local search for the multicommodity capacitated fixed-charge network design problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multicommodity capacitated fixed-charge network design problem has been extensively studied in the literature due to its wide range of applications. Despite the fact that many sophisticated solution methods exist today, finding high-quality solutions to large-scale instances remains challenging. In this paper, we explore how a data-driven approach can help improve upon the state of the art. By leveraging machine learning models, we attempt to reveal patterns hidden in the data that might be difficult to capture with traditional optimization methods. For scalability, we propose a prediction method where the machine learning model is called at the level of each arc of the graph. We take advantage of off-the-shelf models trained via supervised learning to predict near-optimal solutions. Our experimental results include an algorithm design analysis that compares various integration strategies of predictions within local search algorithms. We benchmark the ML-based approach with respect to the state-of-the-art heuristic for this problem. The findings indicate that our method can outperform the leading heuristic on sets of instances sampled from a uniform distribution.</description>

      <title>Functional H_infity Filtering for Descriptor Systems with Monotone nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to design of functional H_\infty filters for a class of nonlinear descriptor systems subjected to disturbances. Departing from conventional assumptions regarding system regularity, we adopt a more inclusive approach by considering general descriptor systems that satisfy a rank condition on their coefficient matrices. Under this rank condition, we establish a linear matrix inequality (LMI) as a sufficient criterion ensuring the stability of the error system and constraining the L 2 gain of the mapping from disturbances to errors to a predetermined level. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a practical example involving a simple constrained mechanical system.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Solving Rare MIP Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) has been extensively applied in areas requiring mathematical solvers to address complex instances within tight time constraints. However, as the problem scale increases, the complexity of model formulation and finding feasible solutions escalates significantly. In contrast, the model-building cost for end-to-end models, such as large language models (LLMs), remains largely unaffected by problem scale due to their pattern recognition capabilities. While LLMs, like GPT-4, without fine-tuning, can handle some traditional medium-scale MIP problems, they struggle with uncommon or highly specialized MIP scenarios. Fine-tuning LLMs can yield some feasible solutions for medium-scale MIP instances, but these models typically fail to explore diverse solutions when constrained by a low and constant temperature, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a recursively dynamic temperature method integrated with a chain-of-thought approach. Our findings show that starting with a high temperature and gradually lowering it leads to better feasible solutions compared to other dynamic temperature strategies. Additionally, by comparing results generated by the LLM with those from Gurobi, we demonstrate that the LLM can produce solutions that complement traditional solvers by accelerating the pruning process and improving overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov game framework is widely used to model interactions among agents with heterogeneous utilities in dynamic and uncertain societal-scale systems. In these systems, agents typically operate in a decentralized manner due to privacy and scalability concerns, often acting without any information about other agents. The design and analysis of decentralized learning algorithms that provably converge to rational outcomes remain elusive, especially beyond Markov zero-sum games and Markov potential games, which do not adequately capture the nature of many real-world interactions that is neither fully competitive nor fully cooperative. This paper investigates the design of decentralized learning algorithms for general-sum Markov games, aiming to provide provable guarantees of convergence to approximate Nash equilibria in the long run. Our approach builds on constructing a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) to address the intractability of designing algorithms that converge to exact Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that MNPFs play a central role in ensuring the convergence of an actor-critic-based decentralized learning algorithm to approximate Nash equilibria. By leveraging a two-timescale approach, where Q-function estimates are updated faster than policy updates, we show that the system converges to a level set of the MNPF over the set of approximate Nash equilibria. This convergence result is further strengthened if the set of Nash equilibria is assumed to be finite. Our findings provide a new perspective on the analysis and design of decentralized learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsed light sources are a critical component of modern lithography, with fine light beam wavelength control paramount for wafer etching accuracy. We study optimal wavelength control by casting it as a decentralized linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem in presence of time-delays. In particular, we consider the multi-optics module (optics and actuators) used for generating the requisite wavelength in light sources as cooperatively interacting systems defined over a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We show that any measurement and other continuous time-delays can be exactly compensated, and the resulting optimal controller implementation at the individual optics-level outperforms any existing wavelength control techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimization Hyper-parameter Laws for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have driven significant AI advancements, yet their training is resource-intensive and highly sensitive to hyper-parameter selection. While scaling laws provide valuable guidance on model size and data requirements, they fall short in choosing dynamic hyper-parameters, such as learning-rate (LR) schedules, that evolve during training. To bridge this gap, we present Optimization Hyper-parameter Laws (Opt-Laws), a framework that effectively captures the relationship between hyper-parameters and training outcomes, enabling the pre-selection of potential optimal schedules. Grounded in stochastic differential equations, Opt-Laws introduce novel mathematical interpretability and offer a robust theoretical foundation for some popular LR schedules. Our extensive validation across diverse model sizes and data scales demonstrates Opt-Laws' ability to accurately predict training loss and identify optimal LR schedule candidates in pre-training, continual training, and fine-tuning scenarios. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while enhancing overall model performance.</description>

      <title>FreeAugment: Data Augmentation Search Across All Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation has become an integral part of deep learning, as it is known to improve the generalization capabilities of neural networks. Since the most effective set of image transformations differs between tasks and domains, automatic data augmentation search aims to alleviate the extreme burden of manually finding the optimal image transformations. However, current methods are not able to jointly optimize all degrees of freedom: (1) the number of transformations to be applied, their (2) types, (3) order, and (4) magnitudes. Many existing methods risk picking the same transformation more than once, limit the search to two transformations only, or search for the number of transformations exhaustively or iteratively in a myopic manner. Our approach, FreeAugment, is the first to achieve global optimization of all four degrees of freedom simultaneously, using a fully differentiable method. It efficiently learns the number of transformations and a probability distribution over their permutations, inherently refraining from redundant repetition while sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that this joint learning of all degrees of freedom significantly improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on various natural image benchmarks and beyond across other domains.

      <title>Reward-Directed Score-Based Diffusion Models via q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) formulation for training continuous-time score-based diffusion models for generative AI to generate samples that maximize reward functions while keeping the generated distributions close to the unknown target data distributions. Different from most existing studies, our formulation does not involve any pretrained model for the unknown score functions of the noise-perturbed data distributions. We present an entropy-regularized continuous-time RL problem and show that the optimal stochastic policy has a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix. Based on this result, we parameterize the mean of Gaussian policies and develop an actor-critic type (little) q-learning algorithm to solve the RL problem. A key ingredient in our algorithm design is to obtain noisy observations from the unknown score function via a ratio estimator. Numerically, we show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with two state-of-the-art RL methods that fine-tune pretrained models. Finally, we discuss extensions of our RL formulation to probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models and to conditional diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Stable Matching with Contingent Priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using school choice as a motivating example, we introduce a stylized model of a many-to-one matching market where the clearinghouse aims to implement contingent priorities, i.e., priorities that depend on the current assignment, to prioritize students with siblings and match them together. We provide a series of guidelines and introduce two natural approaches to implement them: (i) absolute, whereby a prioritized student can displace any student without siblings assigned to the school, and (ii) partial, whereby prioritized students can only displace students that have a less favorable lottery than their priority provider. We study several properties of the corresponding mechanisms, including the existence of a stable assignment under contingent priorities, the complexity of deciding whether there exists one, and its incentive properties. Furthermore, we introduce a soft version of these priorities to guarantee existence, and we provide mathematical programming formulations to find such stable matching or certify that one does not exist. Finally, using data from the Chilean school choice system, we show that our framework can significantly increase the number of students assigned to their top preference and the number of siblings assigned together relative to current practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a new $\Delta$-evaluation method is introduced for solving a column permutation problem defined on a sparse binary matrix with the consecutive ones property. This problem models various $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems in graph theory and industrial manufacturing contexts. The computational experiments compare the processing time of the $\Delta$-evaluation method with two other methods used in well-known local search procedures. The study considers a comprehensive set of instances of well-known problems, such as Gate Matrix Layout and Minimization of Open Stacks. The proposed evaluation method is generally competitive and particularly useful for large and dense instances. It can be easily integrated into local search and metaheuristic algorithms to improve solutions without significantly increasing processing time.</description>

      <title>Towards Fast Rates for Federated and Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting involving $N$ agents, where each agent interacts with an environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The agents' MDPs differ in their reward functions, capturing heterogeneous objectives/tasks. The collective goal of the agents is to communicate intermittently via a central server to find a policy that maximizes the average of long-term cumulative rewards across environments. The limited existing work on this topic either only provide asymptotic rates, or generate biased policies, or fail to establish any benefits of collaboration. In response, we propose Fast-FedPG - a novel federated policy gradient algorithm with a carefully designed bias-correction mechanism. Under a gradient-domination condition, we prove that our algorithm guarantees (i) fast linear convergence with exact gradients, and (ii) sub-linear rates that enjoy a linear speedup w.r.t. the number of agents with noisy, truncated policy gradients. Notably, in each case, the convergence is to a globally optimal policy with no heterogeneity-induced bias. In the absence of gradient-domination, we establish convergence to a first-order stationary point at a rate that continues to benefit from collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In realistic distributed optimization scenarios, individual nodes possess only partial information and communicate over bandwidth constrained channels. For this reason, the development of efficient distributed algorithms is essential. In our paper we addresses the challenge of unconstrained distributed optimization. In our scenario each node's local function exhibits strong convexity with Lipschitz continuous gradients. The exchange of information between nodes occurs through $3$-bit bandwidth-limited channels (i.e., nodes exchange messages represented by a only $3$-bits). Our proposed algorithm respects the network's bandwidth constraints by leveraging zoom-in and zoom-out operations to adjust quantizer parameters dynamically. We show that during our algorithm's operation nodes are able to converge to the exact optimal solution. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate to the optimal solution. We conclude the paper with simulations that highlight our algorithm's unique characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volunteer's dilemma is a well-known game in game theory that models the conflict players face when deciding whether to volunteer for a collective benefit, knowing that volunteering incurs a personal cost. In this work, we introduce a quantum variant of the classical volunteer's dilemma, generalizing it by allowing players to utilize quantum strategies. Employing the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantization framework, we analyze a multiplayer quantum volunteer's dilemma scenario with an arbitrary number of players, where the cost of volunteering is shared equally among the volunteers. We derive analytical expressions for the players' expected payoffs and demonstrate the quantum game's advantage over the classical game. In particular, we prove that the quantum volunteer's dilemma possesses symmetric Nash equilibria with larger expected payoffs compared to the unique symmetric Nash equilibrium of the classical game, wherein players use mixed strategies. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Nash equilibria we identify are Pareto optimal. Our findings reveal distinct dynamics in volunteer's dilemma scenarios when players adhere to quantum rules, underscoring a strategic advantage of decision-making in quantum settings.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for controlling surgical robotic systems, while complying with the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint in Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RA-MIS). In this approach, the RCM-constraint is upheld algorithmically, providing flexibility in the positioning of the insertion point and enabling compatibility with a wide range of general-purpose robots. The paper further investigates the impact of the tool's insertion ratio on the RCM-error, and introduces a manipulability index of the robot which considers the RCM-error that it is used to find a starting configuration. To accurately evaluate the proposed method's trajectory tracking within an RCM-constrained environment, an electromagnetic tracking system is employed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the RCM constraint problem in RA-MIS.</description>

Abstract: The choice of relaxation parameter in the projected successive overrelaxation (PSOR) method for nonnegative quadratic programming problems is problem-dependent. We present novel adaptive PSOR algorithms that adaptively control the relaxation parameter using the Wolfe conditions. The method and its variants can be applied to various problems without requiring additional assumptions, barring the positive semidefiniteness concerning the matrix that defines the objective function, and the cost for updating the parameter is negligible in the whole iteration. Numerical experiments show that the proposed methods often perform comparably to (or sometimes superior to) the PSOR method with a nearly optimal relaxation parameter.</description>

      <title>Operation of an ambulance fleet under uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new optimization models for the dispatch of ambulances. The first model, called the ambulance selection problem, is used when an emergency call arrives to decide whether an ambulance should be dispatched for that call, and if so, which ambulance should be dispatched, or whether the request should be put in a queue of waiting requests. The second model, called the ambulance reassignment problem, is used when an ambulance finishes its current task to decide whether the ambulance should be dispatched to a request waiting in queue, and if so, which request, or whether the ambulance should be dispatched to an ambulance staging location, and if so, which ambulance staging location. These decisions affect not only the emergency call and ambulance under consideration, but also the ability of the ambulance fleet to service future calls. There is uncertainty regarding the locations, arrival times, and types of future calls. We propose a rolling horizon approach that combines the current decisions to be made as first-stage decisions with second-stage models that represent the ability of the ambulance fleet to service future calls. The second-stage optimization problems can be formulated as large-scale deterministic integer linear programs. We propose a column generation algorithm to solve the continuous relaxation of these second-stage problems. The optimal objective values of these second-stage continuous relaxations are used to make approximately optimal first-stage decisions. We compare our resulting dispatch policy with popular decision rules for Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service, based on data of more than 2 years of emergency calls for that service. These tests show that our proposed policy results in smaller response times than the popular decision rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00303v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the twice epi-differentiability and parabolic regularity of a class of non-amenable functions, the composition of a piecewise twice differentiable (PWTD) function and a parabolically semidifferentiable mapping. Such composite functions often appear in composite optimization problems, disjunctive optimization problems, and low-rank and/or sparsity optimization problems. By establishing the proper twice epi-differentiability and parabolic epi-differentiability of PWTD functions, we prove the parabolic epi-differentiability of this class of composite functions, and its twice epi-differentiability under the parabolic regularity assumption. Then, we identify a condition to ensure its parabolic regularity with the help of an upper and lower estimate of its second subderivative, and demonstrate that this condition holds for several classes of specific non-amenable functions.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence to non-isolated minima: four equivalent conditions for $\mathrm{C}^2$ functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms can see their local convergence rates deteriorate when the Hessian at the optimum is singular. These singularities are inescapable when the optima are non-isolated. Yet, under the right circumstances, several algorithms preserve their favorable rates even when optima form a continuum (e.g., due to over-parameterization). This has been explained under various structural assumptions, including the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, Quadratic Growth and the Error Bound. We show that, for cost functions which are twice continuously differentiable ($\mathrm{C}^2$), those three (local) properties are equivalent. Moreover, we show they are equivalent to the Morse--Bott property, that is, local minima form differentiable submanifolds, and the Hessian of the cost function is positive definite along its normal directions. We leverage this insight to improve local convergence guarantees for safe-guarded Newton-type methods under any (hence all) of the above assumptions. First, for adaptive cubic regularization, we secure quadratic convergence even with inexact subproblem solvers. Second, for trust-region methods, we argue convergence can fail with an exact subproblem solver, then proceed to show linear convergence with an inexact one (Cauchy steps).</description>

      <title>The Cooperative Maximal Covering Location Problem with ordered partial attractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) is a classical location problem where a company maximizes the demand covered by placing a given number of facilities, and each demand node is covered if the closest facility is within a predetermined radius. In the cooperative version of the problem (CMCLP), it is assumed that the facilities of the decision maker act cooperatively to increase the customersz' attraction towards the company. In this sense, a demand node is covered if the aggregated partial attractions (or partial coverings) of open facilities exceed a threshold. In this work, we generalize the CMCLP introducing an Ordered Median function (OMf), a function that assigns importance weights to the sorted partial attractions of each customer and then aggregates the weighted attractions to provide the total level of attraction. We name this problem the Ordered Cooperative Maximum Covering Location Problem (OCMCLP). The OMf serves as a means to compute the total attraction of each customer to the company as an aggregation of ordered partial attractions and constitutes a unifying framework for CMCLP models.
  We introduce a multiperiod stochastic non-linear formulation for the CMCLP with an embedded assignment problem characterizing the ordered cooperative covering. For this model, two exact solution approaches are presented: a MILP reformulation with valid inequalities and an effective approach based on Generalized Benders' cuts. Extensive computational experiments are provided to test our results with randomly generated data and the problem is illustrated with a case study of locating charging stations for electric vehicles in the city of Trois-Rivi\`eres, Qu\'ebec (Canada).</description>

      <title>Multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equations and zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games with non-Markovian regime switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games in a regime switching model. The coefficients of the games depend on the underlying noises, so it is a non-Markovian regime switching model. Based on the solutions of a new kind of multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equation (SRE) and a multidimensional linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with unbounded coefficients, we provide closed-loop optimal feedback control-strategy pairs for the two players. The main contribution of this paper, which is of great importance in its own right from the BSDE theory point of view, is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the new kind of SRE. Notably, the first component of the solution (as a process) is capable of taking positive and negative values simultaneously. For homogeneous systems, we obtain the optimal feedback control-strategy pairs under general closed convex cone control constraints. Finally, these results are applied to portfolio selection games with full or partial no-shorting constraint in a regime switching market with random coefficients.</description>

      <title>Virtual Linking Bids for Market Clearing with Non-Merchant Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of energy market clearing, non-merchant assets are assets that do not submit bids but whose operational constraints are included.Integrating energy storage systems as non-merchant assets can maximize social welfare. However, the disconnection between market intervals poses challenges for market properties, and this has not been well-studied yet. We contribute to the literature on market-clearing with non-merchant storage by proposing a market-clearing procedure that preserves desirable market properties, even under uncertainty. This approach is based on a novel representation of storage systems in which the energy available is discretized to reflect the different prices at which the storage system was charged. These prices are included as virtual bids in subsequent market clearings, establishing a link between different market intervals. We show that market clearing with virtual linking bids has the advantage of guaranteeing cost recovery for market participants and can outperform traditional methods in terms of social welfare.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-Guaranteed Safety-Critical Control with Applications to Heterogeneous Platoons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00238v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies safety and feasibility guarantees for systems with tight control bounds. It has been shown that stabilizing an affine control system while optimizing a quadratic cost and satisfying state and control constraints can be mapped to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF). One of the main challenges in this method is that the QP could easily become infeasible under safety constraints of high relative degree, especially under tight control bounds. Recent work focused on deriving sufficient conditions for guaranteeing feasibility. The existing results are case-dependent. In this paper, we consider the general case. We define a feasibility constraint and propose a new type of CBF to enforce it. Our method guarantees the feasibility of the above mentioned QPs, while satisfying safety requirements. We demonstrate the proposed method on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem for a heterogeneous platoon with tight control bounds, and compare our method to existing CBF-CLF approaches. The results show that our proposed approach can generate gradually transitioned control (without abrupt changes) with guaranteed feasibility and safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of decentralized resource allocation in the presence of Byzantine attacks. Such attacks occur when an unknown number of malicious agents send random or carefully crafted messages to their neighbors, aiming to prevent the honest agents from reaching the optimal resource allocation strategy. We characterize these malicious behaviors with the classical Byzantine attacks model, and propose a class of Byzantine-resilient decentralized resource allocation algorithms augmented with dual-domain defenses. The honest agents receive messages containing the (possibly malicious) dual variables from their neighbors at each iteration, and filter these messages with robust aggregation rules. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed algorithms can converge to neighborhoods of the optimal resource allocation strategy, given that the robust aggregation rules are properly designed. Numerical experiments are conducted to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of finite-horizon control of a discrete-time linear system, where the initial state distribution follows a Gaussian mixture model, the terminal state must follow a specified Gaussian distribution, and the state and control inputs must obey chance constraints. We show that, throughout the time horizon, the state and control distributions are fully characterized by Gaussian mixtures. We then formulate the cost, distributional terminal constraint, and affine/2-norm chance constraints on the state and control, as convex functions of the decision variables. This is leveraged to formulate the chance-constrained path planning problem as a single convex optimization problem. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stability Properties of the Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator in 1-cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator (IGO) is a mathematical model of a hybrid closed-loop system. It arises by closing a special kind of continuous linear positive time-invariant system with impulsive feedback, which employs both amplitude and frequency pulse modulation. The structure of IGO precludes the existence of equilibria, and all its solutions are oscillatory. With its origin in mathematical biology, the IGO also presents a control paradigm useful in a wide range of applications, in particular dosing of chemicals and medicines. Since the pulse modulation feedback mechanism introduces significant nonlinearity and non-smoothness in the closedloop dynamics, conventional controller design methods fail to apply. However, the hybrid dynamics of IGO reduce to a nonlinear, time-invariant discrete-time system, exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence between periodic solutions of the original IGO and those of the discrete-time system. The paper proposes a design approach that leverages the linearization of the equivalent discrete-time dynamics in the vicinity of a fixed point. A simple and efficient local stability condition of the 1-cycle in terms of the characteristics of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions is obtained.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traveling Purchaser Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02476v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traveling purchaser problem (TPP) is an important combinatorial optimization problem with broad applications. Due to the coupling between routing and purchasing, existing works on TPPs commonly address route construction and purchase planning simultaneously, which, however, leads to exact methods with high computational cost and heuristics with sophisticated design but limited performance. In sharp contrast, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which addresses route construction and purchase planning separately, while evaluating and optimizing the solution from a global perspective. The key components of our approach include a bipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product relations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite graph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant benefit of our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the policy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing plan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, leveraging DRL, we can train the policy network to optimize the global solution objective. Furthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be trained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across instances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances that are never seen during training. Experiments on various synthetic TPP instances and the TPPLIB benchmark demonstrate that our DRL-based approach can significantly outperform well-established TPP heuristics, reducing the optimality gap by 40%-90%, and also showing an advantage in runtime, especially on large-sized instances.</description>

      <title>A structured L-BFGS method with diagonal scaling and its application to image registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise an L-BFGS method for optimization problems in which the objective is the sum of two functions, where the Hessian of the first function is computationally unavailable while the Hessian of the second function has a computationally available approximation that allows for cheap matrix-vector products. This is a prototypical setting for many inverse problems. The proposed L-BFGS method exploits the structure of the objective to construct a more accurate Hessian approximation than in standard L-BFGS. In contrast to existing works on structured L-BFGS, we choose the first part of the seed matrix, which approximates the Hessian of the first function, as a diagonal matrix rather than a multiple of the identity. We derive two suitable formulas for the coefficients of the diagonal matrix and show that this boosts performance on real-life image registration problems, which are highly non-convex inverse problems. The new method converges globally and linearly on non-convex problems under mild assumptions in a general Hilbert space setting, making it applicable to a broad class of inverse problems. An implementation of the method is freely available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many systems occurring in real-world applications, such as controlling the motions of robots or modeling the spread of diseases, are switched impulsive systems. To ensure that the system state stays in a safe region (e.g., to avoid collisions with obstacles), barrier functions are widely utilized. As the system dimension increases, deriving suitable barrier functions becomes extremely complex. Fortunately, many systems consist of multiple subsystems, such as different areas where the disease occurs. In this work, we present sufficient conditions for interconnected switched impulsive systems to maintain safety by constructing local barrier functions for the individual subsystems instead of a global one, allowing for much easier and more efficient derivation. To validate our results, we numerically demonstrate its effectiveness using an epidemiological model.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimally Stop Diffusion Processes, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimal stopping for diffusion processes with unknown model primitives within the continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) framework developed by Wang et al. (2020), and present applications to option pricing and portfolio choice. By penalizing the corresponding variational inequality formulation, we transform the stopping problem into a stochastic optimal control problem with two actions. We then randomize controls into Bernoulli distributions and add an entropy regularizer to encourage exploration. We derive a semi-analytical optimal Bernoulli distribution, based on which we devise RL algorithms using the martingale approach established in Jia and Zhou (2022a), and prove a policy improvement theorem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms in pricing finite-horizon American put options and in solving Merton's problem with transaction costs, and show that both the offline and online algorithms achieve high accuracy in learning the value functions and characterizing the associated free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Optimal Replenishment Strategy for Satellite Constellation with Dual Supply Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel inventory management model for the replenishment strategy of a satellite mega-constellation incorporating dual supply modes: normal and auxiliary. The proposed framework employs an indirect channel for normal supply, wherein spare satellites are initially injected into a parking orbit before transferring to the target orbital plane via propulsion systems and orbital perturbations. Conversely, the auxiliary supply mode utilizes a direct channel, injecting spare satellites immediately into their designated orbital planes. The inventory management model is constructed using parametric replenishment policies: $\left(s,Q\right)$ and $\left(R_1,R_2,Q_1,Q_2\right)$ with a time window. Following this model, two optimization problems are addressed to construct the supply chain for satellite mega-constellation replenishment and to evaluate its performance. These are decision-making contexts from the perspectives of constellation operators and launch service providers. The case study showcases the practical applicability of the proposed model and optimization problems, yielding valuable insights for stakeholders in the spaceborne industry.</description>

      <title>Contraction Theory for Nonlinear Stability Analysis and Learning-based Control: A Tutorial Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Iteration Complexity of Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in near-term applications of quantum computers, i.e., using quantum circuits that have short decoherence times due to hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQA), wherein an optimization algorithm implemented on a classical computer evaluates a parametrized quantum circuit as an objective function, are a leading framework in this space. An enormous breadth of algorithms in this framework have been proposed for solving a range of problems in machine learning, forecasting, applied physics, and combinatorial optimization, among others.
  In this paper, we analyze the iteration complexity of VQA, that is, the number of steps that VQA requires until its iterates satisfy a surrogate measure of optimality. We argue that although VQA procedures incorporate algorithms that can, in the idealized case, be modeled as classic procedures in the optimization literature, the particular nature of noise in near-term devices invalidates the claim of applicability of off-the-shelf analyses of these algorithms. Specifically, noise makes the evaluations of the objective function via quantum circuits biased. Commonly used optimization procedures, such as SPSA and the parameter shift rule, can thus be seen as derivative-free optimization algorithms with biased function evaluations, for which there are currently no iteration complexity guarantees in the literature. We derive the missing guarantees and find that the rate of convergence is unaffected. However, the level of bias contributes unfavorably to both the constant therein, and the asymptotic distance to stationarity, i.e., the more bias, the farther one is guaranteed, at best, to reach a stationary point of the VQA objective.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy in Deep Learning Using Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the applications of random matrix theory (RMT) in the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), focusing on layer pruning that is reducing the number of DNN parameters (weights). Our numerical results show that this pruning leads to a drastic reduction of parameters while not reducing the accuracy of DNNs and CNNs. Moreover, pruning the fully connected DNNs actually increases the accuracy and decreases the variance for random initializations. Our numerics indicate that this enhancement in accuracy is due to the simplification of the loss landscape. We next provide rigorous mathematical underpinning of these numerical results by proving the RMT-based Pruning Theorem. Our results offer valuable insights into the practical application of RMT for the creation of more efficient and accurate deep-learning models.</description>

      <title>Efficient representations of upper limits and confidence intervals for experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upper limits and confidence intervals are a convenient way to present experimental results. With modern experiments producing more and more data, it is often necessary to reduce the volume of the results for convenient distribution. A common approach is to take a maximum over a set of upper limits, which yields an upper limit valid for the entire set. This, however, can result in significant sensitivity loss, because we discard more constraining data. In this paper we introduce functional upper limits and confidence intervals that allow to summarize results with small relaxation of constraints. A toy example and an application to upper limits in all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches are worked out.</description>

      <title>Accurate, scalable, and efficient Bayesian optimal experimental design with derivative-informed neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14810v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider optimal experimental design (OED) problems in selecting the most informative observation sensors to estimate model parameters in a Bayesian framework. Such problems are computationally prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is expensive to evaluate, the parameters are high-dimensional, and the optimization for sensor selection is combinatorial and high-dimensional. To address these challenges, we develop an accurate, scalable, and efficient computational framework based on derivative-informed neural operators (DINO). We propose to use derivative-informed dimension reduction to reduce the parameter dimensions, based on which we train DINO with derivative information as an accurate and efficient surrogate for the PtO map and its derivative. Moreover, we derive DINO-enabled efficient formulations in computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point, the eigenvalues of approximate posterior covariance, and three commonly used optimality criteria for the OED problems. Furthermore, we provide detailed error analysis for the approximations of the MAP point, the eigenvalues, and the optimality criteria. We also propose a modified swapping greedy algorithm for the sensor selection optimization and demonstrate that the proposed computational framework is scalable to preserve the accuracy for increasing parameter dimensions and achieves high computational efficiency, with an over 1000$\times$ speedup accounting for both offline construction and online evaluation costs, compared to high-fidelity Bayesian OED solutions for a three-dimensional nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction example with tens of thousands of parameters.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the rate of convergence for singular perturbation problems for first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As an application we derive the rate of convergence for singularly perturbed two-players zero-sum deterministic differential games (i.e., leading to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations) and, subsequently, in case of singularly perturbed mean field games of acceleration. Namely, we show that in both the models the rate of convergence is $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>Private Heterogeneous Federated Learning Without a Trusted Server Revisited: Error-Optimal and Communication-Efficient Algorithms for Convex Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of federated learning (FL) with private data from people who do not trust the server or other silos/clients. In this context, every silo (e.g. hospital) has data from several people (e.g. patients) and needs to protect the privacy of each person's data (e.g. health records), even if the server and/or other silos try to uncover this data. Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP) prevents each silo's data from being leaked, by requiring that silo i's communications satisfy item-level differential privacy. Prior work arXiv:2106.09779 characterized the optimal excess risk bounds for ISRL-DP algorithms with homogeneous (i.i.d.) silo data and convex loss functions. However, two important questions were left open: (1) Can the same excess risk bounds be achieved with heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) silo data? (2) Can the optimal risk bounds be achieved with fewer communication rounds? In this paper, we give positive answers to both questions. We provide novel ISRL-DP FL algorithms that achieve the optimal excess risk bounds in the presence of heterogeneous silo data. Moreover, our algorithms are more communication-efficient than the prior state-of-the-art. For smooth loss functions, our algorithm achieves the optimal excess risk bound and has communication complexity that matches the non-private lower bound. Additionally, our algorithms are more computationally efficient than the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting unknown targets from data. We propose Online Residual Learning (ORL), a method that combines online adaptation with offline-trained predictions. At a lower level, we employ multiple offline predictions generated before or at the beginning of the prediction horizon. We augment every offline prediction by learning their respective residual error concerning the true target state online, using the recursive least squares algorithm. At a higher level, we treat the augmented lower-level predictors as experts, adopting the Prediction with Expert Advice framework. We utilize an adaptive softmax weighting scheme to form an aggregate prediction and provide guarantees for ORL in terms of regret. We employ ORL to boost performance in the setting of online pedestrian trajectory prediction. Based on data from the Stanford Drone Dataset, we show that ORL can demonstrate best-of-both-worlds performance.</description>
