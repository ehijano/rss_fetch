      <title>Reduced Cloud Cover Errors in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model Through Equation Discovery And Automatic Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate models rely on parameterizations that account for the effects of small-scale processes on large-scale dynamics. Particularly cloud-related parameterizations remain a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. While hybrid Earth system models (ESMs) with machine learning-based parameterizations could improve current ESMs, deep learning approaches often lack interpretability, physical consistency, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, most data-driven parameterizations are trained in a stand-alone fashion and fail within ESMs, partly due to the difficulty of tuning the ESM to accommodate new, non-traditional schemes. In this study, we introduce a novel two-step pipeline for improving a climate model with data-driven parameterizations. First, we incorporate a physically consistent, data-driven cloud cover parameterization into the ICON global atmospheric model. The parameterization, a diagnostic equation derived from storm-resolving simulations via symbolic regression, retains the interpretability and efficiency of traditional parameterizations while improving fidelity. Second, we introduce an automated, gradient-free tuning procedure to recalibrate the new climate model with Earth observations. We employ the Nelder-Mead algorithm and progressively increase simulation length, making our approach simple, computationally efficient, and easily extendable to other ESMs. The tuned hybrid model significantly reduces some long-standing biases in cloud cover and radiative budgets, particularly over regions such as the Southern Ocean and the subtropical stratocumulus regions. Moreover, it remains robust under +4K surface warming. Our results highlight the potential of data-driven parameterizations when combined with model tuning. This framework offers an automatic, efficient and practical approach to enhancing climate projections without losing performance or interpretability.</description>

      <title>On the sensitivity of different ensemble filters to the type of assimilated observation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in data assimilation (DA) have focused on developing more flexible approaches that can better accommodate nonlinearities in models and observations. However, it remains unclear how the performance of these advanced methods depends on the observation network characteristics. In this study, we present initial experiments with the surface quasi-geostrophic model, in which we compare a recently developed AI-based ensemble filter with the standard Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). Our results show that the analysis solutions respond differently to the number, spatial distribution, and nonlinear fraction of assimilated observations. We also find notable changes in the multiscale characteristics of the analysis errors. Given that standard DA techniques will be eventually replaced by more advanced methods, we hope this study sets the ground for future efforts to reassess the value of Earth observation systems in the context of newly emerging algorithms.</description>

      <title>Regularized Fingerprinting with Linearly Optimal Weight Matrix in Detection and Attribution of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change detection and attribution plays a central role in establishing the causal influence of human activities on global warming. The most widely used framework, optimal fingerprinting, is a linear regression model with errors-in-variables (EIV), in which each covariate is subject to measurement error whose covariance matrix is the same as that of the regression error up to a known scale. The reliability of such detection and attribution analyses critically depends on accurate inference of the regression coefficients. The optimal weight matrix in estimating the regression coefficient is the precision matrix of the regression error, which is typically unknown and has to be estimated from climate model simulations with appropriate regularization. However, the estimators from the prevailing method, regularized optimal fingerprinting, are not optimal as believed, owing to the unreliable estimation of the optimal weight matrix, and their uncertainties are underestimated, leading to too narrow confidence intervals to match the nominal confidence levels. In this paper, we propose consistent estimates of the variances of regression coefficients for weight matrices within the class of linear shrinkage estimators. Building on this result, we derive a linearly optimal weight matrix that directly minimizes the asymptotic variances of the estimated scaling factors within the fingerprinting framework. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed method yields confidence intervals with empirical coverage rates close to the nominal level, while also achieving shorter average interval lengths. In applications to the detection and attribution analyses of annual mean near-surface air temperature at the global, continental, and subcontinental scales during 1951--2020, the proposed method produced shorter confidence intervals than the existing approaches in most of the analyses.</description>

      <title>Supporting renewable energy planning and operation with data-driven high-resolution ensemble weather forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planning and operation of renewable energy, especially wind power, depend crucially on accurate, timely, and high-resolution weather information. Coarse-grid global numerical weather forecasts are typically downscaled to meet these requirements, introducing challenges of scale inconsistency, process representation error, computation cost, and entanglement of distinct uncertainty sources from chaoticity, model bias, and large-scale forcing. We address these challenges by learning the climatological distribution of a target wind farm using its high-resolution numerical weather simulations. An optimal combination of this learned high-resolution climatological prior with coarse-grid large scale forecasts yields highly accurate, fine-grained, full-variable, large ensemble of weather pattern forecasts. Using observed meteorological records and wind turbine power outputs as references, the proposed methodology verifies advantageously compared to existing numerical/statistical forecasting-downscaling pipelines, regarding either deterministic/probabilistic skills or economic gains. Moreover, a 100-member, 10-day forecast with spatial resolution of 1 km and output frequency of 15 min takes &lt; 1 hour on a moderate-end GPU, as contrast to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ CPU hours for conventional numerical simulation. By drastically reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy, our method paves the way for more efficient and reliable renewable energy planning and operation.</description>

      <title>Simulating Nighttime Visible Satellite Imagery of Tropical Cyclones Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible (VIS) imagery is important for monitoring Tropical Cyclones (TCs) but is unavailable at night. This study presents a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model to generate nighttime VIS imagery with significantly enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution. Our method offers three key improvements compared to existing models. First, we replaced the L1 loss in the pix2pix framework with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, which significantly reduced image blurriness. Second, we selected multispectral infrared (IR) bands as input based on a thorough examination of their spectral properties, providing essential physical information for accurate simulation. Third, we incorporated the direction parameters of the sun and the satellite, which addressed the dependence of VIS images on sunlight directions and enabled a much larger training set from continuous daytime data. The model was trained and validated using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime, achieving statistical results of SSIM = 0.923 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.0299, which significantly surpasses existing models. We also performed a cross-satellite nighttime model validation using the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which yields outstanding results compared to existing models. Our model is operationally applied to generate accurate VIS imagery with arbitrary virtual sunlight directions, significantly contributing to the nighttime monitoring of various meteorological phenomena.</description>

Abstract: I describe in this paper how the shallow water waves of Airy, produced by submarine earthquake, gentle on a deep open sea traveling by the cruising speed, get instantaneous $ +\infty$ or $-\infty$ traveling speed in approaching the shallow water near the coasts at the points of the surface on x=X, near the crest or the trough, where the tangent of itself and the tangent of the seabed coincide, rushing as inland tunamis ( near the crest) or as offshore tunamis (near the trough).</description>
