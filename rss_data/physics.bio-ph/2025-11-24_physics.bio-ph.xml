      <title>Humidity lightens the air but hinders human evaporative cooling in arid heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overheating poses significant threats to human health and productivity. In hot conditions, the human body primarily cools through sweat evaporation; however, we show that understanding of physical phenomena controlling the evaporation rate is surprisingly incomplete. This rate is equal to the product of the skin to air water vapor concentration difference and the flow dependent mass transfer coefficient, which, according to the Lewis heat and mass transfer analogy, is proportional to the convective heat transfer coefficient. In low wind, free convection conditions, current models for the human heat transfer coefficients consider only temperature driven air buoyancy. Here, we show that in arid heat, humidity from sweat exerts a comparable but opposing buoyant effect. Using sweating thermal manikin experiments and digital twin multiphysics simulations, we demonstrate that the dueling thermal and humidity induced buoyancy can severely suppress sweat evaporation (e.g., by over half in conditions that occur in Arizona for one-third of the year). Neglecting humidity-induced buoyancy leads to substantial errors in thermoregulation model predictions; within 2 hour exposure to typical arid heat conditions, core temperature increases by 1C more than predicted by legacy calculations. We provide compact, physics informed models for free convective heat transfer coefficients for wide temperature and humidity ranges, enabling improved thermoregulation modeling and thermal audits for more accurate heat stress assessment and optimization of extreme heat mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Jump Approach for Photosynthetic Energy Transfer with Chemical Reaction and Fluorescence Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.</description>

      <title>Physical interactions enable energy-efficient Turing patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patterns are ubiquitous in nature, but how they form is often unclear. Turing developed a seminal theory to explain patterns based on reactions that counteract the equalizing tendency of diffusion. These reactions require continuous energy input since the system otherwise would proceed to equilibrium, but what systems are energy-efficient is currently unclear. To address this question, we introduce a thermodynamically-consistent model of a Turing system. We reveal that repulsive interactions between the stereotypical activator and inhibitor reduce energy requirements significantly. Interestingly, efficient patterns occur for weak activity, albeit at reduced amplitude. Our results suggest that physical interactions might be central in forming natural patterns.</description>

      <title>Neural optimization of the most probable paths of 3D active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational neural-network framework to determine the most probable path (MPP) of a 3D active Brownian particle (ABP) by directly minimizing the Onsager-Machlup integral (OMI). To obtain the OMI, we use the Onsager-Machlup variational principle for active systems and construct the Rayleighian of the ABP by including its active power. This approach reveals geometric transitions of the MPP from in-plane I- and U-shaped paths to 3D helical paths as the final time and net displacement are varied. We also demonstrate that the initial and final boundary conditions have a significant impact on the MPPs. Our results show that neural optimization combined with the Onsager-Machlup variational principle provides an efficient and versatile framework for exploring optimal transition pathways in active and nonequilibrium systems.</description>
