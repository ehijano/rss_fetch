      <title>Noncommutative spaces as quantized constrained Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the strong-field limit of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field as a toy model for general covariant systems, establishing a novel connection between constrained Hamiltonian dynamics and noncommutative geometry. Starting from the action $S=\int d\tau \, \dot{x}^i A_i(x)$, which represents the holonomy of the particle's path with respect to the electromagnetic potential $A_i$, we analyze the resulting general covariant system with vanishing Hamiltonian. The equations of motion $F_{ij}\dot{x}^j=0$ confine the particle to leaves of a singular foliation defined by the field strength tensor $F_{ij}=\partial_i A_j -\partial_j A_i$. We show that the physical state space corresponds to the space of leaves of this foliation, with points connected by field lines being gauge equivalent. The Hamiltonian analysis reveals constraints $\kappa_i=p_i-A_i$ that are locally classified as first-class or second-class depending on the rank of the field strength tensor. Upon quantization, this leads to noncommuting coordinate operators, establishing the physical state space as a noncommutative geometry. We provide explicit examples and show in particular that the magnetic monopole field strength yields a fuzzy sphere.</description>

      <title>Mixed-mode loading of a straight crack with surface strain-gradient elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work models brittle fracture using a linearized surface-substrate theory in which the crack faces possess surface stresses derived from a surface strain-gradient elastic energy. The model incorporates surface stretching, curvature, and surface gradients of stretching into the surface energy, thereby capturing small-length-scale effects absent from earlier surface elasticity formulations. The theory, supplemented with physically motivated tip conditions, is applied to the mixed mode-I/mode-II loading of a finite straight crack in an infinite isotropic plate. Using complex-analytic techniques, it is shown that the resulting stress and strain fields remain bounded up to the crack tips for nearly all admissible parameter values. Combined with previous results for mode-III loading, the analysis demonstrates that linearized surface-substrate models incorporating surface strain-gradient elasticity eliminate crack-tip singularities across all principal modes of far-field loading.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Heat Flux Method for Simple and Accurate Neumann Thermal Boundary Imposition in the Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Material Point Method (MPM), accurately imposing Neumann-type thermal boundary conditions, particularly convective heat flux boundaries, remains a significant challenge due to the inherent nonconformity between complex evolving material boundaries and the fixed background grid. This paper introduces a novel Virtual Heat Flux Method (VHFM) to overcome this limitation. The core idea is to construct a virtual flux field on an auxiliary domain surrounding the physical boundary, which exactly satisfies the prescribed boundary condition. This transforms the surface integral in the weak form into an equivalent, and easily computed, volumetric integral. Consequently, VHFM eliminates the need for explicit boundary tracking, specialized boundary particles, or complex surface reconstruction. A unified formulation is presented, demonstrating the method's straightforward extension to general scalar, vector, and tensor Neumann conditions. The accuracy, robustness, and convergence of VHFM are rigorously validated through a series of numerical benchmarks, including 1D transient analysis, 2D and 3D curved boundaries, and problems with large rotations and complex moving geometries. The results show that VHFM achieves accuracy comparable to conforming node-based imposition and significantly outperforms conventional particle-based approaches. Its simplicity, computational efficiency, and robustness make it an attractive solution for integrating accurate thermal boundary conditions into thermo-mechanical and other multiphysics MPM frameworks.</description>

      <title>A high order accurate and provably stable fully discrete continuous Galerkin framework on summation-by-parts form for advection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order accurate fully discrete numerical scheme for solving Initial Boundary Value Problems (IBVPs) within the Continuous Galerkin (CG)-based Finite Element framework. Both the spatial and time approximation in Summation-By-Parts (SBP) form are considered here. The initial and boundary conditions are imposed weakly using the Simultaneous Approximation Term (SAT) technique. The resulting SBP-SAT formulation yields an energy estimate in terms of the initial and external boundary data, leading to an energy-stable discretization in both space and time. The proposed method is evaluated numerically using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). The scheme achieves super-convergence in both spatial and temporal direction with accuracy $\mathcal{O}(p+2)$ for $p\geq 2$, where $p$ refers to the degree of the Lagrange basis. In an application case, we show that the fully discrete formulation efficiently captures space-time variations even on coarse meshes, demonstrating the method's computational effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Foundations and Fundamental Properties of a Two-Parameter Memory-Weighted Velocity Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems whose present state depends on their history often requires generalizations of the classical concept of a derivative. This work introduces a **memory-weighted velocity operator** \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}\) designed to quantify rates of change while incorporating time-varying, power-law memory. The operator is defined via a kernel with two independent, continuous memory exponents \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\beta(t)\), which separately weight the influence of past state increments and the scaling of elapsed time. For a function \(x\), the resulting quantity \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) represents its memory-weighted rate of change. We establish fundamental properties of this operator, including its explicit integral representation, linearity, and a key result on the **continuous dependence** of \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) on the exponents \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) with respect to uniform convergence. Furthermore, we examine the special **uniform-memory** case \(\alpha=\beta\equiv1\), proving that \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x](t)\) **asymptotically recovers** the classical derivative \(\dot{x}(0)\) as \(t \to 0^{+}\), thereby ensuring consistency with standard calculus. The analysis is supported by self-contained appendices providing necessary technical tools. The framework developed here offers a well-defined mathematical object for describing memory-dependent dynamics, with potential utility in formulating and analyzing evolution equations that feature adaptively weighted historical information.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Averages of Plancherel Random Partitions: Elliptic Functions, Phase Transitions, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random integer partitions~$\lambda$ that follow the Poissonized Plancherel measure of parameter~$t^2$. Using Riemann--Hilbert techniques, we establish the asymptotics of the multiplicative averages \[ Q(t,s)=\mathbb{E} \left[ \prod_{i\geq 1} \left(1+\e^{\eta(\lambda_i-i+\frac{1}{2}-s)}\right)^{-1} \right] \] for fixed $\eta&gt;0$ in the regime $t\to+\infty$ and $s/t=O(1)$. We compute the large-$t$ expansion of $\log Q(t,xt)$ expressing the rate function $\mathcal{F}(x) = -\lim_{t \to \infty}t^{-2}\log Q(t,xt)$ and the subsequent divergent and oscillatory contributions explicitly in terms of elliptic theta functions. The associated equilibrium measure presents, in general, nontrivial saturated regions and it undergoes two third-order phase transitions of different nature which we describe. Applications of our results include an explicit characterization of tail probabilities of the height function of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth model and of the edge of the positive-temperature discrete Bessel process and asymptotics of radially symmetric solutions to the 2D~Toda equation with step-like shock initial data.</description>

      <title>Gauging Open EFTs from the top down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17089v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\"uckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for St\"uckelberg/Goldstone fields.</description>

      <title>Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Direct and Indirect Loop Equations in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson loops is governed by an infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations and trace relations. In the context of the lattice positivity bootstrap, a central challenge is determining a dynamically independent basis of these operators within a truncated space. We present a systematic framework to solve this problem, utilizing a geometric plaquette-cut and subloop-cut strategy to efficiently generate all (local) direct equations. Furthermore, we identify and analyze ``indirect equations", which arise from the elimination of higher-length intermediate loops. We elucidate the origin of these subtle relations and propose a vertex-filtering strategy to construct them. Applying the above framework to SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory, we provide explicit counting of independent canonical loops and equations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, along with a statistical analysis of their asymptotic growth.</description>

      <title>Hodge Decomposition Guides the Optimization of Synchronization over Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in synchronization dynamics over "higher-order" network models, optimization theory for such systems is limited. Here, we study a family of Kuramoto models inspired by algebraic topology in which oscillators are coupled over simplicial complexes (SCs) using their associated Hodge Laplacian matrices. We optimize such systems by extending the synchrony alignment function -- an optimization framework for synchronizing graph-coupled heterogeneous oscillators. Computational experiments are given to illustrate how this approach can effectively solve a variety of combinatorial problems including the joint optimization of projected synchronization dynamics onto lower- and upper-dimensional simplices within SCs. We also investigate the role of SC homology and develop bifurcation theory to characterize the extent to which optimal solutions are contained within (or spread across) the three Hodge subspaces. Our work extends optimization theory to the setting of higher-order networks, provides practical algorithms for Hodge-Laplacian-related dynamics including (but not limited to) Kuramoto oscillators, and paves the way for an emerging field that interfaces algebraic topology, combinatorial optimization, and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.</description>

      <title>Five Parameter Hypergeometric 3F2(1) when One or more Parameters are Integers or Separated by Integers: Derivations, Review, Exotics and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work was intended to be all about, and only about, hypergeometric 3F2(1). The initial goal was to revisit many identities from the literature that have been derived over the years and show that they can be obtained in a simpler way armed, with only a minimum of elementary identities. That goal has been achieved as a (patient) reader will discover. In another sense, this work is a partial review of the last half-century's worth of progress in the evaluation of a particular set of 3F2(1), in particular those cases where at least one parameter is an integer or two or more parameters are separated by an integer. The result is a collection of very general identities (or techniques) that an analyst seeking to evaluate a particular 3F2(1), might want to consider as a starting point. That is the secondary goal.
  Along the way however, the temptation arose to investigate at least one of the unanswered questions that others have raised. This led to a few digressions, and some possibly new results. The reader is invited to follow where curiosity led me to depart from a straightforward review of the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Neumann series of Bessel functions for the solutions of the Sturm-Liouville equation in impedance form and related boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions representation for solutions of the Sturm--Liouville equation in impedance form \[ (\kappa(x)u')' + \lambda \kappa(x)u = 0,\quad 0 &lt; x &lt; L, \] in the case where $\kappa \in W^{1,2}(0,L)$ and has no zeros on the interval of interest. The $x$-dependent coefficients of this representation can be constructed explicitly by means of a simple recursive integration procedure. Moreover, we derive bounds for the truncation error, which are uniform whenever the spectral parameter $\rho=\sqrt{\lambda}$ satisfies a condition of the form $|\operatorname{Im}\rho|\leq C$. Based on these representations, we develop a numerical method for solving spectral problems that enables the computation of eigenvalues with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hardy decomposition of first order Lipschitz functions by Lam\'e-Navier solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clifford algebra language allows us to rewrite the Lam\'e-Navier system in terms of the Euclidean Dirac operator. In this paper, the main question we shall be concerned with is whether or not a higher order Lipschitz function on the boundary $\Gamma$ of a Jordan domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ can be decomposed into a sum of the two boundary values of a solution of the Lam\'e-Navier system with jump across $\Gamma$. Our main tool are the Hardy projections related to a singular integral operator arising in the context of Clifford analysis, which turns out to be an involution operator on the first order Lipschitz classes.</description>

      <title>The pinned half-space Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half-space models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class exhibit rich boundary phenomena that alter the asymptotic behavior familiar from their full-space counterparts. A distinguishing feature of these systems is the presence of a boundary parameter that governs a transition between subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes, characterized by different scaling exponents and fluctuation statistics.
  In this paper we construct the pinned half-space Airy line ensemble $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ on $[0,\infty)$ -- a natural half-space analogue of the Airy line ensemble -- expected to arise as the universal scaling limit of supercritical half-space KPZ models. The ensemble $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ is obtained as the weak limit of the critical half-space Airy line ensembles $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \varpi}$ introduced in arXiv:2505.01798 as the boundary parameter $\varpi$ tends to infinity.
  We show that $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ has a Pfaffian point process structure with an explicit correlation kernel and that, after a parabolic shift, it satisfies a one-sided Brownian Gibbs property described by pairwise pinned Brownian motions. Far from the origin, $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ converges to the standard Airy line ensemble, while at the origin its distribution coincides with that of the ordered eigenvalues (with doubled multiplicity) of the stochastic Airy operator with $\beta = 4$.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN): A Quantum Information Theoretic Framework for Modeling Musical Context and Polyphony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) summarize musical context into a deterministic hidden state vector, imposing an information bottleneck that fails to capture the inherent ambiguity in music. We propose the Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN), a novel theoretical architecture utilizing the Density Matrix. This allows the model to maintain a statistical ensemble of musical interpretations (a mixed state), capturing both classical probabilities and quantum coherences. We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction. We introduce an analytical framework using Von Neumann Entropy to quantify musical uncertainty and Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to measure entanglement between voices. The DM-RNN provides a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling complex, ambiguous musical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximate analytical bound states with a linear combination of two diatomic molecule potentials, Yukawa and four parameters potentials, within the framework of the path integral formalism. With the help of an appropriate approximation to evaluate the centrifugal term, the energy spectrum and the normalized wave functions of the bound states are derived from the poles of Green's function and its residues. The partition function and other thermodynamic properties were obtained using the compact form of the energy equation.</description>

      <title>Chaotic resetting: A resetting strategy for deterministic chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restarting a stochastic search process can accelerate its completion by providing an opportunity to take a more favorable path with each reset. This strategy, known as stochastic resetting, is well studied in random processes. Here, we introduce chaotic resetting, a fundamentally different resetting strategy designed for deterministic chaotic systems. Unlike stochastic resetting, where randomness is intrinsic to the dynamics, chaotic resetting exploits the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent to chaotic motion: unavoidable uncertainties in the reset conditions effectively generate new realizations of the deterministic process. This extension is nontrivial because some realizations may significantly speed up the search, while others may significantly slow it down. We study the conditions required for chaotic resetting to be consistently advantageous, concluding that it requires the presence of a mixed phase space in which fractal and smooth regions coexist. We quantify its effectiveness by demonstrating substantial reductions in average search times when an optimal resetting interval is used. These results establish a clear conceptual bridge between deterministic chaos and search optimization, opening new avenues for accelerating processes in real-world chaotic systems where perfect control or knowledge of initial conditions is unattainable.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Brownian loop soup clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Brownian loop soup clusters in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for an arbitrary intensity $\alpha&gt;0$. We show the existence of a phase transition for the presence of unbounded clusters and study its basic properties. In particular, we show that, when $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, almost surely all the loops are connected into a single cluster. Such a phenomenon is not observed in discrete percolation-type models. In addition, we prove the existence of a one-arm exponent and compare the clusters with the finite-range system obtained by imposing lower and upper bounds on the diameter of the loops.
  Finally, we provide a toolbox concerning the Brownian loop measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 3$. In particular, we derive decomposition formulas by rerooting the loops in specific ways and show that the loop measure is conformally invariant, generalising results of [Lup18] in dimension 1 and [LW04] in dimension 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present an intuitive construction of the quantum logical axiomatic system provided by George Mackey. The goal of this work is a detailed discussion of the results from the paper 'Physical justification for using the tensor product to describe two quantum systems as one joint system' [1] published by Diederik Aerts and Ingrid Daubechies. This means that we want to show how certain composed physical systems from classical and quantum mechanics should be described logically. To reach this goal, we will, like in [1], discuss a special class of axiomatically defined composed physical systems. With the help of certain results from lattice and c-morphism theory (see [2] and [23]), we will present a detailed proof of the statement, that in the quantum mechanical case, a composed physical system must be described via a tensor product space.</description>

      <title>A classification of coadjoint orbits carrying Gibbs ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coadjoint orbit $O_\lambda \subseteq {\mathfrak g}^*$ of a Lie group $G$ is said to carry a Gibbs ensemble if the set of all $x \in {\mathfrak g}$, for which the function
  $\alpha \mapsto e^{-\alpha(x)}$ on the orbit is integrable with respect to the
  Liouville measure, has non-empty interior $\Omega_\lambda$.
  We describe a classification of all coadjoint orbits of finite-dimensional
  Lie algebras with this property. In the context of Souriau's
  Lie group thermodynamics, the subset $\Omega_\lambda$
  is the geometric temperature, a parameter space for a family
  of Gibbs measures on the coadjoint orbit. The
  corresponding Fenchel--Legendre transform maps
  $\Omega_\lambda/{\mathfrak z}({\mathfrak g})$ diffeomorphically
  onto the interior of the convex hull of the coadjoint orbit
  $O_\lambda$. This provides an interesting perspective on the
  underlying information geometry.
  We also show that already
  the integrability of $e^{-\alpha(x)}$ for one $x \in {\mathfrak g}$ implies
  that $\Omega_\lambda \not=\emptyset$ and that, for general Hamiltonian
  actions, the existence of Gibbs measures implies that the range
  of the momentum maps consists of coadjoint orbits $O_\lambda$ as above.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and asymptotic limits for Langevin interacting systems with singular forces and multiplicative noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study systems of $N$ interacting particles described by the classical and relativistic Langevin dynamics with singular forces and multiplicative noises. For the classical model, we prove the ergodicity, obtaining an exponential rate of convergence to the invariant Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, and the small-mass limit, recovering the $N$-particle interacting overdamped Langevin dynamics. For the relativistic model, we establish the ergodicity, obtaining an algebraic mixing rate of any order to the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution, and the Newtonian limit (that is when the speed of light tends to infinity), approximating a system of underdamped Langevin dynamics. The proofs rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions that account for irregular potentials and multiplicative noises.</description>

      <title>Extended Heun Hierarchy in Quantum Seiberg-Witten Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.</description>

      <title>Cat states and violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cat state localized in the right Rindler wedge is employed to study the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar free Quantum Field Theory. By means of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, it turns out that the Bell-CHSH correlator can be evaluated in closed analytic form in terms of the imaginary error function. Being the superposition of two coherent states, cat states allow for the existence of interference terms which give rise to a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. As such, the present setup can be considered as an explicit realization of the results obtained by Summers-Werner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard definition of integration of differential forms is based on local coordinates and partitions of unity. This definition is mostly a formality and not used used in explicit computations or approximation schemes. We present a definition of the integral that uses triangulations instead. Our definition is a coordinate-free version of the standard definition of the Riemann integral on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and we argue that it is the natural definition in the contexts of Lie algebroids, stochastic integration and quantum field theory, where path integrals are defined using lattices. In particular, our definition naturally incorporates the different stochastic integrals, which involve integration over H\"{o}lder continuous paths. Furthermore, our definition is well-adapted to establishing integral identities from their combinatorial counterparts. Our construction is based on the observation that, in great generality, the things that are integrated are determined by cochains on the pair groupoid. Abstractly, our definition uses the van Est map to lift a differential form to the pair groupoid. Our construction suggests a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus which we prove: the singular cohomology and de Rham cohomology cap products of a cocycle with the fundamental class are equal.</description>

Abstract: A novel spin-extended so($d+1$,1) algebra is introduced and shown to provide an interesting framework for discussing the properties of a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with spin 1/2 and so($d+1$) symmetry. With some $d+2$ additional operators, spanning a basis of an so($d+1$,1) irreducible representation, the so($d+1$,1) generators provide a very easy way for deriving the integrals of motion of the matrix Hamiltonian in Sturm representation. Such integrals of motion are then transformed into those of the matrix Hamiltonian in Schr\"odinger representation, including a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector with spin. This leads to a derivation of the latter, as well as its properties in a more extended algebraic framework.</description>

      <title>In search of constitutive conditions in isotropic hyperelasticity: polyconvexity versus true-stress-true-strain monotonicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polyconvexity of a strain-energy function is nowadays increasingly presented as the ultimate material stability condition for an idealized elastic response. While the mathematical merits of polyconvexity are clearly understood, its mechanical consequences have received less attention. In this contribution we contrast polyconvexity with the recently rediscovered true-stress-true-strain monotonicity (TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$) condition. By way of explicit examples, we show that neither condition by itself is strong enough to guarantee physically reasonable behavior for ideal isotropic elasticity. In particular, polyconvexity does not imply a monotone trajectory of the Cauchy stress in unconstrained uniaxial extension which TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ ensures. On the other hand, TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ does not impose a monotone Cauchy shear stress response in simple shear which is enforced by Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity and in turn polyconvexity. Both scenarios are proven through the construction of appropriate strain-energy functions. Consequently, a combination of polyconvexity, ensuring Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity, and TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ seems to be a viable solution to Truesdell's Hauptproblem. However, so far no isotropic strain-energy function has been identified that satisfies both constraints globally at the same time. Although we are unable to deliver a valid solution here, we provide several results that could prove helpful in the construction of such an exceptional strain-energy function.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by a Right-Angle Penetrable Wedge: Closed-Form Solution for $\nu=\sqrt{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional time-harmonic transmission problem for an impedance-matched (rho=1) right-angle penetrable wedge at refractive index ratio nu=sqrt(2), in the integrable lemniscatic configuration (theta_w,nu,rho)=(pi/4,sqrt(2),1). Starting from Sommerfeld spectral representations, the transmission conditions on the two wedge faces yield a closed spectral functional system for the Sommerfeld transforms Q(zeta) and S(zeta). In this special configuration the associated Snell surface is the lemniscatic curve Y^2=2(t^4+1), uniformized by the square Weierstrass lattice tau=i. We solve the resulting orbit Wiener-Hopf/Riemann-Hilbert system on the torus and obtain an exact closed-form expression for the scattered transform Q_scat as a finite Weierstrass-zeta sum plus an explicitly constructed pole-free elliptic remainder. All pole coefficients are computed algebraically from the forcing pole set, and the construction enforces analyticity at the incident spectral point. We also reconstruct the face transform S and, under standard analyticity and growth hypotheses on the Sommerfeld densities, verify the transmission conditions on both wedge faces, the Sommerfeld radiation condition, and the Meixner edge condition. Finally, by steepest descent of the Sommerfeld integral we extract the far-field diffraction coefficient. The result is restricted to this integrable lemniscatic case; the general penetrable wedge remains challenging.</description>

Abstract: The papers [3,1,4,10] constructed an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin disks, and proved it satisfies mirror symmetry and relations with integrable hierarchies. That theory considered only disks with a single boundary state. In this work, we initiate the study of more general $r$-spin surfaces. We define graded $r$-spin surfaces with multiple internal and boundary states, together with their moduli spaces.
  In genus zero, the disk case, we define the associated open Witten bundle and prove that it is canonically oriented relative to the moduli space. We also describe a gluing construction for moduli spaces along boundaries, show that it lifts to the Witten bundle and relative cotangent line bundles, and that the result remains canonically relatively oriented.
  We then study the genus-one cylinder case. Here foundational difficulties arise because the Witten "bundle" is no longer an orbifold vector bundle. We resolve this by removing strata with incorrect fibre dimension, obtaining an orbibundle on the complement. The gluing method extends to genus one, and we prove that the Witten bundle again admits a canonical relative orientation.
  In the sequel [20], we construct a family of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ intersection theories in genus-zero indexed by $\mathfrak h\in\{0,\ldots,\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1\}$, where the $\mathfrak h$-th theory has $\mathfrak h+1$ boundary states, and compute their intersection numbers. The case $\mathfrak h=0$ recovers the theory of [3,1].
  In the sequel [21], restricting to the $\mathfrak h=0$ case, we construct an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin cylinders and show that its potential yields, after a change of variables, the genus-one part of the $r$th Gelfand-Dikii wave function, proving the genus-one case of the main conjecture of [4].</description>

      <title>Presymplectic BV-AKSZ for $N=1$, $D=4$ Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach to supersymmetric systems. In particular, we construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra which, as we demonstrate, admits an invariant presymplectic structure of degree $3$. This data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system, including a concise form of the BV master action. The important feature of (presymplectic) AKSZ models is that, at least at the level of equations of motion, they can be equivalently reformulated in the spacetime obtained by adding or eliminating contractible dimensions. For instance, the presymplectic AKSZ formulation of gravity can be lifted to the respective ``group manifold'', endowing it with the structure of a principle bundle and the Cartan connection therein, at least locally. In particular, the so-called rheonomy conditions emerge as a part of the presymplectic AKSZ equations of motion. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace. We also study general presymplectic BV-AKSZ models related by adding or removing contractible spacetime dimensions in order to systematically relate the spacetime and superspace formulations of the same system within the AKSZ-like framework. These relations are then illustrated using the supersymmetric particle as a toy model.</description>

Abstract: Hirota's discrete KdV equation is a well-known integrable two-dimensional partial difference equation regarded as a discrete analogue of the KdV equation. In this paper, we show that a variation of Hirota's discrete KdV equation with an additional parameter admits two types of exact solutions: discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions and periodic solutions described by Painlev\'e-type ordinary difference equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of infinite line ensembles on $[0, \infty)$ that are natural half-space analogues of the Airy line ensemble. Away from the origin these ensembles are locally described by avoiding Brownian bridges, and near the origin they are described by a sequence of avoiding reverse Brownian motions with alternating drifts, that depend on the parameter of the model. In addition, the restrictions of our ensembles to finitely many vertical lines form Pfaffian point processes with the crossover kernels obtained by Baik-Barraquand-Corwin-Suidan (Ann. Probab., 46(6), 3015-3089, 2018)</description>

      <title>Erasure cost of a quantum process: A thermodynamic meaning of the dynamical min-entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and information processing. We investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics -- that is, the minimal thermodynamic work cost to erase the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. The dynamical min-entropy can take positive and negative values, depending on the underlying quantum dynamics. The negative value of the erasure cost implies that the extraction of thermodynamic work is possible instead of its consumption during the process. A key foundation of this result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>A supergroup series for knot complements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three variable series invariant $F_K (y,z,q)$ for plumbed knot complements associated with a Lie superalgebra $sl(2|1)$. The invariant is a generalization of the $sl(2|1)$-series invariant $\hat{Z}(q)$ for closed 3-manifolds introduced by Ferrari and Putrov and an extension of the two variable series invariant defined by Gukov and Manolescu (GM) to the Lie superalgebra. We derive a surgery formula relating $F_K (y,z,q)$ to $\hat{Z}(q)$ invariant. We find appropriate expansion chambers for certain infinite families of torus knots and compute explicit examples. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a non semisimple $Spin^c$ decorated TQFT from the three variable series. We observe that the super $F_K (y,z,q)$ itself and its results exhibit distinctive features compared to the GM series.</description>

      <title>Symmetric orthogonalization and probabilistic weights in resource quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming non-orthogonal bases into orthogonal ones often compromises essential properties or physical meaning in quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate that L\"owdin symmetric orthogonalization (LSO) outperforms the widely used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) in characterizing and quantifying quantum resources, with particular emphasis on coherence and superposition. We employ LSO both to construct an orthogonal basis from a non-orthogonal one and to obtain a non-orthogonal basis from an orthogonal set, thereby mitigating ambiguity related to the basis choice in defining quantum coherence. Unlike GSO, which depends on the ordering of input states, LSO applies a symmetric transformation that treats all vectors equally and minimizes deviation from the original basis. This procedure yields basis sets with enhanced stability, preserving the closest possible correspondence to the original physical states while satisfying orthogonality. Building on LSO, we also introduce L\"owdin weights -- probabilistic weights for non-orthogonal representations that provide a consistent measure of resource content. We explicitly contrast these with Chirgwin-Coulson weights, demonstrating that L\"owdin weights ensure non-negativity, a prerequisite for information-theoretic measures. These weights further enable the quantification of coherence and the characterization of superposition, providing a degree of superposition as a distinct measure, as well as facilitating the assessment of state delocalization through entropy and participation ratios. Our theoretical and numerical analyses confirm LSO's superior preservation of quantum state symmetry and resource characteristics, underscoring the critical role of orthogonalization methods and L\"owdin weights in resource theory frameworks involving non-orthogonal bases.</description>

      <title>Landau-de Gennes Modelling of Confinement Effects and Cybotactic Clusters in Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudhana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the additional ordering induced by the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and potential biaxiality induced by antagonistic $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$-profiles.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-induced vanishing of brane partition functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of 't Hooft anomalies, backgrounds for the symmetries of a quantum field theory can lead to non-conservation of Noether currents, or more generally, to the presence of charged insertions in the path integral. When there is a net background charge, the partition function evaluated on closed manifolds will vanish. For anomalous symmetries, this statement can also be understood as the anomaly theory giving rise to a non-trivial anomalous phase for the partition function even for "rigid" transformations which leave all background fields unchanged. We use the generalisation of this second viewpoint to the setting of anomalous higher-form symmetries in order to show vanishing of the partition function for a number of examples, both with and without a Lagrangian description. In particular, we show how to derive from these considerations the analogue of the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition for the M5-brane, and also that for the D3-brane in S-fold backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For non-trivial solutions to the zero mode equation on a closed spin manifold \[D \varphi=iA\cdot \varphi,\] we first provide a simple proof for the sharp inequality \eq{ \norm{A}_{L^n}^2 \ge \frac {n}{4(n-1)} Y(M,[g]), } where $Y(M,[g])$ is the Yamabe constant of $(M,g)$, which was obtained by Frank-Loss and Reuss. Then we classify completely the equality case by proving that equality holds if and only if $\varphi$ is a Killing spinor, and if and only if $(M,g)$ is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold with $A$ (up to scaling) as its Reeb field and $\varphi$ a vacuum up to a conformal transformation. More generalizations have been also studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that fractional calculus is an effective alternative mathematical tool in various scientific fields. However, some investigations indicate that results established in differential and integral calculus do not necessarily hold true in fractional calculus. In this work we will compare various methods presented in the literature to improve the Gradient Descent Method, in terms of convergence of the method, convergence to the extreme point, and convergence rate. In general, these methods that generalize the gradient descent algorithm by replacing the gradient with a fractional-order operator are inefficient in achieving convergence to the extremum point of the objective function. To avoid these difficulties, we proposed to choose the Fractional Continuous Time algorithm to generalize the gradient method. In this approach, the convergence of the method to the extreme point of the function is guaranteed by introducing the fractional order in the time derivative, rather than in of the gradient. In this case, the issue of finding the extreme point is resolved, while the issue of stability at the equilibrium point remains.
  Fractional Continuous Time method converges to extreme point of cost function when fractional-order is between 0 and 1. The simulations shown in this work suggests that a similar result can be found when $1 \leq \alpha \leq 2$. { This paper highlights the main advantages and disadvantages of generalizations of the gradient method using fractional derivatives, aiming to optimize convergence in complex problems. Some chemical problems, with n=11 and 24 optimization parameters, are employed as means of evaluating the efficacy of the propose algorithms. In general, previous studies are restricted to mathematical questions and simple illustrative examples.</description>
