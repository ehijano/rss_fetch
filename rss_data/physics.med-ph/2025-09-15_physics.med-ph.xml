      <title>An overview of PBPK and PopPK Models: Applications to Radiopharmaceutical Therapies for Analysis and Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review discusses the current applications, advantages, and limitations of PBPK and PopPK models in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). PBPK models simulate radiopharmaceutical kinetics by integrating prior physiological and drug parameter information, whereas PopPK models leverage population data to enhance individual dose estimation accuracy. Future directions include developing hybrid models, incorporating artificial intelligence, and establishing regulatory guidelines to promote their clinical adoption. Ultimately, these modeling strategies aim to enable precise, personalized RPT dosing, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and safety.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low field 13C MRI of hyperpolarized pyruvate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medicine is evolving beyond therapy largely predicated on anatomical information and towards incorporating patient-specific molecular biomarkers of disease for more accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. The complementary combination of hyperpolarization by spin-lock induced crossing signal amplification by reversible exchange (SLIC SABRE) and low field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can enable accessible metabolic imaging to advance personalized medicine. Hyperpolarized 13C-enriched pyruvate has demonstrated utility for MRI of metabolism in cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disorders but has been restricted from widespread clinical adoption by a lack of access to affordable technology. Parahydrogen-based polarization techniques, paired with low-cost high-performance MRI at millitesla fields, offer a means of broadening the reach of metabolic imaging. Here we show results demonstrating in situ hyperpolarization of pyruvate at 6.5 mT by SLIC SABRE, followed by immediate readout without field cycling or sample shuttling. We achieve 13C signal enhancements several million times above thermal equilibrium at 6.5 mT, corresponding to polarization levels of approximately 3%. Leveraging this enhancement, we perform 13C MRI and acquire NMR spectra with resolution sufficient to distinguish chemical shifts between pyruvate isotopomers. These results show a viable pathway towards accessible metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized 13C MRI at ultra-low field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing understanding and clinical applications of cerebral autoregulation: A novel integrated numerical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a fundamental mechanism that modulates cerebrovascular resistance, primarily by regulating the diameter of small cerebral vessels to maintain stable cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to fluctuations in systemic arterial pressure. However, the clinical understanding of CA remains limited due to the intricate structure of the cerebral vasculature and the challenges in accurately quantifying the hemodynamic and physiological parameters that govern this autoregulatory process. Method: In this study, we introduced a novel numerical algorithm that employs three partial differential equations and one ordinary differential equation to capture both the spatial and temporal distributions of key CA-driving factors, including the arterial pressure (P) and the partial pressures of oxygen (PO_2) and carbon dioxide (PCO_2) within the cerebral vasculature, together with a Windkessel model in turn to regulate the CBF based on the calculated P, PO_2, and PCO_2. This algorithm was sequentially integrated with our previously developed personalized 0D-1D multi-dimensional model to account for the patient-specific effects. Results: The integrated framework was rigorously validated using two independent datasets, demonstrating its high reliability and accuracy in capturing the regulatory effects of CA on CBF across a range of physiological conditions. Conclusion: This work significantly advances our understanding of CA and provides a promising foundation for developing hemodynamic-based therapeutic strategies aimed at improving clinical outcomes in patients with cerebrovascular disorders.</description>

      <title>Viewing heat through ice: an infrared camera monitors hydrogel freezing and thawing during cryoapplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryosurgery employs a safe and relatively simple technique of exposure and is an advantageous and highly rated method. For its effective application, it is necessary to control both the volume of the expanding freezing zone and volumetric thermal field dynamics. The aim of this study was to perform a thermal imaging study of freezing and thawing in a model system (gel phantom) to predict the dynamics of the freezing zone during cryodestruction of biological tissues in vivo. Here, the thermal imager is an effective tool for demonstrating the surface temperature distribution. We have studied how the observed infrared image relates to the distribution and change of the thermal field in depth. For this purpose, we created test measuring equipment for simultaneous analysis of the dynamics of thermal fields on the surface, video recording of freezing and thawing on the surface as well as in the depth of the gel phantom, measuring the temperature at any given point in the depth and modeling in the zone of low-temperature exposure of vessels with different blood flow parameters. It was revealed that with a modeled vessel in the low-temperature exposure zone, the surface thermal fields deformed and they gained the shape of butterfly wings. Our experimental study in a gel phantom is supported by numerical calculations, demonstrating how the freezing zone and thermal isotherms on the surface and in depth evolve under real conditions, thereby providing a basis for assessing the cryoeffect time and intensity in practice. Key words: cryoapplication; freezing; thawing; temperature field dynamics; infrared thermography; gel phantom; testing measuring equipment; vessel simulation.</description>

      <title>Field evaluation of a wearable instrumented headband designed for measuring head kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To study the relationship between soccer heading and the risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we previously developed an instrumented headband and data processing scheme to measure the angular head kinematics of soccer headers. Laboratory evaluation of the headband on an anthropomorphic test device showed good agreement with a reference sensor for soccer ball impacts to the front of the head. In this study, we evaluate the headband in measuring the full head kinematics of soccer headers in the field. Methods: The headband was evaluated under typical soccer heading scenarios (throw-ins, goal-kicks, and corner-kicks) on a human subject. The measured time history and peak kinematics from the headband were compared with those from an instrumented mouthpiece, which is a widely accepted method for measuring head kinematics in the field. Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the headband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest agreement for angular velocities (0.79 \pm 0.08) and translational accelerations (0.73 \pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \pm 0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and mouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading) for the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1% for the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the instrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some kinematic measures and impact conditions. Future work should focus on improving the headband performance across all kinematic measures.</description>

      <title>Automated Tuning for Diffusion Inverse Problem Solvers without Generative Prior Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion/score-based models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, including accelerated MRI reconstruction. While their flexibility allows decoupling the measurement model from the learned prior, their performance heavily depends on carefully tuned data fidelity weights, especially under fast sampling schedules with few denoising steps. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or fixed weights, which fail to generalize across varying measurement conditions and irregular timestep schedules. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling (ZADS), a test-time optimization method that adaptively tunes fidelity weights across arbitrary noise schedules without requiring retraining of the diffusion prior. ZADS treats the denoising process as a fixed unrolled sampler and optimizes fidelity weights in a self-supervised manner using only undersampled measurements. Experiments on the fastMRI knee dataset demonstrate that ZADS consistently outperforms both traditional compressed sensing and recent diffusion-based methods, showcasing its ability to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions across varying noise schedules and acquisition settings.</description>

      <title>Motion simulation of radio-labeled cells in whole-body positron emission tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell tracking is a subject of active research gathering great interest in medicine and biology. Positron emission tomography (PET) is well suited for tracking radio-labeled cells in vivo due to its exceptional sensitivity and whole-body capability. For validation, ground-truth data are desirable that realistically mimic the flow of cells in a clinical situation. This study develops a workflow (CeFloPS) for simulating moving radio-labeled cells in a human phantom. From the XCAT phantom, the blood vessels are reduced to nodal networks along which cells can move and distribute to organs and tissues. The movement is directed by the blood flow, which is calculated in each node using the Hagen-Pooiseuille equation and Kirchhoff's laws assuming laminar flow. Organs are voxelized and movement of cells from artery entry to vein exit is generated via a biased 3D random walk. The probabilities of cells moving or remaining in tissues are derived from rate constants of tracer kinetic-based compartment modeling. PET listmode data is generated using the Monte-Carlo simulation framework GATE based on the definition of a large-body PET scanner with cell paths as moving radioactive sources and the XCAT phantom providing attenuation data. From the flow simulation of 100,000 cells, 100 sample cells were further processed by GATE and listmode data was reconstructed into images for comparison. As demonstrated by comparisons of simulated and reconstructed cell distributions, CeFloPS is capable of simulating cell behavior in whole-body PET. It achieves this simulation in a way that is anatomically and physiologically reasonable, thereby providing valuable data for the development and validation of cell tracking algorithms.</description>

      <title>Impact of deep learning model uncertainty on manual corrections to auto-segmentation in prostate cancer radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning (DL)-based organ segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, yet voxel-wise DL uncertainty maps are rarely presented to clinicians. Purpose: This study assessed how DL-generated uncertainty maps impact radiation oncologists during manual correction of prostate radiotherapy DL segmentations. Methods: Two nnUNet models were trained by 10-fold cross-validation on 434 MRI-only prostate cancer cases to segment the prostate and rectum. Each model was evaluated on 35 independent cases. Voxel-wise uncertainty was calculated using the SoftMax standard deviation (n=10) and visualized as a color-coded map. Four oncologists performed segmentation in two steps: Step 1: Rated segmentation quality and confidence using Likert scales and edited DL segmentations without uncertainty maps. Step 2 ($\geq 4$ weeks later): Repeated step 1, but with uncertainty maps available. Segmentation time was recorded for both steps, and oncologists provided qualitative free-text feedback. Histogram analysis compared voxel edits across uncertainty levels. Results: DL segmentations showed high agreement with oncologist edits. Quality ratings varied: rectum segmentation ratings slightly decreased overall in step 2, while prostate ratings differed among oncologists. Confidence ratings also varied. Three oncologists reduced segmentation time with uncertainty maps, saving 1-2 minutes per case. Histogram analysis showed 50% fewer edits for step 2 in low-uncertainty areas. Conclusions: Presenting DL segmentation uncertainty information to radiation oncologists influences their decision-making, quality perception, and confidence in the DL segmentations. Low-uncertainty regions were edited less frequently, indicating increased trust in DL predictions. Uncertainty maps improve efficiency by reducing segmentation time and can be a valuable clinical tool, enhancing radiotherapy planning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for Dose Prediction in Targeted Radionuclide: A Synthetic Data Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT) is a modern strategy in radiation oncology that aims to administer a potent radiation dose specifically to cancer cells using cancer-targeting radiopharmaceuticals. Accurate radiation dose estimation tailored to individual patients is crucial. Deep learning, particularly with pre-therapy imaging, holds promise for personalizing TRT doses. However, current methods require large time series of SPECT imaging, which is hardly achievable in routine clinical practice, and thus raises issues of data availability. Our objective is to develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) solution to personalize dosimetry using pre-therapy images. The aim is to develop an approach that achieves accurate results when PET/CT images are available, but are associated with only a few post-therapy dosimetry data provided by SPECT images. In this work, we introduce an SSL method using a pseudo-label generation approach for regression tasks inspired by the FixMatch framework. The feasibility of the proposed solution was preliminarily evaluated through an in-silico study using synthetic data and Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results for organ dose prediction yielded promising outcomes, showing that the use of pseudo-labeled data provides better accuracy compared to using only labeled data.</description>
