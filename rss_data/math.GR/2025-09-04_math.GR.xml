      <title>Groups of finite type: classification and structural properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groups of finite type (also called finitely constrained groups), introduced by Grigorchuk, are known to be the closure of regular branch groups. This article explores many of their properties.
  Firstly, we prove that being finitely generated, just-infinite and strongly complete are equivalent in a vast family of groups of finite type. As a consequence, we prove that the closure of the Hanoi towers group on 3 pegs is just-infinite although the group itself is not.
  Secondly, we improve the algorithm given by Bondarenko and Samoilovych in [9], to compute all the groups of finite type of a given depth and acting on a given tree. We use this to find the groups of finite type acting on the ternary tree with depth 2 and 3.
  Thirdly, we give a sufficient condition for a group generated by a finite automaton of Mealy type to have as closure a group of finite type. This allows us to identify groups of finite type as the closure of explicit groups generated by a finite automaton.
  Lastly, we give an algorithm to prove whether two groups of finite type are isomorphic. With this result, we classify groups of finite type up to isomorphism in the binary tree for depths 2, 3 and 4 and in the ternary tree for depths 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>On automorphisms, quasimorphisms, and coarse automorphisms of acylindrically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the action of the automorphism group of an acylindrically hyperbolic group G on its space of homogeneous quasimorphisms, and identify its kernel with the subgroup of "strongly commensurating" automorphisms. We deduce that if G has no non-trivial finite normal subgroups then it has sufficiently many quasimorphisms to recognize whether an automorphism is inner. As consequences, we show that Out(G) acts faithfully on the kernel of the comparison map in bounded cohomology and it embeds in (several) groups of coarse automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Finite Index Rigidity of Relatively Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, given a torsion-free relatively hyperbolic group G with non-relatively-hyperbolic peripherals, isomorphic finite index subgroups of G have the same index. This applies for instance to fundamental groups of finite-volume negatively curved manifolds, to limit groups, and to free-by-cyclic groups. More generally, we show that if two finite index subgroups of a relatively hyperbolic group are isomorphic via a map that respects their peripheral structures, then their indices in the ambient group are equal. The proof relies on demonstrating that the number of simplices in a simplicial classifying space of a finite index subgroup in a relatively hyperbolic group grows linearly with its index. These results generalize earlier work of the first author in the context of hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Classification of thin Jordan schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>

      <title>Submonoids of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set $X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this task. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the symmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite partition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in semigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover that the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the idempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms and partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore, we show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains a finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$ generates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$ under a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for the symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of subsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate a conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.</description>

      <title>Stabilizers and NIP arithmetic regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the NIP arithmetic regularity lemma for finite groups (due to the authors and Pillay), which describes the approximate structure of "NIP sets" in finite groups, i.e., subsets whose collection of left translates has bounded VC-dimension. Our new proof avoids sophisticated ingredients from the model theory of NIP formulas (e.g., Borel definability and generic compact domination). The key tool is an elaboration on an elementary lemma due to Alon, Fox, and Zhao concerning the behavior of subgroups contained in stabilizers. We adapt this lemma to arbitrary subsets of stabilizers using technical (but elementary) maneuvers based on work of Sisask. Using another trick from Alon, Fox, and Zhao, we then give an effective proof of a related result of the first author and Pillay on finite NIP sets of bounded tripling in arbitrary groups. Along the way, we show that NIP sets satisfy a strong form of the Polynomial Bogolyubov-Ruzsa Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane arrangements and Vinberg's $\theta$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} /m \mathbb{Z}} \mathfrak{g}_i$ be a periodically graded semisimple complex Lie algebra. In this note, we give a uniform proof of the recent result by W. de Graaf and H. V. L\^e that the hyperplane arrangement determined by the restrictions of the roots of $\mathfrak{g}$ to a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{c} \subset \mathfrak{g}_1$ coincides with the hyperplane arrangement of (complex) reflections of the little Weyl group of $\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} /m \mathbb{Z}} \mathfrak{g}_i$.</description>

      <title>Higher Segal spaces and partial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The d-Segal conditions of Dyckerhoff and Kapranov are exactness properties for simplicial objects based on the geometry of cyclic polytopes in d-dimensional Euclidean space. 2-Segal spaces are also known as decomposition spaces, and most activity has focused on this case. We study the interplay of these conditions with the partial groups of Chermak, a class of symmetric simplicial sets. The d-Segal conditions simplify for symmetric simplicial objects, and take a particularly explicit form for partial groups. We show partial groups provide a rich class of d-Segal sets for d &gt; 2, by undertaking a systematic study of the "degree" of a partial group X, namely the smallest nonnegative integer k such that X is 2k-Segal. We develop effective tools to explicitly compute the degree based on the discrete geometry of actions of partial groups, which we define and study. Applying these tools involves solving Helly-type problems for abstract closure spaces. We carry out degree computations in concrete settings, including for the punctured Weyl groups introduced here, where we find that the degree is closely related to the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra of the associated semisimple Lie algebra.</description>
