      <title>Experimental verification of Generalised Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized synchronization (GS) describes a state in which two coupled dynamical systems exhibit a functional relationship between their variables. GS can be achieved by appropriately designing the coupling to constrain the dynamics onto an invariant submanifold, a concept well established in theory. However, experimental validation remains crucial. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate GS using coupled chaotic Lorenz oscillators, implementing unidirectional coupling where the state variables of the slave oscillator are scaled according to a predefined relationship with those of the master oscillator.</description>

      <title>Dynamical entropy of the separatrix map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the motion in the separatrix map's chaotic layer, along with calculation of its width, as functions of the adiabaticity parameter $\lambda$. The separatrix map is set in natural variables; and the case of the layer's least perturbed border is considered, i.~e., the winding number of the layer's border (the last invariant curve) is the golden mean. Although these two dependences (for the Lyapunov exponent and the layer width) are strongly non-monotonous and evade any simple analytical description, the calculated dynamical entropy $h$ turns out to be a close-to-linear function of $\lambda$. In other words, if normalized by $\lambda$, the entropy is a quasi-constant. We discuss whether the function $h(\lambda)$ can be in fact exactly linear, $h \propto \lambda$. The function $h(\lambda)$ forms a basis for calculating the dynamical entropy for any perturbed nonlinear resonance in the first fundamental model, as soon as the corresponding Melnikov--Arnold integral is estimated.</description>

      <title>Transitions to Intermittent Chaos in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyses the dynamical consequences of heterogeneous temporal delays within a quorum sensing-inspired (QS-inspired) system, specifically addressing the differential response kinetics of two subpopulations to signalling molecules. A nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) model, predicated upon an activator-inhibitor framework, is formulated to represent the interspecies interactions. Key analytical techniques, including the derivation of the pseudo-characteristic polynomial and the determination of Hopf bifurcation criteria, are employed to investigate the stability properties of steady-state solutions. The analysis reveals the critical role of multiple, dissimilar delays in modulating system dynamics and inducing bifurcations. Numerical simulations, conducted in conjunction with analytical results, reveal the emergence of periodic self-sustained oscillations and intermittent chaotic behaviour. These observations emphasise the intricate relationship between temporal heterogeneity and the stability landscape of systems exhibiting QS-inspired dynamics. This interplay highlights the capacity for temporal variations to induce complex dynamical transitions within such systems. These findings assist to the comprehension of temporal dynamics within these and related systems, and may contribute to the development of strategies aimed at modulating intercellular communication and engineering synthetic biological systems with temporal control.</description>

      <title>Developing cholera outbreak forecasting through qualitative dynamics: Insights into Malawi case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, is a serious concern in developing and underdeveloped areas. A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to foresee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models. The mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease transmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is essential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks to furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics followed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify critical parameters that illustrate the disease's dynamics using partial rank correlation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction number as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore, forward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf bifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as societal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine learning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into autoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks. We forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the proposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert that integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance the capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism can significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This evolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and respond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable and adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The regular logistic map was introduced in 1960s, served as an example of a complex system, and was used as an instrument to demonstrate and investigate the period doubling cascade of bifurcations scenario of transition to chaos. In this paper, we review various fractional generalizations of the logistic map and their applications.</description>

      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimp-shaped regions reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthy functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>
