      <title>Improved Receiver Chain Performance via Error Location Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern spacecraft communication systems rely on concatenated error correction schemes, typically combining convolutional and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. This paper presents a decoder-side method that uses a machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of byte-level corruption in received data frames. These estimates are used to mark erasures prior to RS decoding, enhancing its correction capacity without requiring changes to spacecraft hardware or encoding standards. The approach enables improved data recovery under degraded signal conditions at a gain of 0.3 decibels.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Copula-Based Outage Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems: Channel Coefficient- or Envelope-Level Correlation Matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian copula has been employed to evaluate the outage performance of Fluid Antenna Systems (FAS), with the covariance matrix reflecting the dependence among multivariate normal random variables (RVs). While prior studies approximate this matrix using the channel coefficient correlation matrix from Jake's model, this work instead employs the channel envelope correlation matrix, motivated by the fact that the multivariate normal RVs are generated by transforming correlated channel envelopes. This raises an open question of whether using the coefficient- or envelope-level correlation matrix yields better accuracy in accessing FAS performance. Toward this end, this paper explores the benefits of using the envelope-level correlation matrix under fully correlated Nakagami-m fading, and develops a method for generating such fading channels for Monte Carlo simulations, which serve as a benchmark for validating the theoretical results. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed channel modeling approach and demonstrate the superior accuracy of using the envelope-level correlation matrix, particularly in sparse port deployment and low-outage regime.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Semantics Transmission for Generative AI-Enabled Semantic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a mixture of semantics (MoS) transmission strategy for wireless semantic communication systems based on generative artificial intelligence (AI). At the transmitter, we divide an image into regions of interest (ROI) and reigons of non-interest (RONI) to extract their semantic information respectively. Semantic information of ROI can be allocated more bandwidth, while RONI can be represented in a compact form for transmission. At the receiver, a diffusion model reconstructs the full image using the received semantic information of ROI and RONI. Compared to existing generative AI-based methods, MoS enables more efficient use of channel resources by balancing visual fidelity and semantic relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that appropriate ROI-RONI allocation is critical. The MoS achieves notable performance gains in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of ROI and CLIP score of RONI.</description>

      <title>Fast Polarisation-Aware Decoder for Non-Binary Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates the emerging field of low-complexity non-binary polar code (NB-PC) decoders. It shows that customizing each kernel of an NB-PC decoder through offline analysis can significantly reduce the overall decoding complexity. The proposed decoder, referred to as the Fast Successive Cancellation-Polarization Aware (FSC-PA) scheme, achieves this by minimizing the computational load of parity-check nodes that share the same level of input polarization. The NB polar decoder is developed for both BPSK and CCSK modulations. Compared to the state-of-the-art extended min-sum algorithm, the FSC-PA algorithm achieves an overall reduction of 60 percents in field additions and 30 percents in real additions, while incurring only a negligible performance loss (less than 0.2 dB degradation).</description>

      <title>RSMA-Enhanced Data Collection in RIS-Assisted Intelligent Consumer Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the data collection enhancement problem in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered intelligent consumer transportation system (ICTS). We propose a novel framework where a data center (DC) provides energy to pre-configured roadside unit (RSU) pairs during the downlink stage. While in the uplink stage, these RSU pairs utilize a hybrid rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) protocol to transmit the processed data to the DC, while simultaneously performing local data processing using the harvested energy. Our objective is to maximize the minimal processed data volume of the RSU pairs by jointly optimizing the RIS downlink and uplink phase shifts, the transmit power of the DC and RSUs, the RSU computation resource allocation, and the time slot allocation. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm integrating alternating optimization and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation methods. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes under diverse scenarios, validating its effectiveness in enhancing the data processing performance for intelligent transportation applications.</description>

      <title>The Eigenvalue Method in Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay down the foundations of the Eigenvalue Method in coding theory. The method uses modern algebraic graph theory to derive upper bounds on the size of error-correcting codes for various metrics, addressing major open questions in the field. We identify the core assumptions that allow applying the Eigenvalue Method, test it for multiple well-known classes of error-correcting codes, and compare the results with the best bounds currently available. By applying the Eigenvalue Method, we obtain new bounds on the size of error-correcting codes that often improve the state of the art. Our results show that spectral graph theory techniques capture structural properties of error-correcting codes that are missed by classical coding theory approaches.</description>

      <title>Retrocausal capacity of a quantum channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the capacity of a quantum channel for retrocausal communication, where messages are transmitted backward in time, from a sender in the future to a receiver in the past, through a noisy postselected closed timelike curve (P-CTC) represented by the channel. We completely characterize the one-shot retrocausal quantum and classical capacities of a quantum channel, and we show that the corresponding asymptotic capacities are equal to the average and sum, respectively, of the channel's max-information and its regularized Doeblin information. This endows these information measures with a novel operational interpretation. Furthermore, our characterization can be generalized beyond quantum channels to all completely positive maps. This imposes information-theoretic limits on transmitting messages via postselected-teleportation-like mechanisms with arbitrary initial- and final-state boundary conditions, including those considered in various black-hole final-state models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Blaschke--Santal\'o-type inequalities, without symmetry restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nakamura and Tsuji (2024) recently investigated a many-function generalization of the functional Blaschke--Santal\'o inequality, which they refer to as a generalized Legendre duality relation. They showed that, among the class of all even test functions, centered Gaussian functions saturate this general family of functional inequalities. Leveraging a certain entropic duality, we give a short alternate proof of Nakamura and Tsuji's result, and, in the process, eliminate all symmetry assumptions. As an application, we establish a Talagrand-type inequality for the Wasserstein barycenter problem (without symmetry restrictions) originally conjectured by Kolesnikov and Werner (\textit{Adv.~Math.}, 2022). An analogous geometric Blaschke--Santal\'o-type inequality is established for many convex bodies, again without symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <title>Channel Polarization under Channel Noise with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The channel polarization behavior of polar codes under noise with memory is investigated. By introducing a genie-aided channel model, we first show that the polarized subchannels still converge to extremal channels under the standard polar coding framework. More importantly, we explicitly quantify the gap between the mutual information achieved by ignoring memory effects and the actual capacity attained after sufficient polarization. It is proven that the channel capacity remains achievable even without prior knowledge of the channel noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the polarization rate is slower than that in the binary-input memoryless channel (BMC) case, provided that the channel transition function satisfies certain conditions. In particular, the Bhattacharyya parameter is asymptotically upper-bounded and lower-bounded by a polynomial function and an exponential function with respect to the block length, respectively.</description>

      <title>Age of Information in Short Packet Multi-Connectivity Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate multi-connectivity schemes in the context of status update systems with short payloads. As the performance metric, we use the Age of Information (AoI). Due to short payloads, transmission errors must be taken into account. In addition to the well-known schemes of packet duplication, message splitting, and multiplexing, we propose a codeword splitting scheme, where each status update is jointly encoded across multiple channels. We derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI for the different schemes and optimize their corresponding parameters. We show that the AoI of the multiplexing scheme is a convex function in the offset parameters and use this result to prove that for homogeneous channels, the multiplexing scheme outperforms the packet duplication scheme, which is outperformed by the codeword splitting scheme. Analytical comparisons and numerical evaluations show that the codeword splitting scheme achieves the lowest average AoI when joint coding is feasible. In scenarios where joint coding is not feasible, whether message splitting or multiplexing results in a lower average AoI depends on the specific parameters.</description>

      <title>Data Sourcing Random Access using Semantic Queries for Massive IoT Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently retrieving relevant data from massive Internet of Things (IoT) networks is essential for downstream tasks such as machine learning. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel data sourcing protocol that combines semantic queries and random access. The key idea is that the destination node broadcasts a semantic query describing the desired information, and the sensors that have data matching the query then respond by transmitting their observations over a shared random access channel, for example to perform joint inference at the destination. However, this approach introduces a tradeoff between maximizing the retrieval of relevant data and minimizing data loss due to collisions on the shared channel. We analyze this tradeoff under a tractable Gaussian mixture model and optimize the semantic matching threshold to maximize the number of relevant retrieved observations. The protocol and the analysis are then extended to handle a more realistic neural network-based model for complex sensing. Under both models, experimental results in classification scenarios demonstrate that the proposed protocol is superior to traditional random access, and achieves a near-optimal balance between inference accuracy and the probability of missed detection, highlighting its effectiveness for semantic query-based data sourcing in massive IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Data Compression with Relative Entropy Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last few years, machine learning unlocked previously infeasible features for compression, such as providing guarantees for users' privacy or tailoring compression to specific data statistics (e.g., satellite images or audio recordings of animals) or users' audiovisual perception. This, in turn, has led to an explosion of theoretical investigations and insights that aim to develop new fundamental theories, methods and algorithms better suited for machine learning-based compressors.
  In this thesis, I contribute to this trend by investigating relative entropy coding, a mathematical framework that generalises classical source coding theory. Concretely, relative entropy coding deals with the efficient communication of uncertain or randomised information. One of its key advantages is that it extends compression methods to continuous spaces and can thus be integrated more seamlessly into modern machine learning pipelines than classical quantisation-based approaches. Furthermore, it is a natural foundation for developing advanced compression methods that are privacy-preserving or account for the perceptual quality of the reconstructed data.
  The thesis considers relative entropy coding at three conceptual levels: After introducing the basics of the framework, (1) I prove results that provide new, maximally tight fundamental limits to the communication and computational efficiency of relative entropy coding; (2) I use the theory of Poisson point processes to develop and analyse new relative entropy coding algorithms, whose performance attains the theoretic optima and (3) I showcase the strong practical performance of relative entropy coding by applying it to image, audio, video and protein data compression using small, energy-efficient, probabilistic neural networks called Bayesian implicit neural representations.</description>

      <title>Deviation Inequalities for R\'{e}nyi Divergence Estimators via Variational Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R\'enyi divergences play a pivotal role in information theory, statistics, and machine learning. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the literature with their consistency properties established and minimax convergence rates quantified, existing accounts of probabilistic bounds governing the estimation error are relatively underdeveloped. Here, we make progress in this regard by establishing exponential deviation inequalities for smoothed plug-in estimators and neural estimators by relating the error to an appropriate empirical process and leveraging tools from empirical process theory. In particular, our approach does not require the underlying distributions to be compactly supported or have densities bounded away from zero, an assumption prevalent in existing results. The deviation inequality also leads to a one-sided concentration bound from the expectation, which is useful in random-coding arguments over continuous alphabets in information theory with potential applications to physical-layer security. As another concrete application, we consider a hypothesis testing framework for auditing R\'{e}nyi differential privacy using the neural estimator as a test statistic and obtain non-asymptotic performance guarantees for such a test.</description>
