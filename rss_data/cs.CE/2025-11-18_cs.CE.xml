      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Reliability Analysis of Buried Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buried pipelines transporting oil and gas across geohazard-prone regions are exposed to potential ground movement, leading to the risk of significant strain demand and structural failure. Reliability analysis, which determines the probability of failure after accounting for pertinent uncertainties, is essential for ensuring the safety of pipeline systems. However, traditional reliability analysis methods involving computationally intensive numerical models, such as finite element simulations of pipeline subjected to ground movement, have limited applications; this is partly because stochastic sampling approaches require repeated simulations over a large number of samples for the uncertain variables when estimating low probabilities. This study introduces Physics-Informed Neural Network for Reliability Analysis (PINN-RA) for buried pipelines subjected to ground movement, which integrates PINN-based surrogate model with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to achieve efficient reliability assessment. To enable its application under uncertain variables associated with soil properties and ground movement, the PINN-based surrogate model is extended to solve a parametric differential equation system, namely the governing equation of pipelines embedded in soil with different properties. The findings demonstrate that PINN-RA significantly reduces the computational effort required and thus accelerates reliability analysis. By eliminating the need for repetitive numerical evaluations of pipeline subjected to permanent ground movement, the proposed approach provides an efficient and scalable tool for pipeline reliability assessment, enabling rapid decision-making in geohazard-prone regions.</description>

      <title>Preference Learning from Physics-Based Feedback: Tuning Language Models to Design BCC/B2 Superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply preference learning to the task of language model-guided design of novel structural alloys. In contrast to prior work that focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach targets the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with potential applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or human-in-the-loop feedback (costly), our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically grounded criterion for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for structural alloy design. The resulting framework is general and extensible, providing a path forward for intelligent design-space exploration across a range of physical science domains.</description>

      <title>Modelling Heterogeneous Interfaces using Element-based Finite Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately depicting multiphysics interactions in interfacial systems requires computational frameworks capable of reconciling geometric adaptability with strict conservation fidelity. However, traditional spatiotemporal discretisation methods often compromise between mesh flexibility and flow conservation enforcement, hence constraining their effectiveness in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Here, we respond to these computational demands by developing a novel three-dimensional adaptation of the Element-based Finite Volume Method (EbFVM) -- a hybrid numerical strategy that merges the geometric flexibility of Finite Element Methods with the conservation-centric principles of Finite Volume Methods. The proposed framework introduces advanced discretisation techniques tailored to unstructured, irregular mesh entities, including detailed parametric shape functions, robust flux integration schemes and rigorous body-fitted curvilinear coordinate mappings. Through a series of lubrication-driven benchmark problems, we demonstrate the EbFVM's capacity to capture intricate transport phenomena, strong field couplings and scale disparities across geometrically complex domains. By enabling accurate modelling in geometrically and physically challenging interfacial systems, the three-dimensional EbFVM offers a versatile and generalisable tool for simulating transport phenomena in a plethora of multiphysics applications.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Based Unsupervised Learning Framework for Bridge Damage Detection in Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) are designed to offer dual functionality in structural health monitoring (SHM): harvesting electric power from bridge vibrations while serving as intrinsic damage sensors. This strategy utilises the voltage signal directly as the sensing input, eliminating the need for traditional sensing modules and thereby reducing system complexity and energy consumption. A bi-objective optimisation framework is proposed to maximise both power output and damage detection accuracy of a PEH modelled as a composite cantilevered Kirchhoff-Love plate. Voltage responses under realistic bridge inputs are predicted via isogeometric analysis. The approach is validated in two scenarios: a numerical vehicle-bridge interaction model and a laboratory-scale beam test using a toy car, each evaluated in both healthy and damaged states. Unsupervised damage detection is achieved using a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained solely on healthy voltage signatures. The NSGA-II algorithm is applied to explore trade-offs between energy yield and sensing precision, including parametric studies on damage severity, damage location, and harvester geometry. Results indicate that optimised PEHs not only act as an effective filter and sensing component but also outperform traditional acceleration-based sensing, improving damage detection accuracy by 13% while reducing energy consumption by 98%. The multi-parameter design space further highlights the importance of bi-objective optimisation due to variations in performance even under resonant conditions. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of replacing traditional sensors with lightweight, self-powered PEHs and pave the way for sustainable simultaneous energy harvesting and sensing (SEHS) systems.</description>

      <title>Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning Closing the Diagnostic Pedagogical Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, producing help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted microinterventions. The adaptive learning algorithm includes three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted limit for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formulate intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows derived from ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy with diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency settings, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid switches along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with 1204 students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for nearly all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by about 12 percentage points relative to greedy and produced more consistent difficulty alignment, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy at lower computational cost in resource-scarce environments. Slack variables localized missing content and guided targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across student subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic pedagogical loop and enables equitable, load-aware personalization at the classroom scale.</description>

      <title>MedBuild AI: An Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Reshaping Agency in Healthcare Infrastructure Planning through Generative Design for Medical Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11587v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</description>

      <title>Predicting Grain Growth in Polycrystalline Materials Using Deep Learning Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grain Growth strongly influences the mechanical behavior of materials, making its prediction a key objective in microstructural engineering. In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization.</description>

      <title>DK-Root: A Joint Data-and-Knowledge-Driven Framework for Root Cause Analysis of QoE Degradations in Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagnosing the root causes of Quality of Experience (QoE) degradations in operational mobile networks is challenging due to complex cross-layer interactions among kernel performance indicators (KPIs) and the scarcity of reliable expert annotations. Although rule-based heuristics can generate labels at scale, they are noisy and coarse-grained, limiting the accuracy of purely data-driven approaches. To address this, we propose DK-Root, a joint data-and-knowledge-driven framework that unifies scalable weak supervision with precise expert guidance for robust root-cause analysis. DK-Root first pretrains an encoder via contrastive representation learning using abundant rule-based labels while explicitly denoising their noise through a supervised contrastive objective. To supply task-faithful data augmentation, we introduce a class-conditional diffusion model that generates KPIs sequences preserving root-cause semantics, and by controlling reverse diffusion steps, it produces weak and strong augmentations that improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods. Ablations confirm the necessity of the conditional diffusion augmentation and the pretrain-finetune design, validating both representation quality and classification gains.</description>

      <title>BlinDNO: A Distributional Neural Operator for Dynamical System Reconstruction from Time-Label-Free data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inverse problem for stochastic and quantum dynamical systems in a time-label-free setting, where only unordered density snapshots sampled at unknown times drawn from an observation-time distribution are available. These observations induce a distribution over state densities, from which we seek to recover the parameters of the underlying evolution operator. We formulate this as learning a distribution-to-function neural operator and propose BlinDNO, a permutation-invariant architecture that integrates a multiscale U-Net encoder with an attention-based mixer. Numerical experiments on a wide range of stochastic and quantum systems, including a 3D protein-folding mechanism reconstruction problem in a cryo-EM setting, demonstrate that BlinDNO reliably recovers governing parameters and consistently outperforms existing neural inverse operator baselines.</description>

      <title>MolEdit: Knowledge Editing for Multimodal Molecule Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and continuously refining multimodal molecular knowledge is crucial for advancing biomedicine, chemistry, and materials science. Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency.

      <title>Case study of a differentiable heterogeneous multiphysics solver for a nuclear fusion application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a case study of a heterogeneous multiphysics solver from the nuclear fusion domain. At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping.</description>

      <title>Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alpha Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-strategy hedge funds face a fundamental organizational choice: should analysts generating trading strategies communicate, and if so, how? We investigate this using 5-agent LLM-based trading systems across 450 experiments spanning 21 months, comparing five organizational structures from isolated baseline to collaborative and competitive conversation. We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks. Conversation quality scores show zero correlation with returns. These findings demonstrate that optimal communication design must match market volatility characteristics, and sophisticated discussions don't guarantee better performance.</description>

Abstract: We use Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) to implement type-generic tangent and adjoint versions of $$ y=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{2 i} \cdot x_{2 i+1} $$ in C++. We run an instantiation for char-arithmetic and we print the gradient at $(101~77~114~114~32~121~109~88~115~97)^T$ to std::cout, yielding the output ``Merry Xmas''.
  Similar instantiations of type-generic second-order tangent and second-order adjoint versions of $$
  y=\frac{1}{6} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^3_{i} $$ yield ``Happy 2026'' at $(72~97~112~112~121~32~50~48~50~54)^T.$ Prepend a sufficiently large number of zeros to the input vector to explore the varying run times of the different derivative codes.

      <title>Revisiting the Canonicalization for Fast and Accurate Crystal Tensor Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the tensor properties of crystalline materials is a fundamental task in materials science. Unlike scalar property prediction, which requires invariance, tensor property prediction requires maintaining O(3) group tensor equivariance. Achieving such equivariance typically demands specialized architectural designs, which substantially increase computational cost. Canonicalization, a classical technique for geometry, has recently been explored for efficient learning with symmetry.In this work, we revisit the problem of crystal tensor property prediction through the lens of canonicalization. Specifically, we demonstrate how polar decomposition, a simple yet efficient algebraic method, can serve as a form of canonicalization and be leveraged to ensure equivariant tensor property prediction. Building upon this insight, we propose a general O(3)-equivariant framework for fast and accurate crystal tensor property prediction, referred to as GoeCTP. By utilizing canonicalization, GoeCTP achieves high efficiency without requiring the explicit incorporation of equivariance constraints into the network architecture.Experimental results indicate that GoeCTP achieves the high prediction accuracy and runs up to 13 times faster compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sparse Diffusion Autoencoder for Test-time Adapting Prediction of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of complex systems is critical in many scientific and engineering domains, and hinges on the model's ability to capture their underlying dynamics. Existing methods encode the intrinsic dynamics of high-dimensional observations through latent representations and predict autoregressively. However, these latent representations lose the inherent spatial structure of spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to the predictor's inability to effectively model spatial interactions and neglect emerging dynamics during long-term prediction. In this work, we propose SparseDiff, introducing a test-time adaptation strategy to dynamically update the encoding scheme to accommodate emergent spatiotemporal structures during the long-term evolution of the system. Specifically, we first design a codebook-based sparse encoder, which coarsens the continuous spatial domain into a sparse graph topology. Then, we employ a graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the dynamics and guide a diffusion decoder for reconstruction. SparseDiff autoregressively predicts the spatiotemporal evolution and adjust the sparse topological structure to adapt to emergent spatiotemporal patterns by adaptive re-encoding. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that SparseDiff achieves an average prediction error reduction of 49.99\% compared to baselines, requiring only 1% of the spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Aethorix v1.0: An Integrated Scientific AI Agent for Scalable Inorganic Materials Innovation and Industrial Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining the frontiers of scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to meteorological modeling, yet its integration within industrial manufacturing remains nascent and fraught with operational challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce Aethorix v1.0, an AI agent framework designed to overcome key industrial bottlenecks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in materials design innovation and process parameter optimization. Our tool is built upon three pillars: a scientific corpus reasoning engine that streamlines knowledge retrieval and validation, a diffusion-based generative model for zero-shot inverse design, and specialized interatomic potentials that enable faster screening with ab initio fidelity. We demonstrate Aethorix's utility through a real-world cement production case study, confirming its capacity for integration into industrial workflows and its role in revolutionizing the design-make-test-analyze loop while ensuring rigorous manufacturing standards are met.</description>

      <title>RoadBench: A Vision-Language Foundation Model and Benchmark for Road Damage Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate road damage detection is crucial for timely infrastructure maintenance and public safety, but existing vision-only datasets and models lack the rich contextual understanding that textual information can provide. To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning.</description>

      <title>Bounds of Block Rewards in Honest PinFi Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PinFi is a class of novel protocols for decentralized pricing of dissipative assets, whose value naturally declines over time. Central to the protocol's functionality and its market efficiency is the role of liquidity providers (LPs). This study addresses critical stability and sustainability challenges within the protocol, namely: the propensity of LPs to prefer selling in external markets over participation in the protocol; a similar inclination towards selling within the PinFi system rather than contributing as LPs; and a scenario where LPs are disinclined to sell within the protocol. Employing a game-theoretic approach, we explore PinFi's mechanisms and its broader ramifications. Our findings reveal that, under a variety of common conditions and with an assumption of participant integrity, PinFi is capable of fostering a dynamic equilibrium among LPs, sellers, and buyers. This balance is maintained through a carefully calibrated range of block rewards for LPs, ensuring the protocol's long-term stability and utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networked computing power is a critical utility in the era of artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel Physical Infrastructure Finance (PinFi) protocol designed to facilitate the distribution of computing power within networks in a decentralized manner. Addressing the core challenges of coordination, pricing, and liquidity in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), the PinFi protocol introduces a distinctive dynamic pricing mechanism. It enables providers to allocate excess computing resources to a "dissipative" PinFi liquidity pool, distinct from traditional DeFi liquidity pools, ensuring seamless access for clients at equitable, market-based prices. This approach significantly reduces the costs of accessing computing power, potentially to as low as 1% compared to existing services, while simultaneously enhancing security and dependability. The PinFi protocol is poised to transform the dynamics of supply and demand in computing power networks, setting a new standard for efficiency and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Urban Service Allocation with Time-Constrained Restless Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Municipal inspections are an important part of maintaining the quality of goods and services. In this paper, we approach the problem of intelligently scheduling service inspections to maximize their impact, using the case of food establishment inspections in Chicago as a case study. The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) inspects thousands of establishments each year, with a substantial fail rate (over 3,000 failed inspection reports in 2023). To balance the objectives of ensuring adherence to guidelines, minimizing disruption to establishments, and minimizing inspection costs, CDPH assigns each establishment an inspection window every year and guarantees that they will be inspected exactly once during that window. Meanwhile, CDPH also promises surprise public health inspections for unexpected food safety emergencies or complaints. These constraints create a challenge for a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) approach, for which there are no existing methods. We develop an extension to Whittle index-based systems for RMABs that can guarantee action window constraints and frequencies, and furthermore can be leveraged to optimize action window assignments themselves. Briefly, we combine MDP reformulation and integer programming-based lookahead to maximize the impact of inspections subject to constraints. A neural network-based supervised learning model is developed to model state transitions of real Chicago establishments using public CDPH inspection records, which demonstrates 10% AUC improvements compared with directly predicting establishments' failures. Our experiments not only show up to 24% (in simulation) or 33% (on real data) objective improvements resulting from our approach and robustness to surprise inspections, but also give insight into the impact of scheduling constraints.</description>

      <title>Graph topology estimation of power grids using pairwise mutual information of time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success is shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</description>

      <title>Novelty and Impact of Economics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework that recasts scientific novelty not as a single attribute of a paper, but as a reflection of its position within the evolving intellectual landscape. We decompose this position into two orthogonal dimensions: \textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual distinctiveness from its neighbors, and \textit{temporal novelty}, which captures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize these concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation metrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature. Applying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a fundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different outcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial novelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a typology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with distinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty can be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms, reflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally distinct consequences for scientific progress.</description>
