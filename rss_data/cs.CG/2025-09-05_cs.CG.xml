      <title>Optimizing alluvial plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alluvial plots can be effective for visualization of multivariate data, but rely on ordering of alluvia that can be non-trivial to arrange. We formulate two optimization problems that formalize the challenge of ordering and coloring partitions in alluvial plots. While solving these optimization problems is challenging in general, we show that the NeighborNet algorithm from phylogenetics can be adapted to provide excellent results in typical use cases. Our methods are implemented in a freely available R package available on GitHub at https://github.com/pachterlab/wompwomp</description>

      <title>Drawing Trees and Cacti with Integer Edge Lengths on a Polynomial-Size Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strengthened version of Harborth's well-known conjecture -- known as Kleber's conjecture -- states that every planar graph admits a planar straight-line drawing where every edge has integer length and each vertex is restricted to the integer grid. Positive results for Kleber's conjecture are known for planar 3-regular graphs, for planar graphs that have maximum degree 4, and for planar 3-trees. However, all but one of the existing results are existential and do not provide bounds on the required grid size. In this paper, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing crossing-free straight-line drawings of trees and cactus graphs with integer edge lengths and integer vertex position on polynomial-size integer grids.</description>

      <title>Bounding a Polygon by a Minimum Number of Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that a polygon $P$ is given as an array containing the vertices in counterclockwise order. We analyze how many vertices (including the index of each of these vertices) we need to know before we can bound $P$, i.e., report a bounded region $R$ in the plane such that $P\subset R$. We show that there exists polygons where $4\log_2 n+O(1)$ vertices are enough, while $\log_3n-o(\log n)$ must always be known. We thus answer the question up to a constant factor. This can be seen as an analysis of the shortest possible certificate or the best-case running time of any algorithm solving a variety of problems involving polygons, where a bound must be known in order to answer correctly. This includes various packing problems such as deciding whether a polygon can be contained inside another polygon.</description>

      <title>Memory Optimization for Convex Hull Support Point Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates several improvements to the memory layout of convex hulls to improve computation times for support point queries. The support point query is a fundamental part of common collision algorithms, and the work presented achieves a significant speedup depending on the number of vertices of the convex hull.</description>

      <title>Property Testing of Curve Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose sublinear algorithms for probabilistic testing of the discrete and continuous Fr\'echet distance - a standard similarity measure for curves. We assume the algorithm is given access to the input curves via a query oracle: a query returns the set of vertices of the curve that lie within a radius $\delta$ of a specified vertex of the other curve. The goal is to use a small number of queries to determine with constant probability whether the two curves are similar (i.e., their discrete Fr\'echet distance is at most $\delta$) or they are ''$\varepsilon$-far'' (for $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 2$) from being similar, i.e., more than an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the two curves must be ignored for them to become similar. We present two algorithms which are sublinear assuming that the curves are $t$-approximate shortest paths in the ambient metric space, for some $t\ll n$. The first algorithm uses $O(\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{t}{\varepsilon})$ queries and is given the value of $t$ in advance. The second algorithm does not have explicit knowledge of the value of $t$ and therefore needs to gain implicit knowledge of the straightness of the input curves through its queries. We show that the discrete Fr\'echet distance can still be tested using roughly $O(\frac{t^3+t^2\log n}{\varepsilon})$ queries ignoring logarithmic factors in $t$. Our algorithms work in a matrix representation of the input and may be of independent interest to matrix testing. Our algorithms use a mild uniform sampling condition that constrains the edge lengths of the curves, similar to a polynomially bounded aspect ratio. Applied to testing the continuous Fr\'echet distance of $t$-straight curves, our algorithms can be used for $(1+\varepsilon')$-approximate testing using essentially the same bounds as stated above with an additional factor of poly$(\frac{1}{\varepsilon'})$.</description>
