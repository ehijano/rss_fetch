      <title>Permutation Models Arising From Topological Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper by Zapletal arXiv:2404.10612 discusses permutation models of set theory which arise from dynamical ideals and highlights properties of the dynamical ideal which relate to fragments of choice in the permutation model. In this paper, we provide several examples from topology which illustrate using these connections to argue that the corresponding permutation model satisfies either the axiom of countable choice or well-ordered choice.</description>

      <title>Higher limits of wider systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Write $\mathbf{A}_\lambda$ for what might be described as the most elementary nontrivial inverse system of abelian groups indexed by the functions from the cardinal $\lambda$ to the set of natural numbers. The question of whether for any fixed $n$ the derived limit $\mathrm{lim}^n\,\mathbf{A}_\lambda$ may vanish for only a nonempty subset of the class of infinite cardinals $\lambda$ is recorded in both [Be17] and [Ban23], and bears closely on several related further ones. We answer this question in the affirmative; in fact, we show the maximal possibility, namely that this can simultaneously happen in every degree $n&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>A Proof Theory for Profinite Modal Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we showed that profinite $L$-algebras (where $L$ is a variety of modal algebras generated by its finite members) are monadic over $\mathbf{Set}$. This monadicity result suggests that profinite $L$-algebras could be presented as Lindenbaum algebras for propositional theories in infinitary versions of propositional modal calculi. In this paper we identify such calculi as modal enrichments of Maehara-Takeuti's infinitary extension of the sequent calculus $\mathbf{LK}$. We also investigate correspondences between syntactic properties of the calculi and regularity/exactness properties of the opposite category of profinite $L$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Dense and comeager conjugacy classes in zero-dimensional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group. We consider the Polish space of all actions of $G$ on the Cantor space by homeomorphisms and study the existence of a comeager conjugacy class in this space and some natural subspaces. We also develop a general model-theoretic framework to study this and related questions.
  We prove that for a finitely generated free group, there is a comeager conjugacy class in the space of minimal actions, as well as in the space of minimal, probability measure-preserving actions. We also identify the two classes: the first one is the Fra\"iss\'e limit of all sofic minimal subshifts and the second, the universal profinite action. In the opposite direction, if $G$ is an amenable group which is not finitely generated, we show that there is no comeager conjugacy class in the space of all actions and if $G$ is locally finite, also in the space of minimal actions.
  Finally, we study the question of existence of a dense conjugacy class in the space of topologically transitive actions. We show that if $G$ is free or virtually polycyclic, then such a dense conjugacy class exists iff $G$ is virtually cyclic.</description>

      <title>A note on the ineffectiveness of the regularity lemma for bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any $\Delta \geq 3$, there is no bound computable from $(\varepsilon, r)$ on the size of a graph required to approximate a graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ up to $\varepsilon$ error in $r$-neighborhood statistics. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by Lov\'asz. Our result is a direct consequence of the recent celebrated work of Bowen, Chapman, Lubotzky, and Vidick, which refutes the Aldous--Lyons conjecture.</description>
