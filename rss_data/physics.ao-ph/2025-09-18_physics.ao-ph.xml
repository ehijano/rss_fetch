      <title>Top- and bottom-heavy vertical velocity structures: physical modes of layered atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical East and West Pacific Oceans display differences in their vertical velocity (or omega) profiles. The East Pacific is characterized by bottom-heavy profiles, while the West Pacific is characterized by top-heavy profiles. Although inter-basin differences in the horizontal SST gradient are known to be important, physical reasons for why these omega structure variants exist are not fully understood. This question is addressed using a steady, linear model on an $f$-plane with $n$ atmospheric layers. Convection and radiation are parameterized as linear responses to thermodynamic perturbations with convective nonlinearity approximated by convection on/off regimes. The free (or eigen) modes of the model yield vertical structures resembling the observed baroclinic modes of the tropical atmosphere, with each mode associated with a characteristic horizontal scale (the eigenvalue). In the standard parameter regime, the first-baroclinic mode has a large spatial scale ($\sim$ 1500 km) while the second-baroclinic mode has a smaller spatial scale ($\sim$ 250 km). When the model is forced with a strong- and weak-gradient surface temperature ($T_s$) patterns, the resulting omega profiles assume bottom- and top-heavy structures respectively -- mimicking the observed differences between East and West Pacific Oceans. Additional dependence on the magnitude of the Coriolis force is also observed. The connection between the vertical structure and the horizontal scale of the baroclinic modes explains why a strong-gradient $T_s$ profile projects strongly onto the second-baroclinic mode yielding bottom-heavy omega profiles in the eastern Pacific, while a weak-gradient $T_s$ profile projects strongly onto the first-baroclinic mode, yielding top-heavy omega profiles typical of the Western Pacific.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Global Warming: End-to-End Visual Analysis and Prediction of Temperature Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global warming presents an unprecedented challenge to our planet however comprehensive understanding remains hindered by geographical biases temporal limitations and lack of standardization in existing research. An end to end visual analysis of global warming using three distinct temperature datasets is presented. A baseline adjusted from the Paris Agreements one point five degrees Celsius benchmark based on data analysis is employed. A closed loop design from visualization to prediction and clustering is created using classic models tailored to the characteristics of the data. This approach reduces complexity and eliminates the need for advanced feature engineering. A lightweight convolutional neural network and long short term memory model specifically designed for global temperature change is proposed achieving exceptional accuracy in long term forecasting with a mean squared error of three times ten to the power of negative six and an R squared value of zero point nine nine nine nine. Dynamic time warping and KMeans clustering elucidate national level temperature anomalies and carbon emission patterns. This comprehensive method reveals intricate spatiotemporal characteristics of global temperature variations and provides warming trend attribution. The findings offer new insights into climate change dynamics demonstrating that simplicity and precision can coexist in environmental analysis.</description>
