      <title>Organ Dose Equivalents of Albedo Protons and Neutrons Under Exposure to Large Solar Particle Events during Lunar Human Landing Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronauts participating in lunar landing missions will encounter exposure to albedo particles emitted from the lunar surface as well as primary high-energy particles in the spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar particle events (SPEs). While existing studies have examined particle energy spectra and absorbed doses in limited radiation exposure scenarios on and near the Moon, comprehensive research encompassing various shielding amounts and large SPEs on the lunar surface remains lacking. Additionally, detailed organ dose equivalents of albedo particles in a human model on the lunar surface have yet to be investigated. This work assesses the organ dose equivalents of albedo neutrons and protons during historically large SPEs in August 1972 and September 1989 utilizing realistic computational anthropomorphic human phantom for the first time. Dosimetric quantities within human organs have been evaluated based on the PHITS Monte Carlo simulation results and quality factors of the state-of-the-art NASA Space Cancer Risk (NSCR) model, as well as ICRP publications. The results with the NSCR model indicate that the albedo contribution to organ dose equivalent is less than 3% for 1 g/cm2 aluminum shielding, while it increases to more than 20% in some organs for 20 g/cm2 aluminum shielding during exposure to low-energy-proton-rich SPEs.</description>

      <title>Using sunRunner3D to interpret the global structure of the heliosphere from in situ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the large-scale three-dimensional structure of the inner heliosphere, while important in its own right, is crucial for space weather applications, such as forecasting the time of arrival and propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This study uses sunRunner3D (3D), a 3-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, to simulate solar wind (SW) streams and generate background states. SR3D employs the boundary conditions generated by CORona-HELiosphere (CORHEL) and the PLUTO code to compute the plasma properties of the SW with the MHD approximation up to 1.1 AU in the inner heliosphere. We demonstrate that SR3D reproduces global features of Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) observed by Earth-based spacecraft (OMNI) and the Solar TErrestial RElations Observatory (STEREO)-A for a set of Carrington rotations (CRs) that cover a period that lays in the late declining phase of solar cycle 24. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model solutions are valid in the corotating and inertial frames of references. Moreover, a comparison between SR3D simulations and in-situ measurements shows reasonable agreement with the observations, and our results are comparable to those achieved by Predictive Science Inc.'s Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code. We have also undertaken a comparative analysis with the Space Weather Adaptive Simulation Framework for Solar Wind (SWASTi-SW), a PLUTO physics-based model, to evaluate the precision of various initial boundary conditions. Finally, we discuss the disparities in the solutions derived from inertial and rotating frames.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Ion-Proton Differential Speed between ICMEs and Solar Wind near 1 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elemental abundance of ICMEs and solar wind near 1 au is often adopted to represent the abundance in the corresponding coronal sources. However, the absolute abundance of heavy ions (relative to hydrogen) near 1 au might be different from the coronal abundance due to the ion-proton differential speed ($V_{ip}$). To illustrate the $V_{ip}$ characteristics and explore whether it influences the absolute abundance analysis for ICMEs and solar wind, we perform a statistical study on the $V_{ip}$ for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, O$^{6+}$, and Fe$^{10+}$ in both ICMEs and solar wind based on measurements of Advanced Composition Explorer. The results show that the $V_{ip}$ is negligible within ICMEs and slow solar wind ($&lt;$ 400 km s$^{-1}$), while obvious in the intermediate (400 -- 600 km s$^{-1}$) and fast wind ($&gt;$ 600 km s$^{-1}$). Previous studies showed that the $V_{ip}$ in ICMEs keeps negligible during propagation from 0.3 to 5 au, but in solar wind it increases with the decreasing heliocentric distance. Therefore, it might be questionable to infer the absolute abundance of coronal sources through in-situ abundance near 1 au for solar wind. Fortunately, the ion-oxygen (O$^{6+}$) differential speed ($V_{io}$) is negligible for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, and Fe$^{10+}$ within both ICMEs and solar wind, and previous studies suggested that the $V_{io}$ does not vary significantly with the heliocentric distance. This indicates that various heavy ions always flow at the same bulk speed and their relative abundance (relative to oxygen) near 1 au can represent the coronal abundance for both ICMEs and solar wind.</description>
