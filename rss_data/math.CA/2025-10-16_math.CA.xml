      <title>A Tribute to Richard Askey, and an Expansive View of Some of his Favorite Beta Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article represents a personal tribute to Richard Askey together with a new look at some of his favorite integrals, including the Cauchy beta integral. The article also provides some new multidimensional extensions of Cauchy's beta integral in which the domain of integration is the space of real symmetric matrices, and these multidimensional integrals are used to obtain some special cases of the Cauchy--Selberg integrals.</description>

      <title>Continuous nowhere differentiable multivariate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be an open set in $\mathbb{R}^d$. A continuous function $f\colon U \to \mathbb{R}$ is strongly nowhere differentiable if and only if for each $\gamma\in(0,1]$ and for each unit speed $C^{1,\gamma}$ curve $c\colon [a,b] \to U$, the composition $f\circ c \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is nowhere differentiable on $(a,b)$. For bounded $U$, let $\overline U$ be the closure of $U$ and $C(\overline U)$ be the Banach space of continuous real-valued functions on $\overline U$ with the sup norm. Theorem. In the sense of the Baire category theorem, almost every $f\in C(\overline U)$ is strongly nowhere differentiable on $U$.</description>

      <title>The radius of starlikeness of regular Coulomb wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the pioneering work of M.S. Robertson [Ro54] and R.K. Brown [Br60], [Br62], who examined the geometric properties of some normalised solutions of second-order homogeneous differential equations, in this paper we investigate the radii of univalence and starlikeness for two kind of normalised regular Coulomb wave functions. Moreover, a generalized normalised Bessel function is introduced, and its radius of starlikeness is studied by using two different approaches. In addition, the asymptotic behaviour, with respect to the large order, of the radius of starlikeness of one type of normalised Coulomb wave functions is considered, which is in fact the first zero of the derivative of the regular Coulomb wave function. We derive a complete asymptotic expansion for this radius of starlikeness and provide a recurrence relation for the coefficients of this expansion. The proof is based on Rayleigh sums of the zeros of Coulomb wave functions, asymptotic inversion and some basic results on regular Coulomb wave functions developed by \v{S}tampach and \v{S}\'{t}ov\'{\i}\v{c}ek [SS14].</description>

      <title>Using quasi-Darboux transformations to construct exceptional matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a couple of methods to construct exceptional matrix polynomials. One of them uses what we have called quasi-Darboux transformations. This seems to be a more powerful method to deal with the non-commutativity problems that appear when matrix-valued polynomials are considered. The other method does not use any transformation of Darboux type. Using both methods, we construct a collection of five illustrative examples that show how powerful our two methods are. The examples include exceptional matrix polynomials of Hermite, Laguerre, and Gegenbauer type, as well as an example with a weight matrix having a Dirac delta.</description>

      <title>Uvarov Perturbations for Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials of the Mixed Type on the Step-Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uvarov-type perturbations for mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials on the step line are investigated within a matrix-analytic framework. The transformations considered involve both rational and additive modifications of a rectangular matrix of measures, implemented through left and right multiplication by regular matrix polynomials together with the addition of finitely many discrete matrix masses. These operations induce structured finite-band modifications of the corresponding moment matrix and rational transformations of the associated Markov-Stieltjes matrix function. Explicit Uvarov-type connection formulas are obtained, relating the perturbed and unperturbed families of mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomials, and determinant conditions ensuring the existence of the new orthogonality are established. The algebraic consequences of these transformations are analyzed, showing their effect on the structure of the block-banded recurrence operators and on the spectral data encoded in the Markov-Stieltjes matrix functions. As an illustrative example, nontrivial Uvarov-type perturbations of the Jacobi-Pi\~neiro multiple orthogonal polynomials are presented. The results unify Christoffel, Geronimus, and Uvarov transformations within a single matrix framework, providing a linear-algebraic perspective on rational and additive spectral transformations of structured moment matrices and their corresponding recurrence operators.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ averages of the discrete Fourier transform and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete Fourier transform has proven to be an essential tool in many geometric and combinatorial problems in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform appear more `random' and are easier to analyze. However, there is a trade-off: in many cases, obtaining good uniform bounds is not possible, even in situations where many points satisfy strong pointwise bounds. To address this limitation, the first named author proposed an approach where one attempts to replace the need for uniform ($L^\infty$) bounds with suitable bounds for the $L^p$ average of the Fourier transform. In subsequent joint work, the authors applied this approach successfully to improve known results in Fourier restriction and the study of orthogonal projections. In this survey we discuss this general approach, give several examples, and exhibit some of the recent applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing rectifiability via biLipschitz pieces of Lipschitz mappings on the space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the following characterization of rectifiable metric spaces. A metric space with positive lower Hausdorff density is rectifiable if and only if, for any subset $F$ and $f:F\to Y$, a Lipschitz map into a metric space with positive measure image (of the same dimension), there exists a positive measure subset $A\subset F$ so that $f$ is biLipschitz on $A$. We also give a characterization in terms of a full biLipschitz decomposition. These characterizations are new even for subsets of Euclidean space.
  One of our tools is Alberti representations. On the way we give a method for constructing independent Alberti representations, which may be of independent interest. We use this to characterize unrectifiable metric spaces as those spaces for which there exist a positive measure subset $S$ and a Lipschitz map $\phi$ into a lower dimensional Euclidean space so that $S$ is $\cH^1$-null with respect to all curve fragments that are quantitatively transversal to $\phi$.</description>

      <title>Computation of minimal periods for ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the shortest possible period for an exactly periodic solution to some given autonomous ordinary differential equation. We show that, given a pair of Lyapunov-like observable functions defined over the state space of the corresponding dynamical system and satisfying a certain pointwise inequality, we can obtain a global lower bound for such periods. We give a method valid for the case of bounding the period of only those solutions which are invariant under a symmetry transformation, as well as bounds for general periodic orbits. If the governing equations are polynomial in the state variables, we can use semidefinite programming to find such auxiliary functions computationally, and thus compute lower bounds which can be rigorously validated using rational arithmetic. We apply our method to the Lorenz and Henon-Heiles systems. For both systems we are able to give validated bounds which are sharp to several decimal places.</description>

      <title>On the energy image density conjecture of Bouleau and Hirsch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We affirmatively resolve the energy image density conjecture of Bouleau and Hirsch (1986). Beyond the original framework of Dirichlet structures, we establish the energy image density property in several related settings. In particular, we formulate a version of the property that encompasses strongly local, regular Dirichlet forms, Sobolev spaces defined via upper gradients, and self-similar energies on fractals, thereby unifying these under a single framework. As applications, we prove the finiteness of the martingale dimension for diffusions satisfying sub-Gaussian heat kernel bounds, and we obtain a new proof of a conjecture of Cheeger concerning the Hausdorff dimension of the images of differentiability charts in PI spaces. The proof of the energy image density property is based on a structure theorem for measures and normal currents in $\mathbb{R}^n$ due to De Philippis--Rindler, together with the notions of decomposability bundles due to Alberti--Marchese and cone null sets due to Alberti--Cs\"ornyei--Preiss and Bate.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Bounds for List Recovery via Discrete Brascamp--Lieb Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In coding theory, the problem of list recovery asks one to find all codewords $c$ of a given code $C$ which such that at least $1-\rho$ fraction of the symbols of $c$ lie in some predetermined set of $\ell$ symbols for each coordinate of the code. A key question is bounding the maximum possible list size $L$ of such codewords for the given code $C$.
  In this paper, we give novel combinatorial bounds on the list recoverability of various families of linear and folded linear codes, including random linear codes, random Reed--Solomon codes, explicit folded Reed--Solomon codes, and explicit univariate multiplicity codes. Our main result is that in all of these settings, we show that for code of rate $R$, when $\rho = 1 - R - \epsilon$ approaches capacity, the list size $L$ is at most $(\ell/(R+\epsilon))^{O(R/\epsilon)}$. These results also apply in the average-radius regime. Our result resolves a long-standing open question on whether $L$ can be bounded by a polynomial in $\ell$. In the zero-error regime, our bound on $L$ perfectly matches known lower bounds.
  The primary technique is a novel application of a discrete entropic Brascamp--Lieb inequality to the problem of list recovery, allowing us to relate the local structure of each coordinate with the global structure of the recovered list. As a result of independent interest, we show that a recent result by Chen and Zhang (STOC 2025) on the list decodability of folded Reed--Solomon codes can be generalized into a novel Brascamp--Lieb type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop lower bounds for the energy of configurations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ periodic with respect to a lattice. In certain cases, the construction of sharp bounds can be formulated as a finite dimensional, multivariate polynomial interpolation problem. We use this framework to show a scaling of the equitriangular lattice $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_4+ A_2$ where $\omega_4$ is a 4-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Likewise, we show a scaling and rotation of $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_6+L$ where $\omega_6$ is a 6-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $L=\mathbb{Z} \times \sqrt{3} \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials of arbitrary size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly provide expressions for a sequence of orthogonal polynomials associated with a weight matrix of size $N$ constructed from a collection of scalar weights $w_{1}, \ldots, w_{N}$:
  $$W(x) = T(x)\operatorname{diag}(w_{1}(x), \ldots, w_{N}(x))T(x)^{\ast},$$
  where $T(x)$ is a specific polynomial matrix. We provide sufficient conditions on the scalar weights to ensure that the weight matrix $W$ is irreducible. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions on the scalar weights to ensure the constructed sequence of matrix orthogonal polynomials is an eigenfunction of a differential operator. We also study the Darboux transformations and bispectrality of the orthogonal polynomials in the particular case where the scalar weights are the classical weights of Jacobi, Hermite, and Laguerre.
  With these results, we construct a wide variety of bispectral matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials of arbitrary size, which satisfy a second-order differential equation.</description>

      <title>On the dimension distortion under fractionally smooth mappings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the extent to which certain classes of fractionally `smooth' continuous mappings between metric spaces distort various dimensions, including the Hausdorff, upper Minkowski (box-counting), and upper intermediate dimensions. Our intermediate and Minkowski dimension distortion results are new even for continuous (fractional) Sobolev and, more generally, Triebel--Lizorkin and Besov mappings between Euclidean spaces, complementing the work of Hencl-Honz\'ik (2015) and Huynh (2022). Moreover, our results also extend the aforementioned work, as well as the work of Kaufman (2000) and Fraser-Tyson (2025) to certain weighted Euclidean spaces and, more generally, to doubling metric measure spaces. As an application of our main result, we quantify the corresponding dimension distortion properties of quasisymmetric mappings for non-Ahlfors regular subsets of metric measure spaces, strengthening a result of Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams (2016).</description>

      <title>Properties of generalized Jacobi elliptic functions with three parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jacobi elliptic functions and complete elliptic integrals are generalized using three parameters. These generalized functions and integrals are closely related to ordinary differential equations involving $p$-Laplacian. In this paper, Wallis-type integral formulae are constructed for the generalized Jacobi elliptic functions. Moreover, for the generalized complete elliptic integrals, a Legendre-type relation is derived, which is equivalent to Elliott's identity for Gaussian hypergeometric series, along with its implications. In addition, nontrivial inequalities on binomial expansions of generalized Jacobi elliptic functions are given.</description>

      <title>Symplectic model order reduction of port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel structure-preserving model order reduction (MOR) method for linear, time-invariant port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems. Our goal is to construct a reduced order pH system, which can still be interpreted in the physical domain of the full order model. By this we mean, that if an electrical circuit is the initial high-dimensional pH system, we want the reduced order model to be still interpretable as an electronic circuit. In the case of the well-known mass spring damper (MSD) system, there are MOR methods available, which already guarantee the preservation of this particular structure. Moreover, we show that our new structure-preserving MOR method, which is based on symplectic MOR methods, will recover the known second-order Arnoldi method in the case of MSD systems. However, for the example of an electrical circuit pH model (and more models of similar block structure), our method yields a novel model reduction method. We present numerical results on the aforementioned electronic circuit model, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of periodic fractional discrete NLS in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fDNLS) is studied on a periodic lattice from the analytic and dynamic perspective by varying the mesh size $h&gt;0$ and the nonlocal L\'evy index $\alpha \in (0,2]$. We show that the discrete system converges to the fractional NLS as $h \rightarrow 0$ below the energy space by directly estimating the difference between the discrete and continuum solutions in $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ using the discrete periodic Strichartz estimates. The sharp convergence rate via the finite difference method (FDM) is shown to be $O(h^{\frac{\alpha}{2+\alpha}})$ in the energy space. To further illustrate the convergent behavior of fDNLS, we survey various dynamical behaviors of the continuous wave (CW) solutions in the context of modulational instability, emphasizing the interplay between linear dispersion (or lattice diffraction), characterized by the nonlocal lattice coupling, and nonlinearity. In particular, the transition as $h \rightarrow 0$ from the linear dependence of maximum gain $\Omega_m$ on the amplitude $A$ of CW solutions to the quadratic dependence is shown analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear excitations in multi-dimensional nonlocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of breathers in multi-dimensional lattices with long-range interactions. By variational methods, the exact relationship between various parameters (dimension, nonlinearity, nonlocal parameter $\alpha$) that defines positive excitation thresholds is characterized. We establish a sharp mass-threshold dichotomy: no positive threshold in the mass-subcritical regime, and a strictly positive threshold at and above the critical regime. In the anti-continuum regime, a family of unique ground states characterizes the excitation thresholds, enabling explicit computations. Analytic formulas of the excitation thresholds, determined by the ground states, are derived and corroborated with numerical simulations. We not only characterize the sharp spatial decay of ground states, which varies continuously in $\alpha$, but also identify the time decay of dispersive waves, which undergoes a discontinuous transition in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>How smooth are restrictions of Besov functions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that Besov spaces do not enjoy the restriction property unless $q\leq p$. Specifically, we proved that if $p&lt;q$, then it is always possible to construct a function $f\in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ such that $f(\cdot,y)\notin B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for a.e. $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}$, while this "pathology" does not happen if $q\leq p$. We showed that the partial maps belong, in fact, to the Besov space of generalised smoothness $B_{p,q}^{(s,\Psi)}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ provided the function $\Psi$ satisfies a simple summability condition involving $p$ and $q$. This short note completes the picture by showing that this characterisation is sharp.</description>
