      <title>The Voice of Equity: A Systematic Evaluation of Bias Mitigation Techniques for Speech-Based Cognitive Impairment Detection Across Architectures and Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-based detection of cognitive impairment offers a scalable, non-invasive screening, yet algorithmic bias across demographic and linguistic subgroups remains critically underexplored. We present the first comprehensive fairness analysis framework for speech-based multi-class cognitive impairment detection, systematically evaluating bias mitigation across architectures, and demographic subgroups. We developed two transformer-based architectures, SpeechCARE-AGF and Whisper-LWF-LoRA, on the multilingual NIA PREPARE Challenge dataset. Unlike prior work that typically examines single mitigation techniques, we compared pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing approaches, assessing fairness via Equality of Opportunity and Equalized Odds across gender, age, education, and language. Both models achieved strong performance (F1: SpeechCARE-AGF 70.87, Whisper-LWF-LoRA 71.46) but exhibited substantial fairness disparities. Adults &gt;=80 showed lower sensitivity versus younger groups; Spanish speakers demonstrated reduced TPR versus English speakers. Mitigation effectiveness varied by architecture: oversampling improved SpeechCARE-AGF for older adults (80+ TPR: 46.19%=&gt;49.97%) but minimally affected Whisper-LWF-LoRA. This study addresses a critical healthcare AI gap by demonstrating that architectural design fundamentally shapes bias patterns and mitigation effectiveness. Adaptive fusion mechanisms enable flexible responses to data interventions, while frequency reweighting offers robust improvements across architectures. Our findings establish that fairness interventions must be tailored to both model architecture and demographic characteristics, providing a systematic framework for developing equitable speech-based screening tools essential for reducing diagnostic disparities in cognitive healthcare.</description>

      <title>BickGraphing: Web-Based Application for Visual Inspection of Audio Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BickGraphing is a browser based research tool that enables visual inspection of acoustic recordings. The tool was built in support of visualizing crop feeding pest sounds in support of the Insect Eavesdropper project; however, it is widely applicable to all audiovisualizations in research. It allows multiple uploads of large .wav files, computes waveforms and spectrograms locally, and supports interactive exploration of audio events in time and frequency. The application is implemented as a SvelteKit and TypeScript web app with a client side signal processing pipeline using WebAssembly compiled FFmpeg and custom FFT utilities. The software is released on an open Git repository (https://github.com/bicklabuw/BickGraphing) and archived under a standard MIT license and can be reused for rapid visual quality checks of .wav recordings in insect bioacoustics and related fields. BickGraphing has the potential to be a local, easy to use coding free visualization platform for audio data in research.</description>

      <title>PC-MCL: Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning with multi-label bias correction for respiratory sound classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated respiratory sound classification supports the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. However, many deep models still rely on cycle-level analysis and suffer from patient-specific overfitting. We propose PC-MCL (Patient-Consistent Multi-Cycle Learning) to address these limitations by utilizing three key components: multi-cycle concatenation, a 3-label formulation, and a patient-matching auxiliary task. Our work resolves a multi-label distributional bias in respiratory sound classification, a critical issue inherent to applying multi-cycle concatenation with the conventional 2-label formulation (crackle, wheeze). This bias manifests as a systematic loss of normal signal information when normal and abnormal cycles are combined. Our proposed 3-label formulation (normal, crackle, wheeze) corrects this by preserving information from all constituent cycles in mixed samples. Furthermore, the patient-matching auxiliary task acts as a multi-task regularizer, encouraging the model to learn more robust features and improving generalization. On the ICBHI 2017 benchmark, PC-MCL achieves an ICBHI Score of 65.37%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that all three components are essential, working synergistically to improve the detection of abnormal respiratory events.</description>

      <title>Recovering Performance in Speech Emotion Recognition from Discrete Tokens via Multi-Layer Fusion and Paralinguistic Feature Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete speech tokens offer significant advantages for storage and language model integration, but their application in speech emotion recognition (SER) is limited by paralinguistic information loss during quantization. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of discrete tokens for SER. Using a fine-tuned WavLM-Large model, we systematically quantify performance degradation across different layer configurations and k-means quantization granularities. To recover the information loss, we propose two key strategies: (1) attention-based multi-layer fusion to recapture complementary information from different layers, and (2) integration of openSMILE features to explicitly reintroduce paralinguistic cues. We also compare mainstream neural codec tokenizers (SpeechTokenizer, DAC, EnCodec) and analyze their behaviors when fused with acoustic features. Our findings demonstrate that through multi-layer fusion and acoustic feature integration, discrete tokens can close the performance gap with continuous representations in SER tasks.</description>

      <title>Spoofing-Aware Speaker Verification via Wavelet Prompt Tuning and Multi-Model Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the UZH-CL system submitted to the SASV section of the WildSpoof 2026 challenge. The challenge focuses on the integrated defense against generative spoofing attacks by requiring the simultaneous verification of speaker identity and audio authenticity. We proposed a cascaded Spoofing-Aware Speaker Verification framework that integrates a Wavelet Prompt-Tuned XLSR-AASIST countermeasure with a multi-model ensemble. The ASV component utilizes the ResNet34, ResNet293, and WavLM-ECAPA-TDNN architectures, with Z-score normalization followed by score averaging. Trained on VoxCeleb2 and SpoofCeleb, the system obtained a Macro a-DCF of 0.2017 and a SASV EER of 2.08%. While the system achieved a 0.16% EER in spoof detection on the in-domain data, results on unseen datasets, such as the ASVspoof5, highlight the critical challenge of cross-domain generalization.</description>

      <title>ToS: A Team of Specialists ensemble framework for Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with distance estimation in Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection with distance estimation (3D SELD) in video involves identifying active sound events at each time frame while estimating their spatial coordinates. This multimodal task requires joint reasoning across semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions, a challenge that single models often struggle to address effectively. To tackle this, we introduce the Team of Specialists (ToS) ensemble framework, which integrates three complementary sub-networks: a spatio-linguistic model, a spatio-temporal model, and a tempo-linguistic model. Each sub-network specializes in a unique pair of dimensions, contributing distinct insights to the final prediction, akin to a collaborative team with diverse expertise. ToS has been benchmarked against state-of-the-art audio-visual models for 3D SELD on the DCASE2025 Task 3 Stereo SELD development set, consistently outperforming existing methods across key metrics. Future work will extend this proof of concept by strengthening the specialists with appropriate tasks, training, and pre-training curricula.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Joint ASR and Speaker Role Diarization with Child-Adult Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate transcription and speaker diarization of child-adult spoken interactions are crucial for developmental and clinical research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and challenging to scale. Existing automated systems typically rely on cascaded speaker diarization and speech recognition pipelines, which can lead to error propagation. This paper presents a unified end-to-end framework that extends the Whisper encoder-decoder architecture to jointly model ASR and child-adult speaker role diarization. The proposed approach integrates: (i) a serialized output training scheme that emits speaker tags and start/end timestamps, (ii) a lightweight frame-level diarization head that enhances speaker-discriminative encoder representations, (iii) diarization-guided silence suppression for improved temporal precision, and (iv) a state-machine-based forced decoding procedure that guarantees structurally valid outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on two datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over two cascaded baselines, achieving lower multi-talker word error rates and demonstrating competitive diarization accuracy across both Whisper-small and Whisper-large models. These findings highlight the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed joint modeling framework for generating reliable, speaker-attributed transcripts of child-adult interactions at scale. The code and model weights are publicly available</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) plays a pivotal role in understanding human communication, enabling emotionally intelligent systems, and serving as a fundamental component in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, deploying SER in real-world, spontaneous, and low-resource scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of emotional expression and the limitations of current speech and language technologies. This thesis investigates the integration of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) into SER, with the goal of enhancing the robustness, scalability, and practical applicability of emotion recognition from spoken language.</description>

      <title>AmbER$^2$: Dual Ambiguity-Aware Emotion Recognition Applied to Speech and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is inherently ambiguous, with uncertainty arising both from rater disagreement and from discrepancies across modalities such as speech and text. There is growing interest in modeling rater ambiguity using label distributions. However, modality ambiguity remains underexplored, and multimodal approaches often rely on simple feature fusion without explicitly addressing conflicts between modalities. In this work, we propose AmbER$^2$, a dual ambiguity-aware framework that simultaneously models rater-level and modality-level ambiguity through a teacher-student architecture with a distribution-wise training objective. Evaluations on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that AmbER$^2$ consistently improves distributional fidelity over conventional cross-entropy baselines and achieves performance competitive with, or superior to, recent state-of-the-art systems. For example, on IEMOCAP, AmbER$^2$ achieves relative improvements of 20.3% on Bhattacharyya coefficient (0.83 vs. 0.69), 13.6% on R$^2$ (0.67 vs. 0.59), 3.8% on accuracy (0.683 vs. 0.658), and 4.5% on F1 (0.675 vs. 0.646). Further analysis across ambiguity levels shows that explicitly modeling ambiguity is particularly beneficial for highly uncertain samples. These findings highlight the importance of jointly addressing rater and modality ambiguity when building robust emotion recognition systems.</description>

      <title>SpatialEmb: Extract and Encode Spatial Information for 1-Stage Multi-channel Multi-speaker ASR on Arbitrary Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial information is a critical clue for multi-channel multi-speaker target speech recognition. Most state-of-the-art multi-channel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems extract spatial features only during the speech separation stage, followed by standard single-channel ASR on the separated speech. This approach results in an inefficient, lengthy pipeline and sub-optimal ASR performance due to the accumulated errors from preprocessing modules. Furthermore, most spatial feature extraction methods depend on the knowledge of speaker positions and microphone topology, making the systems reliant on specific settings and challenging to adapt to new equipment. In this work, we propose a solution to these issues with a lightweight embedding module named SpatialEmb, which extracts and encodes spatial information directly for the ASR model, supporting both fixed and arbitrary microphone topology. We conduct comprehensive experiments on AliMeeting, a real meeting corpus, to determine the optimal model design for SpatialEmb in terms of both performance and efficiency. Our best model trained with 105 hours Train-Ali-far achieves 17.04% and 20.32% character error rates (CER) on the Eval and Test sets, establishing a new state-of-the-art result with the same training data.</description>

      <title>OneVoice: One Model, Triple Scenarios-Towards Unified Zero-shot Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress of voice conversion~(VC) has achieved a new milestone in speaker cloning and linguistic preservation. But the field remains fragmented, relying on specialized models for linguistic-preserving, expressive, and singing scenarios. We propose OneVoice, a unified zero-shot framework capable of handling all three scenarios within a single model. OneVoice is built upon a continuous language model trained with VAE-free next-patch diffusion, ensuring high fidelity and efficient sequence modeling. Its core design for unification lies in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designed to explicitly model shared conversion knowledge and scenario-specific expressivity. Expert selection is coordinated by a dual-path routing mechanism, including shared expert isolation and scenario-aware domain expert assignment with global-local cues. For precise conditioning, scenario-specific prosodic features are fused into each layer via a gated mechanism, allowing adaptive usage of prosody information. Furthermore, to enable the core idea and alleviate the imbalanced issue (abundant speech vs. scarce singing), we adopt a two-stage progressive training that includes foundational pre-training and scenario enhancement with LoRA-based domain experts. Experiments show that OneVoice matches or surpasses specialized models across all three scenarios, while verifying flexible control over scenarios and offering a fast decoding version as few as 2 steps. Code and model will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Efficient Rehearsal for Continual Learning in ASR via Singular Value Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) suffers from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks, domains, or speakers. A common strategy to mitigate this is to store a subset of past data in memory for rehearsal. However, rehearsal-based methods face key limitations: storing data is often costly, infeasible with pre-trained models, or restricted by privacy regulations. Running existing rehearsal-based methods with smaller memory sizes to alleviate these issues usually leads to degraded performance.
  We propose a rehearsal-based CL method that remains effective even with minimal memory. It operates in two stages: first, fine-tuning on the new task; second, applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the changes in linear layers and, in a parameter-efficient manner, retraining only gating vectors on the singular values, which control to extent to which updates from the first stage are accepted, using rehearsal. We extensively test and analyze our method on two monolingual and two multilingual benchmarks. Our method reduces forgetting and outperforms state-of-the-art CL approaches for ASR, even when limited to a single utterance per previous task.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Contrastive Learning with an MFCC-Conformer For Coronary Artery Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide, with coronary artery disease (CAD) comprising the largest subcategory of CVDs. Recently, there has been increased focus on detecting CAD using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, with high success in clinical environments with low noise and optimal sensor placement. Multichannel techniques have been found to be more robust to noise; however, achieving robust performance on real-world data remains a challenge. This work utilises a novel multichannel energy-based noisy-segment rejection algorithm, using heart and noise-reference microphones, to discard audio segments with large amounts of nonstationary noise before training a deep learning classifier. This conformer-based classifier takes mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from multiple channels, further helping improve the model's noise robustness. The proposed method achieved 78.4% accuracy and 78.2% balanced accuracy on 297 subjects, representing improvements of 4.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to training without noisy-segment rejection.</description>

      <title>Residual Learning for Neural Ambisonics Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging wearable devices such as smartglasses and extended reality headsets demand high-quality spatial audio capture from compact, head-worn microphone arrays. Ambisonics provides a device-agnostic spatial audio representation by mapping array signals to spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. In practice, however, accurate encoding remains challenging. While traditional linear encoders are signal-independent and robust, they amplify low-frequency noise and suffer from high-frequency spatial aliasing. On the other hand, neural network approaches can outperform linear encoders but they often assume idealized microphones and may perform inconsistently in real-world scenarios. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce a residual-learning framework that refines a linear encoder with corrections from a neural network. Using measured array transfer functions from smartglasses, we compare a UNet-based encoder from the literature with a new recurrent attention model. Our analysis reveals that both neural encoders only consistently outperform the linear baseline when integrated within the residual learning framework. In the residual configuration, both neural models achieve consistent and significant improvements across all tested metrics for in-domain data and moderate gains for out-of-domain data. Yet, coherence analysis indicates that all neural encoder configurations continue to struggle with directionally accurate high-frequency encoding.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust AV-ASR Using Visual Features Both in the Whisper Encoder and Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In audiovisual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) systems, information fusion of visual features in a pre-trained ASR has been proven as a promising method to improve noise robustness. In this work, based on the prominent Whisper ASR, first, we propose a simple and effective visual fusion method -- use of visual features both in encoder and decoder (dual-use) -- to learn the audiovisual interactions in the encoder and to weigh modalities in the decoder. Second, we compare visual fusion methods in Whisper models of various sizes. Our proposed dual-use method shows consistent noise robustness improvement, e.g., a 35% relative improvement (WER: 4.41% vs. 6.83%) based on Whisper small, and a 57% relative improvement (WER: 4.07% vs. 9.53%) based on Whisper medium, compared to typical reference middle fusion in babble noise with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0dB. Third, we conduct ablation studies examining the impact of various module designs and fusion options. Fine-tuned on 1929 hours of audiovisual data, our dual-use method using Whisper medium achieves 4.08% (MUSAN babble noise) and 4.43% (NoiseX babble noise) average WER across various SNRs, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art in noisy conditions on the LRS3 AV-ASR benchmark.

      <title>Audio Inpainting in Time-Frequency Domain with Phase-Aware Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called audio inpainting problem in the time domain refers to estimating missing segments of samples within a signal. Over the years, several methods have been developed for such type of audio inpainting. In contrast to this case, a time-frequency variant of inpainting appeared in the literature, where the challenge is to reconstruct missing spectrogram columns with reliable information. We propose a method to address this time-frequency audio inpainting problem. Our approach is based on the recently introduced phase-aware signal prior that exploits an estimate of the instantaneous frequency. An optimization problem is formulated and solved using the generalized Chambolle-Pock algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated both objectively and subjectively against other time-frequency inpainting methods, specifically a deep-prior neural network and the autoregression-based approach known as Janssen-TF. Our proposed approach surpassed these methods in the objective evaluation as well as in the conducted listening test. Moreover, this outcome is achieved with a substantially reduced computational requirement compared to alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Discover: A Generalized Framework for Raga Identification without Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raga identification in Indian Art Music (IAM) remains challenging due to the presence of numerous rarely performed Ragas that are not represented in available training datasets. Traditional classification models struggle in this setting, as they assume a closed set of known categories and therefore fail to recognise or meaningfully group previously unseen Ragas. Recent works have tried categorizing unseen Ragas, but they run into a problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the knowledge of previously seen Ragas is diminished. To address this problem, we adopt a unified learning framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled audio, enabling the model to discover coherent categories corresponding to the unseen Ragas, while retaining the knowledge of previously known ones. We test our model on benchmark Raga Identification datasets and demonstrate its performance in categorizing previously seen, unseen, and all Raga classes. The proposed approach surpasses the previous NCD-based pipeline even in discovering the unseen Raga categories, offering new insights into representation learning for IAM tasks.</description>

      <title>SonoEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Pronunciation Correction in LLM-Based TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems systematically mispronounce low-resource proper nouns, particularly non-English names, brands, and geographic locations, due to their underrepresentation in predominantly English training corpora. Existing solutions typically rely on expensive multilingual data collection, supervised finetuning, or manual phonetic annotation, which limits the deployment of TTS systems in linguistically diverse settings. We introduce SonoEdit, a model editing technique that surgically corrects pronunciation errors in pre-trained TTS models without retraining. Instead of costly finetuning or explicit phoneme injection, we propose a parsimonious alternative based on Null-Space Pronunciation Editing, which performs a single-shot parameter update to modify the pronunciation of specific words while provably preserving all other model behavior. We first adapt Acoustic Causal Tracing to identify the Transformer layers responsible for text-to-pronunciation mapping. We then apply Null-Space Constrained Editing to compute a closed-form weight update that corrects the target pronunciation while remaining mathematically orthogonal to the subspace governing general speech generation. This constrained update steers the model's acoustic output toward a desired pronunciation exemplar while guaranteeing zero first-order change on a preserved speech corpus.</description>

      <title>Sink or SWIM: Tackling Real-Time ASR at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time automatic speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into interactive applications, from voice assistants to live transcription services. However, scaling these systems to support multiple concurrent clients while maintaining low latency and high accuracy remains a major challenge. In this work, we present SWIM, a novel real-time ASR system built on top of OpenAI's Whisper model that enables true model-level parallelization for scalable, multilingual transcription. SWIM supports multiple concurrent audio streams without modifying the underlying model. It introduces a buffer merging strategy that maintains transcription fidelity while ensuring efficient resource usage. We evaluate SWIM in multi-client settings -- scaling up to 20 concurrent users -- and show that it delivers accurate real-time transcriptions in English, Italian, and Spanish, while maintaining low latency and high throughput. While Whisper-Streaming achieves a word error rate of approximately 8.2% with an average delay of approximately 3.4 s in a single-client, English-only setting, SWIM extends this capability to multilingual, multi-client environments. It maintains comparable accuracy with significantly lower delay -- around 2.4 s with 5 clients -- and continues to scale effectively up to 20 concurrent clients without degrading transcription quality and increasing overall throughput. Our approach advances scalable ASR by improving robustness and efficiency in dynamic, multi-user environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) plays a vital role in enabling applications such as speech recognition. We analyze the impact of window size on the accuracy of three VAD algorithms: Silero, WebRTC, and Root Mean Square (RMS) across a set of diverse real-world digital audio streams. We additionally explore the use of hysteresis on top of each VAD output. Our results offer practical references for optimizing VAD systems. Silero significantly outperforms WebRTC and RMS, and hysteresis provides a benefit for WebRTC.</description>

      <title>EuleroDec: A Complex-Valued RVQ-VAE for Efficient and Robust Audio Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio codecs power discrete music generative modelling, music streaming, and immersive media by shrinking PCM audio to bandwidth-friendly bitrates. Recent works have gravitated towards processing in the spectral domain; however, spectrogram domains typically struggle with phase modeling, which is naturally complex-valued. Most frequency-domain neural codecs either disregard phase information or encode it as two separate real-valued channels, limiting spatial fidelity. This entails the need to introduce adversarial discriminators at the expense of convergence speed and training stability to compensate for the inadequate representation power of the audio signal. In this work we introduce an end-to-end complex-valued RVQ-VAE audio codec that preserves magnitude-phase coupling across the entire analysis-quantization-synthesis pipeline and removes adversarial discriminators and diffusion post-filters. Without GANs or diffusion, we match or surpass much longer-trained baselines in-domain and reach SOTA out-of-domain performance on phase coherence and waveform fidelity. Compared to standard baselines that train for hundreds of thousands of steps, our model, which reduces the training budget by an order of magnitude, is markedly more compute-efficient while preserving high perceptual quality.</description>

Abstract: To support aging-in-place, adult children often provide care to their aging parents from a distance. These informal caregivers desire plug-and-play remote care solutions for privacy-preserving continuous monitoring that enabling real-time activity monitoring and intuitive, actionable information. This short paper presents insights from three iterations of deployment experience for remote monitoring system and the iterative improvement in hardware, modeling, and user interface guided by the Geriatric 4Ms framework (matters most, mentation, mobility, and medication). An LLM-assisted solution is developed to balance user experience (privacy-preserving, plug-and-play) and system performance.</description>

      <title>AVMeme Exam: A Multimodal Multilingual Multicultural Benchmark for LLMs' Contextual and Cultural Knowledge and Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet audio-visual clips convey meaning through time-varying sound and motion, which extend beyond what text alone can represent. To examine whether AI models can understand such signals in human cultural contexts, we introduce AVMeme Exam, a human-curated benchmark of over one thousand iconic Internet sounds and videos spanning speech, songs, music, and sound effects. Each meme is paired with a unique Q&amp;A assessing levels of understanding from surface content to context and emotion to usage and world knowledge, along with metadata such as original year, transcript, summary, and sensitivity. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) alongside human participants using this benchmark. Our results reveal a consistent limitation: current models perform poorly on textless music and sound effects, and struggle to think in context and in culture compared to surface content. These findings highlight a key gap in human-aligned multimodal intelligence and call for models that can perceive contextually and culturally beyond the surface of what they hear and see.

      <title>BanglaRobustNet: A Hybrid Denoising-Attention Architecture for Robust Bangla Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangla, one of the most widely spoken languages, remains underrepresented in state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, particularly under noisy and speaker-diverse conditions. This paper presents BanglaRobustNet, a hybrid denoising-attention framework built on Wav2Vec-BERT, designed to address these challenges. The architecture integrates a diffusion-based denoising module to suppress environmental noise while preserving Bangla-specific phonetic cues, and a contextual cross-attention module that conditions recognition on speaker embeddings for robustness across gender, age, and dialects. Trained end-to-end with a composite objective combining CTC loss, phonetic consistency, and speaker alignment, BanglaRobustNet achieves substantial reductions in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) compared to Wav2Vec-BERT and Whisper baselines. Evaluations on Mozilla Common Voice Bangla and augmented noisy speech confirm the effectiveness of our approach, establishing BanglaRobustNet as a robust ASR system tailored to low-resource, noise-prone linguistic settings.</description>

      <title>Segment Length Matters: A Study of Segment Lengths on Audio Fingerprinting Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio fingerprinting provides an identifiable representation of acoustic signals, which can be later used for identification and retrieval systems. To obtain a discriminative representation, the input audio is usually segmented into shorter time intervals, allowing local acoustic features to be extracted and analyzed. Modern neural approaches typically operate on short, fixed-duration audio segments, yet the choice of segment duration is often made heuristically and rarely examined in depth. In this paper, we study how segment length affects audio fingerprinting performance. We extend an existing neural fingerprinting architecture to adopt various segment lengths and evaluate retrieval accuracy across different segment lengths and query durations. Our results show that short segment lengths (0.5-second) generally achieve better performance. Moreover, we evaluate LLM capacity in recommending the best segment length, which shows that GPT-5-mini consistently gives the best suggestions across five considerations among three studied LLMs. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting segment duration in large-scale neural audio retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>CaSNet: Compress-and-Send Network Based Multi-Device Speech Enhancement Model for Distributed Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed microphone array (DMA) is a promising next-generation platform for speech interaction, where speech enhancement (SE) is still required to improve the speech quality in noisy cases. Existing SE methods usually first gather raw waveforms at a fusion center (FC) from all devices and then design a multi-microphone model, causing high bandwidth and energy costs. In this work, we propose a \emph{Compress-and-Send Network (CaSNet)} for resource-constrained DMAs, where one microphone serves as the FC and reference. Each of other devices encodes the measured raw data into a feature matrix, which is then compressed by singular value decomposition (SVD) to produce a more compact representation. The received features at the FC are aligned via cross window query with respect to the reference, followed by neural decoding to yield spatially coherent enhanced speech. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed CaSNet can save the data amount with a negligible impact on the performance compared to the uncompressed case. The reproducible code is available at https://github.com/Jokejiangv/CaSNet.</description>

      <title>dLLM-ASR: A Faster Diffusion LLM-based Framework for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) achieve superior performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs as decoders, but their token-by-token generation mechanism leads to inference latency that grows linearly with sequence length. Meanwhile, discrete diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling high-quality parallel sequence generation with pretrained decoders. However, directly applying native text-oriented dLLMs to ASR leads to a fundamental mismatch between open-ended text generation and the acoustically conditioned transcription paradigm required by ASR. As a result, it introduces unnecessary difficulty and computational redundancy, such as denoising from pure noise, inflexible generation lengths, and fixed denoising steps. We propose dLLM-ASR, an efficient dLLM-based ASR framework that formulates dLLM's decoding as a prior-guided and adaptive denoising process. It leverages an ASR prior to initialize the denoising process and provide an anchor for sequence length. Building upon this prior, length-adaptive pruning dynamically removes redundant tokens, while confidence-based denoising allows converged tokens to exit the denoising loop early, enabling token-level adaptive computation. Experiments demonstrate that dLLM-ASR achieves recognition accuracy comparable to autoregressive LLM-based ASR systems and delivers a 4.44$\times$ inference speedup, establishing a practical and efficient paradigm for ASR.</description>

      <title>From Human Speech to Ocean Signals: Transferring Speech Large Models for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) plays a vital role in marine applications but remains challenging due to limited labeled data and the complexity of ocean environments. This paper explores a central question: can speech large models (SLMs), trained on massive human speech corpora, be effectively transferred to underwater acoustics? To investigate this, we propose UATR-SLM, a simple framework that reuses the speech feature pipeline, adapts the SLM as an acoustic encoder, and adds a lightweight classifier.Experiments on the DeepShip and ShipsEar benchmarks show that UATR-SLM achieves over 99% in-domain accuracy, maintains strong robustness across variable signal lengths, and reaches up to 96.67% accuracy in cross-domain evaluation. These results highlight the strong transferability of SLMs to UATR, establishing a promising paradigm for leveraging speech foundation models in underwater acoustics.</description>

      <title>VIBEVOICE-ASR Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice-ASR, a general-purpose speech understanding framework built upon VibeVoice, designed to address the persistent challenges of context fragmentation and multi-speaker complexity in long-form audio (e.g., meetings, podcasts) that remain despite recent advancements in short-form speech recognition. Unlike traditional pipelined approaches that rely on audio chunking, VibeVoice-ASRsupports single-pass processing for up to 60 minutes of audio. It unifies Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Diarization, and Timestamping into a single end-to-end generation task. In addition, VibeVoice-ASR supports over 50 languages, requires no explicit language setting, and natively handles code-switching within and across utterances. Furthermore, we introduce a prompt-based context injection mechanism that allows users to supply customized conetxt, significantly improving accuracy on domain-specific terminology and polyphonic character disambiguation.</description>

      <title>LLM-ForcedAligner: A Non-Autoregressive and Accurate LLM-Based Forced Aligner for Multilingual and Long-Form Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forced alignment (FA) predicts start and end timestamps for words or characters in speech, but existing methods are language-specific and prone to cumulative temporal shifts. The multilingual speech understanding and long-sequence processing abilities of speech large language models (SLLMs) make them promising for FA in multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech settings. However, directly applying the next-token prediction paradigm of SLLMs to FA results in hallucinations and slow inference. To bridge the gap, we propose LLM-ForcedAligner, reformulating FA as a slot-filling paradigm: timestamps are treated as discrete indices, and special timestamp tokens are inserted as slots into the transcript. Conditioned on the speech embeddings and the transcript with slots, the SLLM directly predicts the time indices at slots. During training, causal attention masking with non-shifted input and label sequences allows each slot to predict its own timestamp index based on itself and preceding context, with loss computed only at slot positions. Dynamic slot insertion enables FA at arbitrary positions. Moreover, non-autoregressive inference is supported, avoiding hallucinations and improving speed. Experiments across multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech scenarios show that LLM-ForcedAligner achieves a 69%~78% relative reduction in accumulated averaging shift compared with prior methods. The checkpoint and inference code will be released later.</description>

      <title>OCR-Enhanced Multimodal ASR Can Read While Listening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual information, such as subtitles in a movie, often helps automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we propose Donut-Whisper, an audio-visual ASR model with dual encoder to leverage visual information to improve speech recognition performance in both English and Chinese. Donut-Whisper combines the advantage of the linear and the Q-Former-based modality alignment structures via a cross-attention module, generating more powerful audio-visual features. Meanwhile, we propose a lightweight knowledge distillation scheme showcasing the potential of using audio-visual models to teach audio-only models to achieve better performance. Moreover, we propose a new multilingual audio-visual speech recognition dataset based on movie clips containing both Chinese and English partitions. As a result, Donut-Whisper achieved significantly better performance on both English and Chinese partition of the dataset compared to both Donut and Whisper large V3 baselines. In particular, an absolute 5.75% WER reduction and a 16.5% absolute CER reduction were achieved on the English and Chinese sets respectively compared to the Whisper ASR baseline.</description>

      <title>Pisets: A Robust Speech Recognition System for Lectures and Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a speech-to-text system "Pisets" for scientists and journalists which is based on a three-component architecture aimed at improving speech recognition accuracy while minimizing errors and hallucinations associated with the Whisper model. The architecture comprises primary recognition using Wav2Vec2, false positive filtering via the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and final speech recognition through Whisper. The implementation of curriculum learning methods and the utilization of diverse Russian-language speech corpora significantly enhanced the system's effectiveness. Additionally, advanced uncertainty modeling techniques were introduced, contributing to further improvements in transcription quality. The proposed approaches ensure robust transcribing of long audio data across various acoustic conditions compared to WhisperX and the usual Whisper model. The source code of "Pisets" system is publicly available at GitHub: https://github.com/bond005/pisets.</description>

      <title>Geneses: Unified Generative Speech Enhancement and Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world audio recordings often contain multiple speakers and various degradations, which limit both the quantity and quality of speech data available for building state-of-the-art speech processing models. Although end-to-end approaches that concatenate speech enhancement (SE) and speech separation (SS) to obtain a clean speech signal for each speaker are promising, conventional SE-SS methods suffer from complex degradations beyond additive noise. To this end, we propose \textbf{Geneses}, a generative framework to achieve unified, high-quality SE--SS. Our Geneses leverages latent flow matching to estimate each speaker's clean speech features using multi-modal diffusion Transformer conditioned on self-supervised learning representation from noisy mixture. We conduct experimental evaluation using two-speaker mixtures from LibriTTS-R under two conditions: additive-noise-only and complex degradations. The results demonstrate that Geneses significantly outperforms a conventional mask-based SE--SS method across various objective metrics with high robustness against complex degradations. Audio samples are available in our demo page.</description>

      <title>MELA-TTS: Joint transformer-diffusion model with representation alignment for speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces MELA-TTS, a novel joint transformer-diffusion framework for end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis. By autoregressively generating continuous mel-spectrogram frames from linguistic and speaker conditions, our architecture eliminates the need for speech tokenization and multi-stage processing pipelines. To address the inherent difficulties of modeling continuous features, we propose a representation alignment module that aligns output representations of the transformer decoder with semantic embeddings from a pretrained ASR encoder during training. This mechanism not only speeds up training convergence, but also enhances cross-modal coherence between the textual and acoustic domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MELA-TTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining robust zero-shot voice cloning capabilities, in both offline and streaming synthesis modes. Our results establish a new benchmark for continuous feature generation approaches in TTS, offering a compelling alternative to discrete-token-based paradigms.</description>

      <title>VoXtream: Full-Stream Text-to-Speech with Extremely Low Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present VoXtream, a fully autoregressive, zero-shot streaming text-to-speech (TTS) system for real-time use that begins speaking from the first word. VoXtream directly maps incoming phonemes to audio tokens using a monotonic alignment scheme and a limited look-ahead that does not delay onset. Built around an incremental phoneme transformer, a temporal transformer predicting semantic and duration tokens, and a depth transformer producing acoustic tokens, VoXtream achieves, to our knowledge, the lowest initial delay among publicly available streaming TTS: 102 ms on GPU. Despite being trained on a mid-scale 9k-hour corpus, it matches or surpasses larger baselines on several metrics, while delivering competitive quality in both output- and full-streaming settings. Demo and code are available at https://herimor.github.io/voxtream.</description>

      <title>ARTI-6: Towards Six-dimensional Articulatory Speech Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three components: (1) a six-dimensional articulatory feature set representing key regions of the vocal tract; (2) an articulatory inversion model, which predicts articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory synthesis model, which reconstructs intelligible speech directly from articulatory features, showing that even a low-dimensional representation can generate natural-sounding speech. Together, ARTI-6 provides an interpretable, computationally efficient, and physiologically grounded framework for advancing articulatory inversion, synthesis, and broader speech technology applications. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.</description>

      <title>TASU: Text-Only Alignment for Speech Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have paved the way for unified architectures across diverse speech understanding tasks. However, prevailing alignment paradigms rely heavily on large-scale audio-text paired data and computationally intensive training, yet often exhibit limited generalization to unseen domains or tasks. To address these limitations, we propose TASU (Text-only Alignment for Speech Understanding), a novel alignment paradigm that can leverage only unpaired text data to guide cross-modal alignment. Experiments show that TASU achieves competitive zero-shot speech recognition. Leveraging this property, it can further function as a pre-training stage in curriculum learning, enhancing domain generalization in speech recognition. Ultimately, TASU can extend its zero-shot generalization to a wide range of speech understanding tasks and notably outperforms prominent Speech LLMs including GLM-4-Voice and Step-Audio on the MMSU benchmark, establishing TASU as an efficient and scalable alignment paradigm for Speech LLMs.</description>

      <title>How Far Do SSL Speech Models Listen for Tone? Temporal Focus of Tone Representation under Low-resource Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lexical tone is central to many languages but remains underexplored in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, especially beyond Mandarin. We study four languages with complex and diverse tone systems (Burmese, Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese) to ask how far such models "listen" for tone and how transfer operates in low-resource conditions. As a baseline reference, we estimate the temporal span of tone cues: approximately 100ms (Burmese/Thai) and 180ms (Lao/Vietnamese). Probes and gradient analysis on fine-tuned SSL models reveal that tone transfer varies by downstream task: automatic speech recognition fine-tuning aligns spans with language-specific tone cues, while prosody- and voice-related tasks bias toward overly long spans. These findings indicate that tone transfer is shaped by downstream task, highlighting task effects on temporal focus in tone modeling.</description>

      <title>XLSR-MamBo: Scaling the Hybrid Mamba-Attention Backbone for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced speech synthesis technologies have enabled highly realistic speech generation, posing security risks that motivate research into audio deepfake detection (ADD). While state space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, pure causal SSMs architectures often struggle with the content-based retrieval required to capture global frequency-domain artifacts. To address this, we explore the scaling properties of hybrid architectures by proposing XLSR-MamBo, a modular framework integrating an XLSR front-end with synergistic Mamba-Attention backbones. We systematically evaluate four topological designs using advanced SSM variants, Mamba, Mamba2, Hydra, and Gated DeltaNet. Experimental results demonstrate that the MamBo-3-Hydra-N3 configuration achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art systems on the ASVspoof 2021 LA, DF, and In-the-Wild benchmarks. This performance benefits from Hydra's native bidirectional modeling, which captures holistic temporal dependencies more efficiently than the heuristic dual-branch strategies employed in prior works. Furthermore, evaluations on the DFADD dataset demonstrate robust generalization to unseen diffusion- and flow-matching-based synthesis methods. Crucially, our analysis reveals that scaling backbone depth effectively mitigates the performance variance and instability observed in shallower models. These results demonstrate the hybrid framework's ability to capture artifacts in spoofed speech signals, providing an effective method for ADD.</description>

      <title>Sound event localization and classification using WASN in Outdoor Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based sound event localization and classification is an emerging research area within wireless acoustic sensor networks. However, current methods for sound event localization and classification typically rely on a single microphone array, making them susceptible to signal attenuation and environmental noise, which limits their monitoring range. Moreover, methods using multiple microphone arrays often focus solely on source localization, neglecting the aspect of sound event classification. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method that employs multiple features and attention mechanisms to estimate the location and class of sound source. We introduce a Soundmap feature to capture spatial information across multiple frequency bands. We also use the Gammatone filter to generate acoustic features more suitable for outdoor environments. Furthermore, we integrate attention mechanisms to learn channel-wise relationships and temporal dependencies within the acoustic features. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments using simulated datasets with different levels of noise and size of monitoring areas, as well as different arrays and source positions. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in both sound event classification and sound source localization tasks. And we provide further analysis to explain the reasons for the observed errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing work in automatic music generation has mostly focused on end-to-end systems that generate either entire compositions or continuations of pieces, which are difficult for composers to iterate on. The area of computer-assisted composition, where generative models integrate into existing creative workflows, remains comparatively underexplored. In this study, we address the tasks of model style adaptation and multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a small foundation model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for style adaptation in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics with respect to existing models, and release model weights and code at https://github.com/christianazinn/MIDI-RWKV.</description>

      <title>From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</description>

      <title>How Does a Deep Neural Network Look at Lexical Stress in English Words?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.</description>

      <title>DISPATCH: Distilling Selective Patches for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In speech enhancement, knowledge distillation (KD) compresses models by transferring a high-capacity teacher's knowledge to a compact student. However, conventional KD methods train the student to mimic the teacher's output entirely, which forces the student to imitate the regions where the teacher performs poorly and to apply distillation to the regions where the student already performs well, which yields only marginal gains. We propose Distilling Selective Patches (DISPatch), a KD framework for speech enhancement that applies the distillation loss to spectrogram patches where the teacher outperforms the student, as determined by a Knowledge Gap Score. This approach guides optimization toward areas with the most significant potential for student improvement while minimizing the influence of regions where the teacher may provide unreliable instruction. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Scale Selective Patches (MSSP), a frequency-dependent method that uses different patch sizes across low- and high-frequency bands to account for spectral heterogeneity. We incorporate DISPatch into conventional KD methods and observe consistent gains in compact students. Moreover, integrating DISPatch and MSSP into a state-of-the-art frequency-dependent KD method considerably improves performance across all metrics.</description>

      <title>Sidon: Fast and Robust Open-Source Multilingual Speech Restoration for Large-scale Dataset Cleansing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.</description>

      <title>SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro extends the annotations of the additional data to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent state-of-the-art approaches. Each clip is rated by at least five experienced annotators to ensure reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we investigate strategies for effectively utilizing MOS data annotated under heterogeneous standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TangRain/SingMOS-Pro.</description>

      <title>Probing the Hidden Talent of ASR Foundation Models for L2 English Oral Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>RRPO: Robust Reward Policy Optimization for LLM-based Emotional TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

      <title>Mathematical Foundations of Polyphonic Music Generation via Structural Inductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph introduces a novel approach to polyphonic music generation by addressing the "Missing Middle" problem through structural inductive bias. Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.</description>

      <title>Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.</description>
