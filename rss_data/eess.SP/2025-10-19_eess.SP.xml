      <title>A Structured Family of Grassmannian Constellations via Geodesic Mapping for MIMO Noncoherent Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel structured family of Grassmannian constellations for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) noncoherent communications over Rayleigh block-fading channels, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver has channel state information (CSI). The proposed constellation design is built upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its underlying geometric structure. The resulting solution is limited in spectral efficiency (with a maximum constellation size of $4M^2$ points, where $M$ is the number of transmit antennas), targeting a rate in the range of $0.25$-$1$ bps/Hz. However, all space-time matrices resulting from this design exhibit the remarkable property of having a single nonzero entry per row, meaning that only one transmit antenna is active per time slot. This property significantly reduces hardware complexity and implementation cost, while also lowering power consumption, as only a single power amplifier is required for transmission. Furthermore, within the constellation size limits, the proposed design achieves error performance comparable to state-of-the-art optimization-based unstructured designs, as validated through symbol error rate (SER) numerical results. It also enables simple yet effective bit labeling, confirmed by comparisons of bit error rate (BER) and SER, and reduces the computational complexity of the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for Grassmannian constellations by a factor of $M$.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Integrated Sensing &amp; Communication with Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS is an emerging framework for integrated sensing &amp; communication (ISAC) in high delay and Doppler spread environments. A critical enabler for ISAC with Zak-OTFS is the design of pulse shaping filters. For sensing, a localized pulse shaping filter enables ideal input-output (I/O) relation estimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication, orthogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents inter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full spectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is ideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two of the above objectives, but not all three simultaneously. For instance, the sinc filter is orthogonal and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not localized. The Gaussian filter is localized and bandwidth/time-limited, but not orthogonal. The RRC filter is localized and orthogonal, but not bandwidth/time-limited. A recently proposed hybrid Gaussian-sinc filter is more localized than the sinc filter and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not orthogonal. In this work, we design optimal pulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm. The proposed pulse shaping filters offer improved data detection (communication) and I/O relation estimation (sensing) performance compared to existing filter choices in the literature.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Physiology-Inspired Enhanced Vital Sign Monitoring Using MIMO mmWave Bio-radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the intensiffcation of population aging and increasing burden of chronic diseases, the demand for vital signs monitoring is becoming increasingly urgent. A key challenge facing current non-contact detection technologies using millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is the low efffciency of multi-channel signal fusion in array radar systems based on equal weighting. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a vital sign enhancement detection method for multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) bio-radar, driven by multidimensional physiological characteristics, which overcomes traditional limitations through a two-stage fusion strategy. Stage 1: Enhanced Vital Sign Detection Using Single-Channel Signals Based on Physiological Characteristics. First, a chest wall multi-scattering point model is constructed. For single channel time-distance two-dimensional echo signals, effective range bins are selected based on the respiratory/cardiac physiological frequency band energy ratio, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of respiration/heart signals is enhanced using phase-aligned maximal ratio combining (MRC). Stage 2: Multi-Channel Fusion Based on Organ Radiation Spatial Distribution Characteristics. The spatial radiation characteristics of cardiopulmonary organs are introduced for the ffrst time as the theoretical foundation for SNR-based channel screening, channel attribute identiffcation, and multi-channel weighted fusion. Then, we propose a template matching method to extract respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) by adopting physical models of respiration and cardiac activities. The experimental results demonstrate the existence of the spatial distribution characteristics of organ radiation. In addition, we analyzed the impact of distance and state on the algorithm from these two aspects.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Flexible Angular Emulation for ISAC Base Station Testing Using a Conductive Amplitude and Phase Matrix Setup: Framework and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the functionalities, algorithms, hardware components, and performance characteristics of future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) base stations (BSs) under realistic deployment scenarios in controlled laboratory environments represents a critical requirement for ISAC technology advancement. A primary challenge in achieving this objective involves the emulation of multiple targets with arbitrary radar cross-section (RCS), range, angle, and Doppler profiles for ISAC BS equipped with large-scale antenna arrays using radar target simulator (RTS) with limited interface ports. In this work, we introduce a simple yet highly effective and practical conductive amplitude and phase matrix framework to address this fundamental challenge. The core concept involves introducing a tunable conductive amplitude and phase modulation network in the test configuration between the ISAC BS under test and a RTS. Based on this structure, we subsequently investigate the corresponding configurations for different sensing operational modes of ISAC BSs, specifically the array duplex transmission and reception (ADTR) mode and the split-array transmission and reception (SATR) mode. For experimental validation, we design two distinct monostatic sensing scenarios to demonstrate the framework capabilities across both operational modes. The first scenario involves dynamic multi-drone sensing validation for ADTR mode operation, while the second scenario addresses static single-drone sensing for SATR mode validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately emulate the joint RCS, range, velocity, and angular characteristics of multiple sensing targets within the conductive test environment, highlighting its significant potential for testing applications in sub-6 GHz ISAC BS development and validation.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Random TDM-MIMO FMCW Based Millimeter-Wave Sensing and Communication Integration for UAV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) can achieve the sharing of hardware and spectrum resources, enabling efficient data transmission and environmental sensing. This fusion is particularly important for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, as it enhances the overall performance, flexibility, and efficiency of such systems. To facilitate the collaborative operations among UAVs, this paper proposes an ISAC solution based on the pseudo-random time-division multiplexing (TDM)-multiple input multiple output (MIMO) millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW). Specifically, a novel ISAC chirp waveform is proposed to modulate data in both the delay domain and complex amplitude, while also possessing high-precision sensing capabilities. To address challenges in the TDM-MIMO, we utilize the pseudo-random antenna selection and compressed sensing algorithms, ensuring that the maximum unambiguous velocity is not compromised. Moreover, by employing a chirp-division multiple access scheme, we propose an interference-free multiple antenna transmission scheme to achieve dynamic allocation of time-frequency resources and multi-user transmission. Finally, we propose a communication and sensing fusion-based dynamic iterative computation scheme, simultaneously achieving data demodulation and sensing parameter estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve ISAC under the dynamic flight scenarios of UAVs. Meanwhile, the scheme outperforms the mmWave-LoRadar in communication and sensing performance, yet its sensing performance is slightly lower than that of the traditional FMCW. Under the urban clutter modeling, the scheme still maintains favorable robustness despite a certain degree of performance degradation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many authors have examined various boundary behaviors of injective harmonic mappings in the open unit disk. Building on Laugesen's work, Bshouty and others explored the boundary behavior of harmonic mappings under different conditions. In this paper, we extend their work and find out the angular limits of the arguments and logarithms of analytic functions under various conditions. We also examined the dilatation possesses only a finite set of zeros within any stolz angle if the first derivative of harmonic function $f$ at the boundary is positive infinity.</description>

      <title>Detection Seizure Onset Zone Using Circadian Fluctuating Epileptic Biomarkers: A Signal Processing and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epileptic biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying the origin of seizures, an essential aspect of pre-surgical planning for epilepsy treatment. These biomarkers can vary significantly over time. By studying these temporal fluctuations, we can enhance their effectiveness in guiding surgical planning. This research focuses on examining how circadian rhythms influence epilepsy biomarkers and aims to determine the optimal times for their analysis. To investigate the relationship between epilepsy biomarkers and circadian rhythm, the sleep/wake states first need to be classified. After the biomarkers are identified, they are compared across these states. A retrospective analysis was conducted on intracranial electroencephalography data from patients with focal epilepsy. The biomarkers spike, sequence of spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and pathological HFOs were identified through automatic detection. The alpha/delta ratio was also calculated to distinguish between asleep and awake stages. Data from 9 patients were analyzed, and the classification of sleep and wake states was achieved with an area under the curve of 84%. All biomarker rates were higher during the sleep stage compared to the wake stage. Pathological HFOs and the sequence of spikes proved to be more precise indicators regarding distance to seizure onset than spikes or HFOs. Unlike previous studies that relied predominantly on long-term spike biomarker analysis, this study is the first to utilize a comprehensive set of biomarkers, including HFOs, spike sequences, and pathological HFOs, to enhance seizure onset zone prediction. The rates of epilepsy biomarkers during sleep vary considerably from those seen while awake, making sleep data analysis more effective for accurately predicting the seizure onset zone.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Electromagnetic Interference and Inter-RIS Reflections in Indoor Factory Local 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sixth Generation (6G) radio technology is expected to include local 6G networks as a special use case, extending the capabilities of `generic' 6G networks towards more demanding performance requirements. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a novel paradigm for next-generation wireless communications, especially in the context of local 6G networks, enabling advanced signal propagation control through intelligent phase-shift configurations. However, in practical deployments, their performance can be adversely affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources and inter-RIS reflections (IRR) caused by signal reflections between multiple colocated RIS units. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the joint impact of EMI and IRR in a multi-RIS multi-cell system deployed within an indoor factory environment. A detailed evaluation study is first carried out to investigate their impact on system performance. System-level simulations demonstrate that the joint impact of EMI and IRR degrades system performance more significantly than their individual effects, particularly as RIS dimensions and transmit power increase. To address these adverse effects, an alternate optimization algorithm using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method is then proposed. The novel algorithm optimizes the phase shifts of the RIS elements considering the spatial correlation among their associated channels, and is found to provide up to several orders of magnitude gains in terms of the system sum rate and the outage probability.</description>

      <title>RIS-assisted Atomic MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and low-complexity atomic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver architecture assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). By introducing RIS and utilizing pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), the phase of the transmitted signal is effectively aligned with that of the local oscillator (LO), thereby mitigating phase ambiguity and substantially reducing both signal detection complexity and overall receiver complexity.To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we reformulate it into a tractable form by minimizing the Frobenius norm of an equivalent matrix, which is efficiently solved using an Adam-based gradient descent algorithm.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Satellites for Enhanced Ground-to-Space Direct Uplink Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance advantages of Rydberg atomic quantum (RAQ)-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellites for enhancing direct ground-to-space uplink access.We analytically evaluate the impact of Rydberg atoms on channel estimation by deriving closed-form expressions for the mean-square error (MSE) and normalized mean-square error (NMSE). Based on the estimated channels, we further derive lower bounds on the achievable data rates for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) detection schemes. Rigorous analysis demonstrates that RAQ-MIMO outperforms conventional radio-frequency (RF) MIMO under both Rayleigh and satellite channel conditions. Specifically, compared with conventional MIMO, RAQR achieves a ``squaring" gain under Rayleigh fading, especially in long-distance transmission scenarios with stringent power constraints. In contrast, under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated satellite channels, this gain saturates as channel-estimation benefits diminish, with the remaining improvement primarily arising from the normalized noise background. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and show that the performance gains of RAQ-MIMO satellites translate into smaller antenna apertures, lower transmit power, and longer communication ranges, thereby paving the way for next-generation satellite networks.</description>

      <title>From Active to Battery-Free: Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Self-Sustained SWIPT-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a hybrid simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture, where the base station (BS) uses a conventional RF transmitter for downlink transmission and a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) for receiving uplink signal from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To fully exploit this integration, we jointly design the transmission scheme and the power-splitting strategy to maximize the sum rate, which leads to a non-convex problem. To address this challenge, we first derive closed-form lower bounds on the uplink achievable rates for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF), as well as on the downlink rate and harvested energy for maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and ZF precoding. Building upon these bounds, we propose an iterative algorithm relying on the best monomial approximation and geometric programming (GP) to solve the non-convex problem. Finally, simulations validate the tightness of our derived lower bounds and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Importantly, by integrating RAQR with SWIPT-enabled MIMO, the BS can reliably detect weak uplink signals from IoT devices powered only by harvested energy, enabling battery-free communication.</description>

      <title>Resilient Full-Duplex ISAC in the Face of Imperfect SI Cancellation: Globally Optimal Timeslot Allocation and Beam Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.</description>

      <title>Targeted Attacks and Defenses for Distributed Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In emerging networked systems, mobile edge devices such as ground vehicles and unmanned aerial system (UAS) swarms collectively aggregate vast amounts of data to make machine learning decisions such as threat detection in remote, dynamic, and infrastructure-constrained environments where power and bandwidth are scarce. Federated learning (FL) addresses these constraints and privacy concerns by enabling nodes to share local model weights for deep neural networks instead of raw data, facilitating more reliable decision-making than individual learning. However, conventional FL relies on a central server to coordinate model updates in each learning round, which imposes significant computational burdens on the central node and may not be feasible due to the connectivity constraints. By eliminating dependence on a central server, distributed federated learning (DFL) offers scalability, resilience to node failures, learning robustness, and more effective defense strategies. Despite these advantages, DFL remains vulnerable to increasingly advanced and stealthy cyberattacks. In this paper, we design sophisticated targeted training data poisoning and backdoor (Trojan) attacks, and characterize the emerging vulnerabilities in a vehicular network. We analyze how DFL provides resilience against such attacks compared to individual learning and present effective defense mechanisms to further strengthen DFL against the emerging cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-exploiting Gaussian Process for Robust Transient Learning of Power System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in leveraging Gaussian processes (GP) have enabled learning and inferring dynamic grid behavior from scarce PMU measurements. However, real measurements can be corrupted by various random and targeted threats, leading to inaccurate and meaningless results. This paper develops robust transient learning to overcome this challenge by exploiting the sparse corruption patterns in the data flow. Specifically, we integrate sparse optimization with method of moments (MoM) to make learning robust to a sparse distribution of data corruptions; then, we optimize sparse weights to identify corrupted meter locations. To improve inference speed on large-scale systems, we further adopt K-medoid clustering of locations to develop dimension reduction (DR) and aggregate representation (AR) heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate robustness against random large errors, targeted false data injections, and local PMU clock drifts. On a 1354-bus system, inference turns out to be 18x faster using DR and 400x faster when further combined with AR heuristics.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Compressive Security</title>

Abstract: Beyond its widespread application in signal and image processing, \emph{compressed sensing} principles have been greatly applied to secure information transmission (often termed 'compressive security'). In this scenario, the measurement matrix $Q$ acts as a one time pad encryption key (in complex number domain) which can achieve perfect information-theoretic security together with other benefits such as reduced complexity and energy efficiency particularly useful in IoT. However, unless the matrix is changed for every message it is vulnerable towards known plain text attacks: only $n$ observations suffices to recover a key $Q$ with $n$ columns. In this paper, we invent and analyze a new method (termed 'Bilinear Compressive Security (BCS)') addressing these shortcomings: In addition to the linear encoding of the message $x$ with a matrix $Q$, the sender convolves the resulting vector with a randomly generated filter $h$. Assuming that $h$ and $x$ are sparse, the receiver can then recover $x$ without knowledge of $h$ from $y=h*Qx$ through blind deconvolution. We study a rather idealized known plaintext attack for recovering $Q$ from repeated observations of $y$'s for different, known $x_k$, with varying and unknown $h$ ,giving Eve a number of advantages not present in practice. Our main result for BCS states that under a weak symmetry condition on the filter $h$, recovering $Q$ will require extensive sampling from transmissions of $\Omega\left(\max\left(n,(n/s)^2\right)\right)$ messages $x_k$ if they are $s$-sparse. Remarkably, with $s=1$ it is impossible to recover the key. In this way, the scheme is much safer than standard compressed sensing even though our assumptions are much in favor towards a potential attacker.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Contrastive Sensor Fusion for Multimodal Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first parameter-free decentralized online learning algorithms with network regret guarantees, which achieve sublinear regret without requiring hyperparameter tuning. This family of algorithms connects multi-agent coin-betting and decentralized online learning via gossip steps. To enable our decentralized analysis, we introduce a novel "betting function" formulation for coin-betting that simplifies the multi-agent regret analysis. Our analysis shows sublinear network regret bounds and is validated through experiments on synthetic and real datasets. This family of algorithms is applicable to distributed sensing, decentralized optimization, and collaborative ML applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal RIS Under Non-Idealities: Learning-Based Architecture Discovery and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has recently been introduced to enable advanced control over electromagnetic waves to further increase the benefits of traditional RIS in enhancing signal quality and improving spectral and energy efficiency for next-generation wireless networks. A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore, how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities, which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff.</description>

      <title>A New Time Series Similarity Measure and Its Smart Grid Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many smart grid applications involve data mining, clustering, classification, identification, and anomaly detection, among others. These applications primarily depend on the measurement of similarity, which is the distance between different time series or subsequences of a time series. The commonly used time series distance measures, namely Euclidean Distance (ED) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), do not quantify the flexible nature of electricity usage data in terms of temporal dynamics. As a result, there is a need for a new distance measure that can quantify both the amplitude and temporal changes of electricity time series for smart grid applications, e.g., demand response and load profiling. This paper introduces a novel distance measure to compare electricity usage patterns. The method consists of two phases that quantify the effort required to reshape one time series into another, considering both amplitude and temporal changes. The proposed method is evaluated against ED and DTW using real-world data in three smart grid applications. Overall, the proposed measure outperforms ED and DTW in accurately identifying the best load scheduling strategy, anomalous days with irregular electricity usage, and determining electricity users' behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for determining the current signature faults using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) has been developed. The method has been applied to the real-time steady-state current of the inverter-fed high power induction motor for fault determination. The method incorporates calculating the relative norm error to find the threshold value between healthy and unhealthy induction motor at different operating frequencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the total harmonics distortion of unhealthy motor is much larger than the healthy motor, and the threshold relative norm error value of different healthy induction motors is less than 0.3, and the threshold relative norm error value of unhealthy induction motor is greater than 0.5. The developed method can function as a simple operator-assisted tool for determining induction motor faults in real-time.</description>

      <title>Reducing Latency by Eliminating CSIT Feedback: FDD Downlink MIMO Precoding Without CSIT Feedback for Internet-of-Things Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for low-latency frequency division duplex (FDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission with Internet of Things (IoT) communications. Our key idea is eliminating feedback associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. Instead, we propose to reconstruct downlink CSIT from uplink reference signals by exploiting the frequency invariance property of channel parameters. Nonetheless, the frequency disparity between the uplink and downlink makes it impossible to get perfect downlink CSIT, resulting in substantial interference. To address this, we formulate a max-min fairness problem and propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided efficient precoding method. In particular, to fully harness the potential benefits of RSMA, we propose a method that approximates the error covariance matrix and incorporates it into the precoder optimization process. This approach effectively accounts for the impact of imperfect CSIT, enabling the design of a robust precoder that efficiently handles CSIT inaccuracies. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the minimum spectral efficiency when no direct CSI feedback is used. Moreover, we show that our framework significantly reduces communication latency compared to conventional CSI feedback-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing latency performance for IoT communications.</description>

      <title>Finetuning and Quantization of EEG-Based Foundational BioSignal Models on ECG and PPG Data for Blood Pressure Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) is a key indicator of cardiovascular health. As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.</description>

      <title>EAGLE: Contextual Point Cloud Generation via Adaptive Continuous Normalizing Flow with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As 3D point clouds become the prevailing shape representation in computer vision, how to generate high-resolution point clouds has become a pressing issue. Flow-based generative models can effectively perform point cloud generation tasks. However, traditional CNN-based flow architectures rely only on local information to extract features, making it difficult to capture global contextual information. Inspired by the wide adoption of Transformers, we explored the complementary roles of self-attention mechanisms in Transformers, CNN, and continuous normalizing flows. To this end, we propose a probabilistic model via adaptive normalizing flows and self-attention. Our idea leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture global contextual information. We also propose adaptive continuous normalizing flows by introducing adaptive bias correction mechanism. Combined with normalization, the mechanism dynamically handles different input contexts and mitigates potential bias-shift issues from standard initialization. Experimental results demonstrate that EAGLE achieves competitive performance in point cloud generation.</description>

      <title>RadarLLM: Adapting Pretrained Large Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection with Preference-aware Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting is mainly due to the model's tendency to memorize noisy feature patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens, this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function outperforms the original one, showing particularly significant improvements under challenging low SCR conditions, with an average performance gain of 9.9% and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under limited training data conditions.</description>

      <title>Wearable and Ultra-Low-Power Fusion of EMG and A-Mode US for Hand-Wrist Kinematic Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW) system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable, dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23 degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to $12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$ score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.</description>

Abstract: Optical link tomography (OLT) is a rapidly evolving field that allows the multi-span, end-to-end visualization of optical power along fiber links in multiple dimensions from network endpoints, solely by processing signals received at coherent receivers. This paper has two objectives: (1) to report the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D (distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network scenarios are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Lightweight Approach to Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors in High-Dimensional Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate AI-based diagnostic system for induction motors (IMs) holds the potential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and curbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably, among the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently encountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using signal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid architectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the training of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking overfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This paper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults by using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for diagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration signal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with 47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2 model exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as accurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the visualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also provides insights into the training and testing times for each model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation for the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion via Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent (APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our proof provides extra upper bounds that act as analogies of the random graph lemma under EDMC setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates rapidly when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.</description>

      <title>Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</description>
