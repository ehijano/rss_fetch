      <title>Exact Regular Black Hole Solutions with de Sitter Cores and Hagedorn Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three exact solutions to the Einstein field equations, each showing different black hole models. The first solution introduces a black hole with a variable equation of state, \( P=k(r)\rho \), that can represent both singular and regular black holes based on parameters \( M_0 \) and \( w_0 \). The second solution features a black hole with Hagedorn fluid, relevant for the late stages of black hole formation, and reveals similarities to the first solution, describing both singular and regular black holes in a specific case. Furthermore, we investigate the shadow cast by these black hole solutions to constrain their parameters. Recognizing that real astrophysical black holes are dynamic, we developed a third, dynamical solution that addresses gravitational collapse and suggests the potential formation of naked singularities, indicating that a black hole can transition from regular to singular and back to regular during its evolution.</description>

      <title>Study of Stable Dark Energy Stars in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure and basic physical properties of non-rotating dark energy stars in Ho$\Check{\text{r}}$ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The interior of propsed stellar structure is made of isotropic matter obeys extended Chaplygin gas EoS. The structure equations representing the state of hydrostatic equilibrium i.e., generalize TOV equation in HL gravity is numerically solved by using chosen realistic EoS. Next, we investigate the deviation of physical features of dark energy stars in HL gravity as compared with general relativity (GR). Such investigation is depicted by varying a parameter $\omega$, whereas for $\omega\rightarrow \infty$ HL coincide with GR. As a results, we find that necessary features of our stellar structure are significantly affected by $\omega$ in HL gravity specifically on the estimation of the maximum mass and corresponding predicted radius of the star. In conclusion, we can predict the existence of heavior massive dark energy stars in the context of HL gravity as compared with GR with not collapsing into a black hole. Moreover, we investigate the stability of our proposed stellar system. By integrating the modified perturbations equations in support of suitable boundary conditions at the center and the surface of the stellar object, we evaluate the frequencies and eigenfunctions corresponding to six lowest excited modes. Finally, we find that physically viable and stable dark energy stars can be successfully discussed in HL gravity by this study.</description>

      <title>Properties of wormhole model in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley like massive gravity with specific matter density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the conventional method of studying wormhole (WH) geometry, traversability requires the presence of exotic matter, which also provides negative gravity effects to keep the wormhole throat open. In dRGT massive gravity theory, we produce two types of WH solutions in our present paper. Selecting a static and spherically symmetric metric for the background geometry, we obtain the field equations for exact WH solutions. We derive the WH geometry completely for the two different choices of redshift functions. All the energy conditions including the NEC are violated by the obtained WH solutions. Various plots are used to illustrate the behavior of the wormhole for a suitable range of $m^2c_1$, where $m$ is the graviton mass. It is observed that the photon deflection angle becomes negative for all values of $m^2c_1$ as a result of the repulsive action of gravity. It is also studied that the repulsive impact of massive gravitons pushes the spacetime geometry so strongly that the asymptotic flatness is affected. The Volume Integral Quantifier (VIQ) has also been computed to determine the amounts of matter that violate the null energy condition. The complexity factor of the proposed model is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced birefringence in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric optics effectively describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves when the wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the medium, making wave phenomena like diffraction negligible. As a result, light propagation in a vacuum is typically modeled by rays that follow null geodesics. However, general relativity predicts that polarization-dependent deviations from these geodesics occur in an inhomogeneous gravitational field. In this article, we evaluate the corrections for the deflection and emission of light by a massive gravitating body. Additionally, we derive the scaling behavior of the physical parameters characterizing the trajectories. The calculations are performed in the leading order in frequency. We use these results to assess the significance of the birefringence effect in various astrophysical observations. We find that the effect cannot be measured with current instruments but may be detectable in the near future.</description>

      <title>Simple Bianchi cosmologies with anisotropic Segre [1(11,1)] dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a sample anisotropic but spatially homogeneous metric to look at the properties of Segre type [1(11,1)] universes, that behave like vacuum energy along a spatial plane (two stresses equal to the negative density) but have distinct stress along the third spatial axis. We examine situations with simple relationships between the distinct and degenerate stresses, finding a closed form parameterizations for the case where the distinct stress is equal to zero and finding new conditions in which the case with all stresses equal has a closed form parameterization. We also use numerical methods to illustrate possible behaviors for the case where the distinct stress is the negative of the degenerate stresses.</description>

      <title>Adding higher-order spherical harmonics in non-spinning eccentric binary black hole merger waveform models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: gwNRHME is a recently developed framework that seamlessly converts a multi-modal (i.e with several spherical harmonic modes) quasi-circular waveform into multi-modal eccentric waveform if the quadrupolar eccentric waveform is known. Here, we employ the gwNRHME framework to combine a multi-modal quasi-circular waveform model NRHybSur3dq8 and quadrupolar non-spinning eccentric waveform model EccentricIMR to construct multi-modal non-spinning eccentric model NRHybSur3dq8-gwNRHME. Using a total of 35 eccentric numerical relativity (NR) simulations obtained from the SXS and RIT catalogs, we demonstrate that NRHybSur3dq8-gwNRHME model predictions agree well with NR (with typical relative $L_2$ errors of ~0.01 for the dominant quadrupolar mode) for mass ratios $ 1 \leq q \leq 4$ and eccentricities up to ~0.2 measured about 10 cycles before the merger. To demonstrate the modularity of the gwNRHME framework, we further combine EccentricIMR with BHPTNRSur1dq1e4 model and develop a non-spinning eccentric models named BHPTNRSur1dq1e4-gwNRHME. Finally, we develop a different variant of these models by replacing EccentricIMR with EccentricTD. Both the gwNRHME framework and associated models are available through the gwModels package.</description>

      <title>Constraining viscous-fluid models in $f(Q)$ gravity using cosmic measurements and large-scale structure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the effects of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various toy models of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law ($f_{1\rm{CDM}}$), exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$), and logarithmic ($f_{3\rm{CDM}}$) are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these models, we use 57 Hubble parameter data points (OHD), 1048 supernovae distance modulus (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate ($f$-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m, H_0$ and exponents $\{n, p, \gamma\}$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta_0$, through a detailed statistical analysis. Moreover, we study linear cosmological perturbations and compute the density contrast \(\delta(z)\), growth factor $D(z)$, growth rate $(f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with \lcdm is made. From our statistical analysis of cosmic measurements, we found an underestimation of all models on the OHD data; therefore, statistical viability led us to weigh it in favour of SNIa data which resulted in the exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$) model without bulk viscosity being the most plausible alternative model, while on average the $f_{1\rm{CDM}}$ model performed statistically the weakest. We also found that adding bulk viscosity did not improve the fit of the models to all observational data.</description>

      <title>A generative adversarial network for stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rapid stellar core-collapse waveform emulator built using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The DCGAN was trained on the Richers \textit{et al.~}\cite{richers:2017} waveform catalogue to learn the structure of rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-wave signals and generate realistic waveforms. We show that the DCGAN learns the distribution of the training data reasonably well, and that the waveform emulator produces signals that appear to have the key features of core-collapse, bounce, early post-bounce, and ringdown oscillations of the early proto-neutron star. The pre-trained DCGAN can therefore be used as a phenomenological model for rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves.</description>

      <title>Near horizon limit of the Wang--Yau quasi-local mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we compute the limit of the Wang--Yau quasi-local mass on a family of surfaces approaching the apparent horizon (the near horizon limit). Such limit is first considered in [1]. Recently, Pook-Kolb, Zhao, Andersson, Krishnan, and Yau investigated the near horizon limit of the Wang--Yau quasi-local mass in binary black hole mergers in [12] and conjectured that the optimal embeddings approach the isometric embedding of the horizon into $\R^3$. Moreover, the quasi-local mass converges to the total mean curvature of the image. The vanishing of the norm of the mean curvature vector implies special properties for the Wang--Yau quasi-local energy and the optimal embedding equation. We utilize these features to prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal embedding and investigate the minimization of the Wang--Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we prove the continuity of the quasi-local mass in the near horizon limit.</description>

      <title>Can a naked singularity be formed during the gravitational collapse of a Janis-Newman-Winicour solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime possesses a naked singularity, although it represents an exact particle-like solution to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory with a massless scalar field. Here, we investigate the possible formation of a naked singularity in the JNW spacetime, using the thin-shell approximation to describe the gravitational collapse. By introducing different matter contents to construct thin-shells, we demonstrate the impossibility of naked singularity formation during the gravitational collapse unless the causality or null energy condition of the thin-shell is violated. Therefore, the weak cosmic censorship is satisfied even with the naked singularity of the JNW spacetime.</description>

      <title>Thermal, topological, and scattering effects of an AdS charged black hole with an antisymmetric tensor background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a spherically symmetric charged black hole with a cosmological constant under the influence of a Kalb--Ramond field background. We compute the photon sphere and shadow radii, validating our findings using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), with a particular emphasis on the shadow images of Sagittarius $A^{*}$. Furthermore, we investigate the \textit{greybody} factors, emission rate, and partial absorption cross section. It is shown that the Lorentz-violating parameter \(\bar{l}\) has an important effect on the absorption cross section. Our analysis also includes an examination of the topological charge, temperature-dependent topology, and generalized free energy. In particular, we regard the AdS charged black hole with an antisymmetric tensor background as a topological defect in the thermodynamic space, then the system has the same topological classification to the charged RN-AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Phase Transition in Charged Gauss-Bonnet Black Holes: A Holographic Thermodynamics Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the study of thermodynamics and phase transition of charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes within the context of anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, with particular emphasis on the central charge's role within the dual conformal field theory (CFT). We employ a holographic methodology that interprets the cosmological constant and the Newton constant as thermodynamic variables, leading to the derivation of a modified first law of thermodynamics that incorporates the thermodynamic volume and pressure. Our findings reveal that the central charge of the CFT is intrinsically linked to the variation of these constants, and its stability can be ensured by simultaneous adjustment of these constants. We further explore the phase structures of the black holes, utilizing the free energy. Our research uncovers the existence of a critical value of the central charge, beyond which the phase diagram displays a first-order phase transition between small and large black holes. We also delve into the implications of our findings on the complexity of the CFT. Our conclusions underscore the significant role of the central charge in the holographic thermodynamics and phase transition of charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes. Furthermore, we conclude that while the central charge considered provides suitable and satisfactory solutions for this black hole in 4 and 5 dimensions, it becomes necessary to introduce a unique central charge for this structure of modified gravity. In essence, the central charge in holographic thermodynamics is not a universal value and requires modification in accordance with different modified gravities. Consequently, the physics of the problem will significantly deviate from the one discussed in this article, indicating a rich and complex landscape for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the deflection of light produced by a topologically charged Holonomy corrected Schwarzschild black hole. The study is carried out both in the weak field limit and in the strong field limit. We analytically deduced the expansions for light deflection in the two limits and, from them, we determined the observables in order to provide elements so that observational tools are able to identify these solutions. We model possible gravitational scenarios in order to verify the possible gravitational characteristics of the solution.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>

      <title>Spin wave optics for gravitational waves lensed by a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03289v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves exhibit the unique signature of their spin-2 nature in processes of wave scattering, due to the interaction between spin and a background spacetime. Since the spin effect is more pronounced for longer wavelengths and gravitational waves sourced by binaries have a long wavelength, it may become an important effect in addition to the wave effect. We study the propagation of gravitational waves lensed by a Kerr black hole by numerically solving the Teukolsky equation with a source term of the equal-mass circular binary, taking into account both spin effect and wave effect. We find helicity-dependent small-period oscillation in the power spectrum of the amplification factor in the forward direction and the oscillation is enhanced as spin of a prograde Kerr black hole increases.</description>

      <title>Do holographic CFT states have unique semiclassical bulk duals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a situation where a holographic CFT state has multiple semiclassical bulk duals. In our example, a given holographic state has two simple, semiclassical descriptions, one with a closed universe, constructed using the gravitational path integral, and one without a closed universe, constructed using the extrapolate dictionary. This highlights an ambiguity in the AdS/CFT dictionary. We propose various options for resolving this tension although none are perfectly satisfactory. We also discuss what this implies for the black hole interior and the gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Spinning (A)dS Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massless spinning correlators in cosmology are extremely complicated. In contrast, the scattering amplitudes of massless particles with spin are very simple. We propose that the reason for the unreasonable complexity of these correlators lies in the use of inconvenient kinematic variables. For example, in de Sitter space, consistency with unitarity and the background isometries imply that the correlators must be conformally covariant and also conserved. However, the commonly used kinematic variables for correlators do not make all of these properties manifest. In this paper, we introduce twistor space as a powerful way to satisfy all kinematic constraints. We show that conformal correlators of conserved currents can be written as twistor integrals, where the conservation condition translates into holomorphicity of the integrand. The functional form of the twistor-space correlators is very simple and easily bootstrapped. For the case of three-point functions, we verify explicitly that this reproduces known results in embedding space. We also perform a half-Fourier transform of the twistor-space correlators to obtain their counterparts in momentum space. We conclude that twistors provide a promising new avenue to study conformal correlation functions that exposes their hidden simplicity.</description>

      <title>Thermal One-point Functions and Their Partial Wave Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we address partial wave decompositions of thermal one-point functions in conformal field theories on $S^1 \times S^{d-1}$. With the help of Casimir differential equations we develop efficient algorithms to compute the relevant conformal blocks for an external field of arbitrary spin and with any spin exchange along the thermal circle, at least in three dimensions. This is achieved by identifying solutions to the Casimir equations with a special class of spherical functions in the harmonic analysis of the conformal group. The resulting blocks are then applied to study the decomposition of one-point functions of the scalar $\phi^2$ and the stress tensor $T$ for a three-dimensional free scalar field $\phi$. We are able to read off averaged OPE coefficients into exchanged fields of high weight and spin for a complete set of tensor structures. We also extract an asymptotic behaviour of conformal blocks and use it to analyse the density of heavy-heavy-light OPE coefficients for spinning operators, comparing it with semi-classical predictions, such as the dimensions of operators at large charge.</description>

      <title>A critical reassessment of "Restricted Weyl Symmetry"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories have been proposed to be invariant under a larger class of transformations that take the form of local Weyl transformations supplemented by a restriction that the conformal factor satisfies a covariant Klein-Gordon equation. The action of these theories indeed seems to be invariant under such transformations up to boundary terms, this property being referred to as "restricted Weyl symmetry". However, we find that corresponding equations of motion are not invariant under these transformations. This is a paradox, that is explained by realizing that the restriction condition on the conformal factor forces the "restricted Weyl transformation" to be a nonlocal transformation. For nonlocal transformations would-be boundary terms cannot in general be discarded from the action. Moreover, variations of trajectories cannot be assumed to vanish at boundaries of the action when deriving equations of motion. We illustrate both of these less known properties by considering a series of simple examples. Finally, we apply these observations to the case of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories to demonstrate that "restricted Weyl transformations" are, in fact, not symmetries of the full system.</description>

      <title>Einstein Against Singularities: Analysis versus Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein identified singularities in spacetimes, such as at the Schwarzschild radius, where later relativists only find a coordinate system assigning multiple values to a single spacetime event. These differing judgments derive from differences in mathematical methods. Later relativists employ geometrical structures to correct anomalies in the coordinate systems used in analytic expressions. Einstein took the analytic expressions to be primary and the geometrical structures as mere heuristics that could be overruled if physical assumptions required it. Einstein's non-geometric methods had a firm base in the history of mathematical methods. They continued the non-geometric orientation of Christoffel, Ricci and LeviCivita. Einstein's insistence that singularities must be eliminated marked a departure from earlier tolerance of singularities. It was founded upon his longterm project of eliminating arbitrariness from fundamental physical theories. However, Einstein was willing to theorize with singularities only temporarily if they were the least arbitrary approach then available.</description>

      <title>Backreaction in Numerical Relativity: Averaging on Newtonian gauge-like hypersurfaces in Einstein Toolkit cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial averaging scheme and use it to study the evolution of spatial averages in large-scale simulations of cosmological structure formation performed with the Einstein Toolkit. The averages are performed on the spatial hypersurfaces of the simulation setup which, at least initially, represent the hypersurfaces of statistical homogeneity and isotropy. We find only negligible cosmic backreaction on these hypersurfaces even on very small scales, but find significant curvature fluctuations of up to $10\%$ in $\Omega_R$ for sub-volumes with radius $\sim200$ Mpc and even larger fluctuations in smaller sub-volumes. In addition, we quantify fluid flow in and out of these sub-volumes. We find this to be significant, up to a $5\%$ change in the density between redshift $z=1$ and $z=0$ of a single sphere of radius $\sim200$ Mpc (and larger for smaller spheres). We suggest this may be important for studies basing averages on volumes co-moving with the simulation hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Flat-Space Limit of Holographic Pseudo Entropy in (A)dS Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real part of pseudo entropy in conformal field theories is holographically calculated by the area of some extremal spacelike surfaces in the dual dS and AdS spacetimes. We show that the flat-space limit of these curves in three dimensional (A)dS spacetimes is well-defined. We find that if the length of the curves is calculated from the radial coordinate where the retarded time is extremum, then after taking the flat-space limit, the entanglement entropy of the dual theory of three-dimensional flat spacetime is obtained. For dS spacetime, the radial coordinate corresponding to the extremum of retarded time is located inside the cosmological horizon. Our results suggest that on the field theory side, the entanglement entropy in the dual theory of flat spacetimes should be obtained from the ultra-relativistic limit of pseudo entropy in the dual CFT to (A)ds spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: An in-depth analysis of GWs, LISA and its telescopes has been carried out in this paper, especially for the case in which all aberrations, except astigmatism and tilt are optimised. Though it is popular to neglect these two aberration types for their minute effect on the wavefront, a test of this negligence has been carried out in an extreme scenario of high phase noise. The relationship between phase noise and fringe visibility has been analysed, resulting in the discovery of an upper bound for allowed phase noise in LISA.</description>

      <title>Quintessential early dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a unified model of early and late dark energy. We call it {\it quintessential early dark energy} model in which early and late dark energy are explained by a single scalar field. In other words two different energy scales are related by a single scalar field potential. To achieve this we introduce the modified steep exponential potential. This potential has a hilltop nature during the early time which consists of a flat region followed by a steep region. This nature of the potential plays a crucial role in achieving early dark energy solution. During recent time, the potential can almost mimic the cosmological constant which can result into late time acceleration. We also constrain and compare the models for steep exponential, modified steep exponential, axionlike and power law potentials by using the available background cosmological data from CMB, BAO (including DESI DR1 2024), supernovae (Pantheon$+$, DESY5 and Union3) and Hubble parameter measurements. The maximum improvement we get in the present value of Hubble parameter compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is for the axionlike potential. For other potentials the constraints are similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Study of a Tilted Thin Accretion Disk around a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accreting collapsed object GRO J1655-40 could contain the gravitomagnetic monopole (GMM), and it was shown to be better described by the Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) spacetime instead of the Kerr spacetime. The warped accretion disk has also been observed for the same collapsed object. Motivated by these, we study a tilted thin inner accretion disk around a slowly-spinning KTN black hole that contains a small GMM. Such a tilting could have a significant effect on the X-ray spectral and timing features via the Lense-Thirring effect. Taking into account the contribution from the inner accretion disk for the KTN black hole, here we calculate the radial profile of a tilt angle. Depending on the numerical values of the viscosity of the accreting material and Kerr parameter, we show that the GMM tends the angular momentum of the disk to align along the black hole's spin axis, or to make it more tilted. Our solution for the radial profile of the tilted disk around a KTN black hole could be useful to probe the strong gravity regime, and could also give indirect evidence for the existence of GMM in nature.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Estimated Age of the Universe in Fractional Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our proposed cosmological framework, which is based on fractional quantum cosmology, aims to address the issue of synchronicity in the age of the universe. To achieve this, we have developed a new fractional $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. We obtained the necessary formalism by obtaining the fractional Hamiltonian constraint in a general minisuperspace. This formalism has allowed us to derive the fractional Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations for a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. Unlike the traditional de Sitter phase, our model exhibits a power-law accelerated expansion in the late-time universe, when vacuum energy becomes dominant. By fitting the model's parameters to cosmological observations, we determined that the fractional parameter of L\'{e}vy equals $\alpha=1.986$. Additionally, we have calculated the age of the universe to be 13.8196 Gyr. Furthermore, we have found that the ratio of the age to Hubble time from the present epoch to the distant future is finite and confined within the interval $0.9858\leq Ht&lt;95.238$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Perfect Fluids and Dark Side of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently we showed that in FLRW cosmology, the contribution from higher curvature terms in any generic metric gravity theory to the energy-momentum tensor is of the perfect fluid form. Such a geometric perfect fluid can be interpreted as a fluid remaining from the beginning of the universe where the string theory is thought to be effective. Just a short time after the beginning of the Universe, it is known that the Einstein-Hilbert action is assumed to be modified by adding all possible curvature invariants. We propose that the observed late-time accelerating expansion of the Universe can be solely driven by this geometric fluid. To support our claim, we specifically study the quadratic gravity field equations in $D$-dimensions. We show that the field equations of this theory for the FLRW metric possess a geometric perfect fluid source containing two critical parameters $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$. To analyze this theory concerning its parameter space $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)$, we obtain the general second-order nonlinear differential equation governing the late-time dynamics of the deceleration parameter $q$. Hence using some present-day cosmological data as our initial conditions, our findings for the $\sigma_2=0$ case are as follows: $ (i)$ In order to have a positive energy density for the geometric fluid $\rho_g$, the parameter $\sigma_1$ must be negative for all dimensions up to $D = 11$, $(ii)$ For a suitable choice of $\sigma_1$, the deceleration parameter experiences signature changes in the past and future, and in the meantime it lies within a negative range which means that the current observed accelerated expansion phase of the Universe can be driven solely by the curvature of the spacetime, $(iii)$ $q$ experiences a signature change and as the dimension $D$ of spacetime increases, this signature change happens at earlier and later times, in the past and future, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study topology-changing spacetimes occurring from pointlike sources. Following an old idea of Penrose, we will opt for a non-Hausdorff model of topology change in which an initial pointlike source is ``doubled" and allowed to propagate along null rays into an eventual cobordism. By appealing to recent developments in non-Hausdorff differential geometry, we will describe and evaluate gravitational actions on these topology-changing spacetimes. Motivated by analogous results for the Trousers space, we describe a sign convention for Lorentzian angles that will ensure the dampening of our non-Hausdorff topology-changing spacetimes within a two-dimensional path integral for gravity.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, especially the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular, the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral tilt of the cosmological perturbations limit the $\alpha$ parameter of the potentials to values such that $\alpha_{n=0} \lesssim 10$, $\alpha_{n=1} \lesssim 17$ and $\alpha_{n=2} \lesssim 67$, for the $\alpha$ attractors T, E, and $n=2$ models, respectively. Using the constraints on the minimal amount of e-folds of expansion from the quantum bounce up to the end of inflation leads to the upper bounds for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for the $\alpha$-attractor models studied in this work: $\gamma_{n=0} \lesssim 51.2$, $\gamma_{n=1}\lesssim 63.4$ and $\gamma_{n=2} \lesssim 64.2$, which are obtained when fixing the parameter $\alpha$ in the potential at the values saturating the upper bounds given above for each model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study propagation of the high frequency electromagnetic waves in a curved spacetime. We discuss a so call spinoptics approach which generalizes a well known geometric optics approximation and allows one to take into account spin-dependent corrections. A new element proposed in this work is the use of effective action which allows one to derive spinoptics equations. This method is simpler and more transparent than the earlier proposed methods. It is explicitly covariant and can be applied to an arbitrary spacetime background. We also demonstrate how the initial value problem for the high frequency electromagnetiv wave can be soled in the developed spinoptics approximation.</description>

      <title>Exploring modified Kaniadakis entropy: MOND theory and the Bekenstein bound conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the potential of Kaniadakis entropy to describe black-hole entropy, proposing a modified version accounting for black hole thermodynamics. We posit a conjecture that the Kaniadakis entropy precisely describes the Bekenstein-Hawking black-hole entropy. Additionally, we discuss the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory, a modification of Newton's second law aimed at explaining galaxy rotation curves without resorting to dark matter. Furthermore, we consider the Bekenstein bound conjecture which imposes an upper limit on the entropy of confined quantum systems. We analyze this conjecture in the context of a modified Kaniadakis entropy and find that it holds for typical values of $\kappa$, as evidenced by our numerical investigation. Our exploration underscores the potential of a modified Kaniadakis statistics in understanding diverse physical phenomena, from gravitational systems to quantum mechanics, offering a promising direction for future research at the intersection of statistical mechanics and other important areas of physics as well.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>Non-perpetual Eternal Inflation and the Emergent de Sitter Swampland Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel correlation, $n_s$ - $\Delta N$, connecting CMB parameters to the required total e-folds for eternal inflation. This correlation provides a robust tool for evaluating eternal (string) inflation models using CMB data and explores the impact of quantum fluctuations on non-attractor phases. By generalizing eternal inflation criteria, our parameterization simplifies rigorous testing of predictions and reveals a link between refined de Sitter conjecture parameters and the eternal nature of the cosmic landscape. This points to a general tendency towards eternal behavior in low-energy effective field theories within the landscape, opening the possibility for our cosmic stage to potentially embrace a 'multiverse' scenario.</description>

      <title>Black holes and gravitational waves from slow phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow first-order phase transitions generate large inhomogeneities that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum then consists of a primary component sourced by bubble collisions and a secondary one induced by large perturbations. The latter gives the dominant peak if $\beta/H_0 &lt; 12$, impacting, in particular, the interpretation of the recent PTA data. The GW signal associated with a particular PBH population is stronger than in typical scenarios because of a negative non-Gaussianity of the perturbations and it has a distinguishable shape with two peaks.</description>

      <title>A simple prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in Brans-Dicke gravity from linear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brans-Dicke (BD), one of the first proposed scalar-tensor theories of gravity, effectively makes the gravitational constant of general relativity (GR) time-dependent. Constraints on the BD parameter $\omega$ serve as a benchmark for testing GR, which is recovered in the limit $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. Current small-scale astrophysical constraints $\omega \gtrsim 10^5$ are much tighter than large-scale cosmological constraints $\omega \gtrsim 10^3$, but the two decouple if the true theory of gravity features screening. On the largest cosmological scales, BD approximates the most general second-order scalar-tensor (Horndeski) theory, so constraints here have wider implications. These constraints will improve with upcoming large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background surveys. To constrain BD with weak gravitational lensing, one needs its nonlinear matter power spectrum $P_\mathrm{BD}$. By comparing the boost $B = P_\mathrm{BD}/P_\mathrm{GR}$ from linear theory and nonlinear $N$-body simulations, we show that the nonlinear boost can simply be predicted from linear theory if the BD and GR universes are parameterized in a way that makes their early cosmological evolution and quasilinear power today similar. In particular, they need the same $H_0 / \sqrt{\smash[b]{G_{\rm eff}(a=0)}}$ and $\sigma_8$, where $G_{\rm eff}$ is the (effective) gravitational strength. Our prediction is $1\%$ accurate for $\omega \geq 100$, $z \leq 3$, and $k \leq 1\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$; and $2\%$ up to $k \leq 5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. It also holds for $G_\mathrm{BD}$ that do not match Newton's constant today, so one can study GR with different gravitational constants $G_\mathrm{GR}$ by sending $\omega \rightarrow \infty$. We provide a code that computes $B$ with the linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver hi_class and multiplies it by the nonlinear $P_\mathrm{GR}$ from EuclidEmulator2 to predict $P_\mathrm{BD}$.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

      <title>On the Charge Algebra of Causal Diamonds in Three Dimensional Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariant phase space methods are applied to the analysis of a causal diamond in 2+1-dimensional pure Einstein gravity. It is found that the reduced phase space is parametrized by a family of charges with a dual geometrical interpretation: they are geometric observables on the corner of the diamond, and they generate diffeomorphisms. The Poisson brackets among them close into an algebra. Knowledge of the corner charges therefore permits reconstruction of the diamond geometry, which realizes a form of local holography. The results are contrasted with the literature, and the path to a quantum description of spacetime geometry is discussed.</description>

      <title>Locally Scale Invariant Chern-Simons Actions in 3+1 Dimensions and Their Emergence From 4+2 Dimensional 2T-Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional Chern-Simons (CS) terms in 3+1 dimensions that modify General Relativity (GR), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), typically lack scale invariance. However, a locally scale invariant and geodesically complete framework for the Standard Model (SM) coupled to GR was previously constructed by employing a tailored form of local scale (Weyl) symmetry. This refined SM+GR model closely resembles the conventional SM in subatomic realms where gravitational effects are negligible. Nevertheless, it offers an intriguing prediction: the emergence of new physics beyond the traditional SM and GR near spacetime singularities, characterized by intense gravity and substantial deviations in the Higgs field. In this study, we expand upon the enhanced SM+GR by incorporating Weyl invariant CS terms for gravity, QCD, and QED in 3+1 dimensions, thereby integrating CS contributions within the locally scale-invariant and geodesically complete paradigm. Additionally, we establish a holographic correspondence between the new CS terms in 3+1 dimensions and novel 4+2 dimensional CS-type actions within 2T-physics. We demonstrate that the Weyl transformation in 3+1 dimensions arises from 4+2 general coordinate transformations, which unify the hidden extra 1+1 large (not curled up) dimensions with the evident 3+1 dimensions. By leveraging the newfound local conformal symmetry, the augmented and geodesically complete SM+GR+CS introduces innovative tools and perspectives for exploring classical field theory aspects of black hole and cosmological singularities in 3+1 dimensions, while the 4+2 dimensional connection unveils deeper facets of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linearised gravity has magnetic charges carried by (linearised) Kaluza-Klein monopoles. A gauge-invariant expression is found for these charges that is similar to Penrose's gauge-invariant expression for the ADM charges. A systematic search is made for other gauge-invariant charges.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>
