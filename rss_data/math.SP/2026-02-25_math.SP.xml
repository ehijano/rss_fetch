      <title>Improved fractal Weyl bounds matching improved spectral gaps for hyperbolic surfaces and open quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new fractal Weyl upper bound for the high-energy distribution of resonances of convex co-compact hyperbolic surfaces which matches the improved spectral gap given by Fourier decay. This improves upon the fractal Weyl bound of Dyatlov which matches the Patterson-Sullivan spectral gap. We also give a new resolvent estimate improving the ones given by Dyatlov-Zahl and Dyatlov. Analogous results are obtained for quantum open baker's maps, improving an estimate of Dyatlov-Jin, where we also give an improved fractal Weyl bound matching a spectral gap given by additive energy estimates. We refine known methods for proving fractal Weyl bounds which reduce the problem to an estimate of a certain determinant function; however, we use a different determinant function which allows us to make sharper estimates by applying the methods of proof of the fractal uncertainty principle in each setting.</description>

      <title>Non-negative persymmetric realizability of certain classes of spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the collection of scalars that represent a non-negative matrix's eigenvalues is known as the non-negative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP). Conditions for the existence of a non-negative matrix with a certain spectrum are examined in this work. The classical NIEP restricted to non-negative matrices having a persymmetric structure is the persymmetric non-negative inverse eigenvalue problem (PNIEP). We resolve the open problem stated in \cite{Ana}, and furthermore, equivalence of the PNIEP and NIEP is established for trace-zero spectra of five complex numbers. Also we obtain new sufficient conditions for the realizability of certain classes of spectra with non-negative persymmetric matrix realization. Based on generic structural features of persymmetric matrices and their characteristic polynomials, our method is constructive in nature. The effects of perturbations on imaginary part of complex eigenvalues are also analyzed and some perturbation results are derived.</description>

      <title>t-Hermitian Forms of Arbitrary Degree, Their Spectral Structure, and Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $t$-Hermitian forms of arbitrary degree $k$, a natural extension of classical degree $k$ Hermitian forms obtained through a synthesis of the tensor transformation law and the $t$-product of third-order tensors. We show that degree $k$ $t$-Hermitian forms uniquely correspond to order $2k+1$ Hermitian tensors arising as canonical representatives within the $^*$-algebra of Hermitian tensors equipped with the $t$-product/$t$-Einstein product. Applying the discrete Fourier transform, their corresponding $t$-Hermitian forms decompose into collections of classical degree $k$ Hermitian forms. This decomposition yields a universal lifting property, allowing arbitrary collections of degree $k$ Hermitian forms to be viewed as a single structured object which preserves fundamental properties such as Hermitian positive-definiteness.
  For a distinguished class of $t$-Hermitian forms, which we refer to as commutant $t$-Hermitian forms, we establish a spectral theory extending the classical spectral characterization of Hermitian tensors. In particular, we relate Hermitian positive-definiteness to two distinct classes of eigenvalues: the tensor eigenvalues of each frontal slice of the form's corresponding tensor, and matrix eigenvalues obtained after unfolding each of these slices into matrices. Indeed, we prove that the tensor eigenvalues characterize Hermitian positive-definiteness; moreover, positivity of the matrix eigenvalues implies Hermitian positive-definiteness, however the converse fails in general.
  Together, these results provide a unified framework for structured interactions among higher-degree Hermitian forms and lay the groundwork for further study, especially with regards to the consequences of the spectral hierarchy of positivity inherent in this setting.</description>

      <title>Low eigenvalues of the $p-$Laplacian in general open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the minmax Ljusternik-Schnirelmann levels of the constrained $p-$Dirichlet integral, on a general open set of the Euclidean space. We show that, whenever one of these levels lies below the threshold given by the $L^p$ Poincar\'e constant ``at infinity'', it actually defines an eigenvalue of the Dirichlet $p-$Laplacian. We also prove an exponential decay at infinity for the relevant eigenfunctions: this can be seen as a \v{S}nol-Simon--type estimate for the nonlinear case. Finally, we exhibit some peculiar examples of unbounded open sets to which our main result applies.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Spectral Encodings under Weyl Growth Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the geometric Weyl bulk-density exponent $(d-2)/2$ rigidifies spectral encodings $C=\pi-\phi(\lambda)$ in the O-regularly varying class: the bulk power law forces $\phi\in\mathrm{RV}_1$ (asymptotic linearity). For polynomial-type encodings $C=\pi-\epsilon\lambda^k L(\lambda)$ with $L\in\mathrm{RV}_0$, this yields the unique admissible exponent $k=1$. The affine encoding then gives $N_{\mu_C}(C)\sim\gamma_d\,\epsilon^{-d/2}(\pi-C)^{d/2}$ as $C\to-\infty$, allowing recovery of $d$ and $\gamma_d$ from bulk encoded data. This transfer is stable under perturbations $\delta(\lambda)=o(\lambda)$, with explicit slowly varying error control. We further formalize asymptotic spectral equivalence classes: if $\phi\in\mathrm{RV}_k$, the induced map scales asymptotic spectral dimension as $d_{\mathrm{as}}\mapsto d_{\mathrm{as}}/k$; hence dimension preservation is equivalent to $\phi\in\mathrm{RV}_1$, with strict affine normalization at first order when $L(\lambda)\to1$.</description>

      <title>CLT for the trace functional of the IDS of magnetic random Schr\"{o}dinger operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the existence of the integrated density of states (IDS) of the magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a random potential on the Hilbert space \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \), as an analogue of the law of large numbers (LLN) for trace functionals. In this work, we establish an analogue of the central limit theorem (CLT), which describes the fluctuations of the trace functionals of the IDS, for a class of test functions denoted by \( C^1_{d,0}(\mathbb{R}) \). This class consists of real-valued, continuously differentiable functions on \( \mathbb{R} \) that decay at the rate \( O(|x|^{-m}) \) as \( |x| \to \infty \), where \( m &gt; d + 1 \).</description>

      <title>An improved upper bound for the second eigenvalue on tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the maximization problem of the second non-zero Laplace eigenvalue $\lambda_2(T,g)$ on a torus $T$, among all unit-area metrics in a fixed conformal class. First, we obtain a new upper bound for $\lambda_2(T_{a,b},g)$ on any flat torus $T_{a, b}$ with $(a, b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$. Our bound improves the general estimate $\lambda_2(T_{a, b},g)\le 4A_c(T_{a, b}, [g])$ in the case of the torus. As applications, we derive a uniform upper bound $\lambda_2(T,g)&lt; \frac{16\pi^2}{\sqrt{3}}$ for any torus $T$ and any metric $g$, and reduce the Kao-Lai-Osting conjecture to proving an upper bound for $\lambda_2(T_{a,b},g)$ on the specific family of flat tori $T_{a,b}$ with $0\leq a\leq \frac12$ and $\sqrt{1-a^2}\leq b\leq 1.76$.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for generalized spectral characterization of graphs with loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficient conditions for a simple graph to be characterized up to isomorphism given its spectrum and the spectrum of its complement graph are known due to Wang and Xu. This note establishes a related sufficient condition in the presence of loops: if the walk matrix has square-free determinant, then the graph is characterized by its generalized spectrum. The proof includes a general result about symmetric integral matrices.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the First Non-zero Basic Eigenvalue on a Singular Riemannian Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>
