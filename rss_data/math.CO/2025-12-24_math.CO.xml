      <title>Graph Sensitivity under Join and Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity, $\sigma(G)$, of a finite undirected simple graph $G$ is the smallest maximum degree of an induced subgraph on more than the maximum number of independent vertices. Call an indexed family of graphs $G_n$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G_n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ sensitive if $\sigma(G_n) \to \infty$, and insensitive otherwise. We describe sensitivity under the join operation and decomposition into stable blocks and construct sensitive and insensitive, primarily non-regular, graph families. We determine the sensitivity explicitly for numerous singly- and doubly-indexed graph families, including certain generalized joins - e.g., complete multipartite graphs and some generalized windmill graphs; general rooted products; and families of corona graphs.</description>

      <title>Completely independent Steiner trees and corresponding tree connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $S$-Steiner tree packing problem provides mathematical foundations for optimizing multi-path information transmission, particularly in designing fault-tolerant parallelized routing architectures for massive-scale network infrastructures. In this article, we propose the definitions of completely independent $S$-Steiner trees (CISSTs for short) and generalized $k^*$-connectivity, which generalize the definitions of internally disjoint $S$-Steiner trees and generalized $k$-connectivity. Given a connected graph $G = (V,E)$ and a vertex subset $S\subseteq V, |S|\geq 2,$ an $S$-Steiner tree of $G$ is a subtree in $G$ that spans all nodes in $S.$ The $S$-Steiner trees $T_1,T_2,\cdots, T_k$ of $G$ are completely independent pairwise if for any $1\leq p&lt;q\leq k,$ $E(T_p)\cap E(T_q)=\emptyset$ , $V(T_p)\cap V(T_q)=S,$ and for any two vertices $x_{1},x_{2}$ in $S$, the paths connecting $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ in $T_p,T_q$ are pairwise internally disjoint. The packing number of CISSTs, denoted by $\kappa^*_G(S),$ is the maximum number of CISSTs in $G.$ The generalized $k^*$-connectivity $\kappa_k^*(G)$ is the minimum $\kappa_G^*(S)$ for $S$ ranges over all $k$-subsets of $V(G).$ We provide a detailed characterization of CISSTs. Also, we investigate the CISSTs of complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we determine the generalized $k^*$-connectivity for complete graphs and give a tight lower bound of the generalized $k^*$-connectivity for complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius and size conditions for fractional $(a,b,m)$-covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fractional $(a,b,m)$-covered graph is a generalization of the concept of a fractional $[a,b]$-covered graph. For any $H \subseteq G$ with edge set $|E(H)| = m$, if there exists a fractional $[a,b]$-factor (the corresponding fractional indicator function is $h$) such that $h(e) = 1$ for any $e \in H$, then the graph $G$ is called a fractional $(a,b,m)$-covered graph. In this paper, we characterize the conditions for a graph to be a fractional $(a,b,m)$-covered graph from the perspectives of spectral radius and size, respectively.</description>

      <title>The List Linear Arboricity of Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (directed) linear forest is a (di)graph whose components are (directed) paths. The linear arboricity $la(F)$ of a (di)graph $F$ is the minimum number of (directed) linear forests required to decompose its edges. Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary (1980) proposed the Linear Arboricity Conjecture that $la(G) \leq \left\lceil \frac{\Delta+1}{2}\right\rceil$ for any graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$. The current best known bound, due to Lang and Postle (2023), establishes $la(G) \leq \frac{\Delta}{2} + 3\sqrt{\Delta} \log^4 \Delta$ for sufficiently large $\Delta$. And they proved this in the stronger list setting proposed by An and Wu.
  For a digraph $D$, let its maximum degree $\Delta(D)$ be the maximum of all in-degrees and out-degrees of its vertices. Nakayama and P\'{e}roche (1987) conjectured that $la(D) \leq \Delta(D)+1$ for every digraph $D$. We extend Lang and Postle's result to digraphs with a matching error term. We show that $la(D) \leq\Delta + 6\sqrt{\Delta} \log^4 \Delta$ for any digraph $D$ with $\Delta = \Delta(D)$ sufficiently large. Moreover, we also establish this bound in the stronger list setting, where each arc $e \in A(D)$ is assigned a list of colors, and each arc is assigned a color from its list such that each color class forms a directed linear forest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any integer $r\ge 2$, there exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for every sufficiently large integer $n$, every $((r-1)n+1)$-regular graph $G$ on $rn$ vertices has at least $c2^{rn}$ subsets $S\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G[S]$ contains a $K_r$-factor. This confirms a conjecture of Dragani\'c, Keevash and M\"uyesser for large $n$ [Cyclic subsets in regular Dirac graphs. Int. Math. Res. Not., 2025(14): 1-16, 2025].</description>

      <title>A Proof of a conjecture of Watanabe--Yoshida via Ehrhart Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2005, Watanabe and Yoshida formulated a conjecture for a lower bound of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of local rings that was recently settled by Meng using analytic methods. More recently, Pak-Shapiro-Smirnov-Yoshida used Ehrhart theory to compute explicitly the multiplicity and reduced the conjecture to showing an inequality of the values of the Ehrhart polynomial of a zigzag poset shifted to $t - 1/2$. We completely realize their approach to give another proof of this Watanabe--Yoshida conjecture. The main ingredient of the proof relies on a new explicit combinatorial formula for the coefficients of this shifted Ehrhart polynomial. In terms of the generating function of the shifted polynomial, this formula manifests itself as a Hadamard product of the exponential generating function of Euler numbers and an explicit algebraic function.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the combinatorial structure of $m$-colored mutation classes. We provide an explicit and purely combinatorial description of the $m$-colored quivers that arise within the $m$-colored mutation class of a quiver of type $\mathbb{\widetilde{A}}$. Our results generalize and extend existing work, specifically recovering a description by Bastian [1] when the case $m=1$ is considered.</description>

      <title>Sign-reversing involutions in moduli spaces of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use sign-reversing involutions to solve two computational problems that arise naturally in the geometry of moduli spaces of curves. In particular, we give an explicit combinatorial formula for arbitrary $\psi$ class intersection products on the genus zero multicolored spaces $\overline{M}_{0,[r_1,\ldots,r_m]}$ using a novel sign reversing involution on decorated diagrams. As an application, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for when these intersection products are nonzero in terms of matchings on graphs.
  We also calculate the analog of the tropical Euler characteristic for the graphical moduli spaces $\overline{M}_{0,\Gamma}$ for graphs with two dominant vertices $P, Q$, by constructing two new sign-reversing involutions to simplify the sum. We show that (up to sign) it is the number of acyclic orientations of $\Gamma \smallsetminus \{P, Q\}$.</description>

      <title>On Link-irregular Digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of link-irregular graphs to directed graphs (digraphs), where a digraph is link-irregular if no two vertices have isomorphic directed links. We establish that link-irregular digraphs exist on $n$ vertices if and only if $n \geq 5$, and prove that their underlying graphs must contain 3-cycles. We conjecture that link-irregular tournaments exist if and only if $n \geq 6$, providing explicit constructions for $n \leq 8$ and computational verification for $n \leq 100$. We derive lower bounds on the minimum degree and outdegree required for link-irregularity, establish that almost all link-irregular digraphs are nonplanar, and prove that any link-irregular orientable graph admits a link-irregular labeling. Additionally, we construct explicit examples of link-irregular digraphs with constant outdegree and regular tournaments.</description>

      <title>Framing Lattices and Flow Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow polytopes of acyclic oriented graphs arise naturally in combinatorial optimization, and the study of their volumes and triangulations has revealed intriguing connections across combinatorics, geometry, algebra, and representation theory. In this work, we introduce the framing lattice associated with a framed graph, whose Hasse diagram is dual to a framed triangulation of the corresponding flow polytope. Framing lattices are remarkable in that they provide a unifying framework encompassing many classical and well-studied lattice structures, including the Boolean lattice, the Tamari lattice, and the weak order on permutations. They further subsume a broad array of examples such as all type-A Cambrian lattices, the Grassmann and grid-Tamari lattices, the alt-$\nu$-Tamari and cross-Tamari lattices, the permutree lattices, and the $\tau$-tilting posets of certain gentle algebras. We show, among several foundational structural properties, that the framing lattice is a semidistributive, congruence uniform, and polygonal lattice, with its polygons consisting of squares, pentagons, and hexagons. We study its connections to noncrossing partitions via Reading's core label orders, simple representations of its join and meet irreducible elements, and several of its lattice congruences and quotients induced by a graph operation called an M-move.</description>

Abstract: We characterize subsets of highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals that arise as unions of Demazure crystals, for any symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We provide a local characterization for these subsets and prove they admit disjoint decompositions into Demazure atoms. As a consequence, we give a new characterization for when a subset of a highest weight crystal is a Demazure crystal as well as a crystal-theoretic proof that any Polo module admits a relative Schubert filtration.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of returns to the coordinate hyperplanes for conditioned simple random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the number of returns to the coordinate hyperplanes for multidimensional nearest-neighbour random walks. While one-dimensional results on returns are classical, much less is known in higher dimensions. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of returns under several natural conditionings: the unconditioned walk, bridges, meanders, and non-negative bridges (or excursions). Our main results characterize the limiting distributions under appropriate rescaling. The resulting one-dimensional marginals may be half-normal, Rayleigh, geometric, negative binomial, or certain mixtures thereof. In most situations, the coordinates are asymptotically independent; however, there are notable exceptions for the meander case, depending on the drift. The proofs rely on conditioning on the numbers of horizontal and vertical steps, which restores a form of independence and reduces the problem to one-dimensional estimates via binomial convolution and Bernstein-type approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the size of the convoy in the speed process in the multi-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). Through a coupling argument, we obtain an exact formula for the expected convoy size by relating it to a combinatorial structure. We prove that the asymptotic expected convoy size is universal for all fixed jump rates $q \in [0,1)$. In the special case $q=0$, we upgrade this to full convergence in distribution. We further establish a critical scaling $q = 1 - \gamma/\sqrt{n}$ that yields a nontrivial limiting regime. Our analysis builds on Martin's construction of the convoy and makes use of an orthogonal-polynomial representation of random-walk transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>Methods for Analyzing RNA Pseudoknots via Chord Diagrams and Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA molecules are known to form complex secondary structures including pseudoknots. A systematic framework for the enumeration, classification and prediction of secondary structures is critical to determine the biological significance of the molecular configurations of RNA. Chord diagrams are mathematical objects widely used to represent RNA secondary structures and to analyze structural motifs, however a mathematically rigorous enumeration of pseudoknots remains a challenge. We introduce a method that incorporates a distance-based metric $\tau$ to analyze the intersection graph of a chord diagram associated with a pseudoknotted structure. In particular, our method formally defines a pseudoknot in terms of a weighted vertex cover of a certain intersection graph constructed from a partition of the chord diagram representing the nucleotide sequence of the RNA molecule. In this graph-theoretic context, we introduce a rigorous algorithm that enumerates pseudoknots, classifies secondary structures, and is sensitive to three-dimensional topological features. We implement our methods in MATLAB and test the algorithm on pseudoknotted structures from the bpRNA-1m database. Our findings confirm that genus is a robust quantifier of pseudoknot complexity.</description>

Abstract: Fix an integer $k\ge 3$. Call a set $A\subseteq [N]$ LCM-$k$-free if it does not contain distinct $a_1,\dots,a_k$ such that $\mathrm{lcm}(a_i,a_j)$ is the same for all $1\le i&lt;j\le k$. Define $$ f_k(N):=\max\left\{\sum_{a\in A}\frac1a: A\subseteq [N] \text{ is LCM-$k$-free}\right\}. $$ Addressing a problem of Erd\H{o}s, we prove an explicit unconditional lower bound $$ f_k(N)\ge (\log N)^{c_k-o(1)}, \qquad c_k:=\frac{k-2}{e((k-2)!)^{1/(k-2)}}. $$ Let $F_k(n)$ denote the maximum size of a $k$-sunflower-free family of subsets of $[n]$, and define the Erd\H{o}s--Szemer\'edi $k$-sunflower-free capacity by $\mu_k^{\mathrm S}:=\limsup_{n\to\infty}F_k(n)^{1/n}$. Motivated by a remark of Erd\H{o}s relating this problem to the sunflower conjecture, we show that $$ (\log N)^{\log\mu_k^{\mathrm S}-o(1)} \le f_k(N) \ll (\log N)^{\mu_k^{\mathrm S}-1+o(1)}. $$ Furthermore, we show that the Erd\H{o}s--Szemer\'edi sunflower conjecture fails for this fixed $k$ (i.e. $\mu_k^{\mathrm S}=2$) if and only if $f_k(N)=(\log N)^{1-o(1)}$.</description>

      <title>A Lov\'asz theta lower bound on Quantum Max Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a lower bound to quantum Max Cut of a graph in terms of the Lov\'asz theta function of its complement. For a graph with $m$ edges, $\text{qmc}(G) \geq \tfrac{m}{4}\big( 1 + \tfrac{8}{3\pi}\tfrac{1}{\vartheta(\bar{G}) -1} \big)$, with the bound achieved by a product state. The proof extends a result by Balla, Janzer, and Sudakov on classical Max Cut and is also inspired by the randomized rounding method of Gharibian and Parekh. The bound outperforms the classical bound when applied to quantum Max Cut.</description>

      <title>Up-down chains and scaling limits: application to permuton- and graphon-valued diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An up-down chain is a Markov chain in which each transition is a two-step process that moves up to a larger object and then back down to an object of the original size. The first goal of this paper is to present a general framework for analyzing these chains and computing their scaling limits. This approach unifies much of the existing literature while extending it in several directions. These include explicit conditions for constructing integrable up-down chains and convergence results for families of intertwined processes. The latter contribute to the method of intertwiners of Borodin and Olshanski.
  The second goal is to highlight a notable application of this framework to the settings of permutations and graphs. Here, we identify some integrable up-down chains and construct their scaling limits, a family of permuton- and graphon-valued Feller diffusions. Both the up-down chains and the limiting diffusions exhibit ergodicity, diagonalizable semigroups, and explicit expressions for the maximal separation distance to stationarity. For the diffusions, the stationary measures are the recursive separable permutons and recursive cographons recently introduced by the authors, and the separation distances turn out to be related to the Dedekind eta function.</description>

      <title>Single-element extensions of matroids over skew tracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.05683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matroids over skew tracts provide an algebraic framework simultaneously generalizing the notions of linear subspaces, matroids, oriented matroids, phased matroids, and some other ``matroids with extra structure". A single-element extension of a matroid $\mathcal{M}$ over a skew tract $T$ is a matroid $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$ over $T$ obtained from $\mathcal{M}$ by adding one more element. Crapo characterized single-element extensions of ordinary matroids, and Las Vergnas characterized single-element extensions of oriented matroids, in terms of single-element extensions of their rank 2 contractions. The results of Crapo and Las Vergnas do not generalize to matroids over skew tracts, but we will show a necessary and sufficient condition on skew tracts, called Pathetic Cancellation, such that the result can generalize to weak matroids over skew tracts.
  Stringent skew hyperfields are a special case of skew tracts which behave in many ways like skew fields. We find a characterization of single-element extensions of strong matroids over stringent skew hyperfields.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Numbers through the Lenses of Polynomial Ideals and Nullstellens\"atze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the Ramsey numbers $R(r,s)$ through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. We give polynomial encodings whose solutions correspond to Ramsey graphs of order $n$, those that do not contain a copy of $K_r$ or $\bar{K}_s$. When these systems have no solution and $n \ge R(r,s)$, we construct Nullstellensatz certificates whose degrees are equal to the restricted online Ramsey numbers introduced by Conlon, Fox, Grinshpun and He. Moreover, we show that these results generalize to other numbers in Ramsey theory, including Rado, van der Waerden, and Hales-Jewett numbers. Finally, we introduce a family of numbers that relate to the coefficients of a certain "Ramsey polynomial" that gives lower bounds for Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Boundedness for proper conflict-free and odd colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper conflict-free chromatic number, $\chi_{pcf}(G)$, of a graph $G$ is the least $k$ such that $G$ has a proper $k$-coloring in which for each non-isolated vertex there is a color appearing exactly once among its neighbors. The proper odd chromatic number, $\chi_{o}(G)$, of $G$ is the least $k$ such that $G$ has a proper coloring in which for every non-isolated vertex there is a color appearing an odd number of times among its neighbors. We say that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded ($\chi_{o}$-bounded) if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi_{pcf}(G) \leq f(\chi(G))$ ($\chi_{o}(G) \leq f(\chi(G))$) for every $G \in \mathcal{G}$. Caro et al. (2022) asked for classes that are linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded ($\chi_{pcf}$-bounded), and as a starting point, they showed that every claw-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le 2\Delta(G)+1$, which implies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le 4\chi(G)+1$.
  In this paper, we improve the bound for claw-free graphs to a nearly tight bound by showing that such a graph $G$ satisfies $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le \Delta(G)+6$, and even $\chi_{pcf}(G) \le \Delta(G)+4$ if it is a quasi-line graph. These results also give evidence for a conjecture by Caro et al. Moreover, we show that convex-round graphs and permutation graphs are linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded. For these last two results, we prove a lemma that reduces the problem of deciding if a hereditary class is linearly $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded to deciding if the bipartite graphs in the class are $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded by an absolute constant. This lemma complements a theorem of Liu (2022) and motivates us to study boundedness in bipartite graphs. In particular, we show that biconvex bipartite graphs are $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded while convex bipartite graphs are not even $\chi_o$-bounded, and exhibit a class of bipartite circle graphs that is linearly $\chi_o$-bounded but not $\chi_{pcf}$-bounded.</description>

      <title>A weighted Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $(P, w)$-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $(P, w)$-partition generating function $K_{(P,w)}(x)$ is a quasisymmetric function obtained from a labeled poset. Recently, Liu and Weselcouch gave a formula for the coefficients of $K_{(P,w)}(x)$ when expanded in the quasisymmetric power sum function basis. This formula generalizes the classical Murnaghan--Nakayama rule for Schur functions.
  We extend this result to weighted $(P, w)$-partitions and provide a short combinatorial proof, avoiding the Hopf algebra machinery used by Liu--Weselcouch.</description>

      <title>Stanley-Reisner ideals of higher independence complexes of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $t\geq 2$, the $t$-independence complex $\mathrm{Ind}_t(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the collection of all $A\subseteq V(G)$ such that each connected component of the induced subgraph $G[A]$ has at most $t-1$ vertices. The topology of $\mathrm{Ind}_t(G)$ is intimately related to the combinatorial property of $G$. In this article, we consider the Stanley-Reisner ideal $J_{t}(G)$ of $\mathrm{Ind}_t(G)$ and focus on its algebraic properties. We prove that for a chordal graph $G$ and for all $t$
  \[
  \mathrm{reg}(R/J_{t}(G))=(t-1)\nu_{t}(G) \text{ and } \mathrm{pd}(R/J_{t}(G))=\mathrm{bight}(J_{t}(G)),
  \]
  where $\nu_{t}(G)$ denotes the induced matching number of the corresponding hypergraph of $J_{t}(G)$, and $\mathrm{reg}$, $\mathrm{pd}$ and $\mathrm{bight}$ stand for the regularity, projective dimension, and big height, respectively. As a consequence of the above results, we combinatorially characterize when the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the $t$-independence complex of a chordal graph has a linear resolution as well as when it satisfies the Cohen-Macaulay property. The above formulas and their consequences can be seen as a nice generalization of the classical results corresponding to the edge ideals of chordal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if $\chi(G)=k$, but $\chi(G')&lt;k$ for every proper induced subgraph $G'$ of $G$. For a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, $G$ is $\mathcal{F}$-free if no graph $F \in \mathcal{F}$ is an induced subgraph of $G$. We show that there are exactly three 4-vertex-critical $\{P_7,C_3\}$-free graphs containing an induced $C_7$, thereby settling the first of the two cases of a conjecture by Goedgebeur and Schaudt [J.~Graph Theory, 87:188--207, 2018]. Moreover, we show that all $\{P_5+P_1,C_3\}$-free graphs are $3$-colorable and by combining our result with known results from the literature, we completely characterize the maximum chromatic number of $\{F,C_3\}$-free graphs if $F$ is a six-vertex induced subgraph of $P_7$. Finally, we construct an infinite family of $4$-vertex-critical $\{4K_2,C_3\}$-free graphs. These graphs are also $\{P_{11},C_3\}$-free and this is the first value of $t$ for which an infinite family of $4$-vertex-critical $\{P_{t},C_3\}$-free graphs is known.</description>

Abstract: Chordal graphs and chordal bigraphs enjoy beautiful characterizations, in terms of forbidden subgraphs, vertex/edge orderings, vertex/edge separating sets, and tree-like representations. In this paper, we introduce chordal signed graphs and chordal signed bigraphs. Interestingly, chordal signed graphs are equivalent to strict chordal digraphs studied by Hell and Hern\'andez-Cruz. A forbidden subdigraph characterization of strict chordal digraphs can be translated to a forbidden subgraph characterization of chordal signed graphs. We give a forbidden subgraph characterization of chordal signed bigraphs. The forbidden subgraphs for chordal signed bigraphs are analogous to those for chordal signed graphs but the proofs are much more complicated and intriguing.</description>

Abstract: We employ combinatorial techniques to present an explicit formula for the coefficients in front of Chern classes involving in the Hattori-Stong integrability conditions. We also give an evenness condition for the signature of stably almost-complex manifolds in terms of Chern numbers. As an application, it can be showed that the signature of a $2n$-dimensional stably almost-complex manifold whose possibly nonzero Chern numbers being $c_n$ and $c_ic_{n-i}$ is even, which particularly rules out the existence of such structure on rational projective planes. Some other related results and remarks are also discussed in this article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi-homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus-one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi-homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus-one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements -- that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>
