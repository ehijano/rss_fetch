      <title>AsCL: An Asymmetry-sensitive Contrastive Learning Method for Image-Text Retrieval with Cross-Modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image-text retrieval task aims to retrieve relevant information from a given image or text. The main challenge is to unify multimodal representation and distinguish fine-grained differences across modalities, thereby finding similar contents and filtering irrelevant contents. However, existing methods mainly focus on unified semantic representation and concept alignment for multi-modalities, while the fine-grained differences across modalities have rarely been studied before, making it difficult to solve the information asymmetry problem. In this paper, we propose a novel asymmetry-sensitive contrastive learning method. By generating corresponding positive and negative samples for different asymmetry types, our method can simultaneously ensure fine-grained semantic differentiation and unified semantic representation between multi-modalities. Additionally, a hierarchical cross-modal fusion method is proposed, which integrates global and local-level features through a multimodal attention mechanism to achieve concept alignment. Extensive experiments performed on MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Distilling Implicit Multimodal Knowledge into LLMs for Zero-Resource Dialogue Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating multimodal knowledge into large language models (LLMs) represents a significant advancement in dialogue generation capabilities. However, the effective incorporation of such knowledge in zero-resource scenarios remains a substantial challenge due to the scarcity of diverse, high-quality dialogue datasets. To address this, we propose the Visual Implicit Knowledge Distillation Framework (VIKDF), an innovative approach aimed at enhancing LLMs for enriched dialogue generation in zero-resource contexts by leveraging implicit multimodal knowledge. VIKDF comprises two main stages: knowledge distillation, using an Implicit Query Transformer to extract and encode visual implicit knowledge from image-text pairs into knowledge vectors; and knowledge integration, employing a novel Bidirectional Variational Information Fusion technique to seamlessly integrate these distilled vectors into LLMs. This enables the LLMs to generate dialogues that are not only coherent and engaging but also exhibit a deep understanding of the context through implicit multimodal cues, effectively overcoming the limitations of zero-resource scenarios. Our extensive experimentation across two dialogue datasets shows that VIKDF outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in generating high-quality dialogues. The code will be publicly available following acceptance.</description>

      <title>MMFusion: Multi-modality Diffusion Model for Lymph Node Metastasis Diagnosis in Esophageal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Esophageal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and ranks sixth in cancer-related mortality. Accurate computer-assisted diagnosis of cancer progression can help physicians effectively customize personalized treatment plans. Currently, CT-based cancer diagnosis methods have received much attention for their comprehensive ability to examine patients' conditions. However, multi-modal based methods may likely introduce information redundancy, leading to underperformance. In addition, efficient and effective interactions between multi-modal representations need to be further explored, lacking insightful exploration of prognostic correlation in multi-modality features. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal heterogeneous graph-based conditional feature-guided diffusion model for lymph node metastasis diagnosis based on CT images as well as clinical measurements and radiomics data. To explore the intricate relationships between multi-modal features, we construct a heterogeneous graph. Following this, a conditional feature-guided diffusion approach is applied to eliminate information redundancy. Moreover, we propose a masked relational representation learning strategy, aiming to uncover the latent prognostic correlations and priorities of primary tumor and lymph node image representations. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/wuchengyu123/MMFusion.</description>
