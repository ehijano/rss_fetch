      <title>Emergence of higher-order interactions in systems of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that govern collective synchronization is a paramount task in nonlinear dynamics. While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Universe Learning Itself: On the Evolution of Dynamics from the Big Bang to Machine Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified, dynamical-systems narrative of the universe that traces a continuous chain of structure formation from the Big Bang to contemporary human societies and their artificial learning systems. Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.</description>

      <title>Time-Delayed Dynamics in Regular Kuramoto Networks with Inertia: Multistability, Traveling Waves, Chimera States, and Transitions to Seizure-Like Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the complex interplay between inertia and time delay in regular rotor networks within the framework of the second-order Kuramoto model. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate that intrinsic time delays -- arising from finite information transmission speeds - induce multistability among fully synchronized phase-locked states. Unlike systems without inertia, the presence of inertia destabilizes these phase-locked states, reduces their basin of attraction, and gives rise to nonlinear phase-locked dynamics over specific inertia ranges. In addition, we show that time delays promote the emergence of turbulent chimera states, while inertia enhances their spatial extent. Notably, the combined influence of inertia and time delay produces dynamic patterns reminiscent of partial epileptic seizures. These findings provide new insights into synchronization phenomena by revealing how inertia and time delay fundamentally reshape the stability and dynamics of regular rotor networks, with broader implications for neuronal modeling and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Explosive dispersal of non-motile microbes through metabolic buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-motile microorganisms, spatial expansion in quiescent fluids is presumed to be limited by diffusion. We report that microbial colonies can explosively circumvent this constraint through a self-amplifying physical process. As non-motile yeast and bacteria metabolize dense nutrients into lighter waste within their fluid environment, they generate buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, an ubiquitous fluid-dynamical phenomenon that organizes material on scales from chemical reactors to planetary atmospheres. This robust, self-generated flow fragments and disperses cellular aggregates, which seed new growth sites, enhancing total metabolic activity and further strengthening the convective flow in an autocatalytic cycle. The resulting expansion follows accelerating power-law kinetics, quantitatively captured by a physical theory linking metabolic flux to flow velocity, and produces fractal patterns through a flow-focusing instability we term Circulation-Driven Aggregation, the hydrodynamic analogue of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. This `metabolic fireworks' mechanism establishes a canonical instance of proliferating active matter, where cellular metabolic activity self-organizes a physical transport engine--a living Rayleigh-B\'enard convection--providing a fundamental, physics-based dispersal strategy.</description>

      <title>Self-Affine Scaling of Earth's Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's relief is approximately self-affine, meaning a zoom-in on a small region looks statistically similar to a large region upon a suitable rescaling. Fractional Brownian surfaces give an idealized self-affine model of Earth's relief with one parameter, the Hurst exponent $H$, characterizing the roughness of the surface. To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship. The estimated Hurst exponents differ greatly, indicating different fractal scaling behavior for different geometric features, but are sorted in order of increasing expected influence of erosion at the shorelines.</description>

      <title>The Motile Josephson Array: Bridging Active Turbulence and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support an emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for the emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically by a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and quantum superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller total effective resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. Moreover, HuPPI networks are consistently more robust under both random edge removals and curvature-based targeted edge removals, maintaining larger connected components for larger fractions of removed edges than their PoPPI counterparts. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns.</description>
