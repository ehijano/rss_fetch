      <title>Measurement of Light Yield Response of Gd-compatible Water-based Liquid Scintillator with the Brookhaven 1-ton testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) enables hybrid detection by combining scintillation and Cherenkov signals, providing superior event reconstruction capabilities compared to conventional neutrino detectors. We measured the light yield of Gd-compatible WbLS at varying concentrations from 0.35\% to 1\% by mass, using cosmic-ray muons in a 1-ton scale detector at BNL. The light yield is measured as (69.16 $\pm$ 6.92) ph / MeV at 0.35\% concentration, which increased to (87.32 $\pm$ 8.73) ph / MeV at 1\%. These results establish a quantitative basis for optimizing future WbLS-based detectors in neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of the long-term annealing behavior of neutron irradiated diodes from 8-inch p-type silicon wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The high-radiation regions of the the CE, where fluences between $1\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses of up to 2\,MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of $3\,ab^{-1}$, will be equipped with silicon pad sensors. This includes the entire electromagnetic as well as parts of the hadronic section of the CE. The silicon sensors are processed on 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300\,\textmu m, 200\,\textmu m and 120\,\textmu m and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the full wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor, several small test structures (e.g. pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at JSI (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) to fluences between $5\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1.5\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. This study focuses on the isothermal annealing behavior of the bulk material at different temperatures between 5.5{\deg}C and 60{\deg}C using electrical characterization and charge collection measurements. The results are used to extract the annealing time constants for this material and fluence range based on the Hamburg model approach to allow an estimation of the expected annealing effects in silicon sensors during the year-end technical stops and the long HL-LHC shutdowns. The annealing parameters found will make it possible to model the annealing behavior of p-type silicon detector projects at HL-LHC fluence ranges better than the existing Hamburg model.</description>

      <title>Operation of silicon photomultipliers in a dilution refrigerator down to 9.4 mK towards a cryogenic cosmic ray muon veto system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the characterisation of a FBK NUV-HD-cryo silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) sensor operated in an 9.4 $\pm$ 0.2 mK environment inside a dilution refrigerator, towards the development of a cryogenic cosmic ray muon veto system to be operated internal to a dilution refrigerator required for low background experiments such as the QUEST-DMC dark matter search experiment. We characterise the single photon response and the gain (the charge produced per detected photon), the dark count noise rate, and correlated noise contributions as a function of operating voltage. This paper also reports first proof of concept measurements of using a SiPM directly coupled to scintillator in a 9.4 mK temperature environment, towards detecting candidate cosmic ray muon signals.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a large-area double-sided silicon strip detector for quality assurance in ion-beam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designed to provide quality assurance for ion-beam radiotherapy, the prototype fIVI (filtered Interaction Vertex Imaging) Range Monitoring System is a two-layer tracker which employs double-sided strip-segmented silicon detectors. To meet the high demands of a clinical environment, a large sensitive area is required, along with a fast and compact readout. As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ significantly from radiotherapy, validation was necessary to ensure that these sensors would function effectively at the order 100 MeV/u energies and order MHz count rates expected during clinical irradiation. Tests were conducted using scattered subclinical 19 MeV protons at high intensity, and clinical 207 MeV/u carbon ions at low intensity to independently validate these variables. The detection system is found to operate at rates up to 1.3 MHz, with a negligible fraction of events being affected by pileup. The efficiency of hit reconstruction is high, with a timestamp resolution of 6.25 ns, and a coincidence window of 31.25 ns, as is required for clinical event rates. With these settings, over 90% of particle interactions are able to reconstruct unique hit positions and contribute to track formation. This device is the first system using large-area, high-resolution detectors which meets the demanding count rate requirements associated with clinical radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>A MAPS Detector for High Resolution Low Dose EBSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of highly sensitive pixelated direct detectors has dramatically improved the performance of high energy instrumentation such as transmission electron microscopy. Here, we describe a recently developed monolithic active pixel sensor designed for low energy scanning electron microscopy applications. This detector enables electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) at lower energies and dose than are accessible with existing scintillator-coupled detectors, expanding grain orientation mapping capabilities to materials such as ceramics that are poor electron conductors. The high detector sensitivity allows collection of rich diffraction information - providing dislocation defect contrast that is otherwise not accessible via EBSD. Indeed, even the energy of single electron interaction events can be measured with this detector, which we demonstrate to energy filter diffraction patterns revealing details of how diffraction occurs at low energy.</description>

      <title>Toward the Origins of Binding Energy Shifts and Satellites Formation During Plasma-XPS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In plasma X ray photoelectron spectroscopy emerges as a powerful platform for real time, in situ chemical analysis under conditions relevant to semiconductor processing and other plasma enabled technologies. This study investigates the origins of binding energy shifts and satellite peaks formation observed during plasma XPS measurements across conductive, dielectric, and gas phase systems. Using a standard laboratory based ambient pressure XPS apparatus coupled with an alternating current driven capacitively coupled plasma source, we show that metastable surface species, such as transient Au oxides, can be detected during plasma exposure, revealing chemical states hardly accessible using conventional ultrahigh vacuum XPS. In dielectric samples, we observe pressure- and plasma type dependent BE shifts up to 50 eV, attributed to X ray induced and plasma mediated surface charging. These shifts are mitigated at higher pressures plasmas or in electronegative plasmas, the latter due to enhanced charge compensation mechanisms involving slow negative ions. For gas phase species, AC plasma excitation leads to spectral broadening and the emergence of satellite peaks with a few eV energy separations, linked to oscillating local plasma potentials in the probing volume. These findings highlight the important and complex interplay of plasma parameters, surface charging, and local electric fields in shaping XPS spectra. Overall, plasma XPS emerges as a critical metrological tool for probing transient surface chemistry, with implications for semiconductor processing, material synthesis, and plasma diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Toward precision physics tests with future COHERENT detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive sensitivity study of future CE$\nu$NS detectors, focusing on a cryogenic cesium iodide detector and a tonne-scale liquid argon one, currently being developed by the COHERENT Collaboration. These setups will enable precision measurements of the weak mixing angle at low energies and allow accurate extraction of the neutron nuclear distribution radius. We also demonstrate that next-generation detectors will place constraints on the neutrino charge radius comparable to or better than current global fits. In addition, we explore the sensitivity to non standard neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as magnetic moments and millicharges, as well as new mediators. These findings reinforce the role of CE$\nu$NS experiments in the upcoming precision era, with future detectors playing a key role in advancing our understanding of neutrino interactions and electroweak physics at low energies.</description>

      <title>Intensified optical camera with Timepix4 readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.3 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.6 to 1.5 ns in the single-photon regime with an intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, and also in pixel count and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and timewalk effect, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera's temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>

      <title>Picosecond Precision Heavy Ion Detector for {\Lambda} Hypernuclei Lifetime Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and preliminary performance evaluation of a new heavy ion detector for direct measurements of heavy {\Lambda} hypernuclei lifetime. The detector employs the previously developed 10 picosecond resolution Radio Frequency (RF) Timer, which converts the temporal information of incident particles into spatial coordinates of secondary or photoelectrons on a position-sensitive detector by means of circular RF scanning in the 500-1000 MHz range. Here, we report the detector design to achieve efficient suppression of accidental background and effective separation of prompt reaction products and delayed events from {\Lambda} hypernuclei decays, results of test studies carried out with RF synchronized laser as well as preliminary results obtained by using alpha particles. Dedicated Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed to estimate the detector's performance under realistic experimental conditions at RF-driven electron, photon, or proton beams. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed design and provide a basis for upcoming experimental measurements, based on the delayed fission detection.</description>
