      <title>Complex Electromagnetic Space Combat System-of-systems Modeling and Key Node Identification Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the application of advanced science and technology in the military field, modern warfare has developed into a confrontation between systems. The combat system-of-systems (CSoS) has numerous nodes, multiple attributes and complex interactions, and its research and analysis are facing great difficulties. Electromagnetic space is an important dimension of modern warfare. Modeling and analyzing the CSoS from this perspective is of great significance to studying modern warfare and can provide a reference for the research of electromagnetic warfare. In this study, the types of nodes and relationships in the complex electromagnetic space of CSoS are first divided, the important attributes of the combat nodes are extracted, and the relationship weights are normalized to establish a networked model. On this basis, the calculation method of CSoS combat effectiveness based on the combat cycle is proposed, and then the identification and sorting of key nodes can be realized by the node deletion method. Finally, by constructing an instance of aircraft carrier fleet confrontation, the feasibility of this method has been verified, and the experimental results have been compared with classical algorithms to demonstrate the advanced nature of this method.</description>
