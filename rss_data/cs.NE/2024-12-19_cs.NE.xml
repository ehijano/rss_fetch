      <title>Combining Aggregated Attention and Transformer Architecture for Accurate and Efficient Performance of Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their distinctive low-power characteristics. Meanwhile, Transformer models, known for their powerful self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing capabilities, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Despite the significant advantages of both SNNs and Transformers, directly combining the low-power benefits of SNNs with the high performance of Transformers remains challenging. Specifically, while the sparse computing mode of SNNs contributes to reduced energy consumption, traditional attention mechanisms depend on dense matrix computations and complex softmax operations. This reliance poses significant challenges for effective execution in low-power scenarios. Given the tremendous success of Transformers in deep learning, it is a necessary step to explore the integration of SNNs and Transformers to harness the strengths of both. In this paper, we propose a novel model architecture, Spike Aggregation Transformer (SAFormer), that integrates the low-power characteristics of SNNs with the high-performance advantages of Transformer models. The core contribution of SAFormer lies in the design of the Spike Aggregated Self-Attention (SASA) mechanism, which significantly simplifies the computation process by calculating attention weights using only the spike matrices query and key, thereby effectively reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we introduce a Depthwise Convolution Module (DWC) to enhance the feature extraction capabilities, further improving overall accuracy. We evaluated and demonstrated that SAFormer outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs in both accuracy and energy consumption, highlighting its significant advantages in low-power and high-performance computing.</description>

      <title>Faster and Stronger: When ANN-SNN Conversion Meets Parallel Spiking Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired and energy-efficient network, is currently facing the pivotal challenge of exploring a suitable and efficient learning framework. The predominant training methodologies, namely Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) and ANN-SNN Conversion, are encumbered by substantial training overhead or pronounced inference latency, which impedes the advancement of SNNs in scaling to larger networks and navigating intricate application domains. In this work, we propose a novel parallel conversion learning framework, which establishes a mathematical mapping relationship between each time-step of the parallel spiking neurons and the cumulative spike firing rate. We theoretically validate the lossless and sorting properties of the conversion process, as well as pointing out the optimal shifting distance for each step. Furthermore, by integrating the above framework with the distribution-aware error calibration technique, we can achieve efficient conversion towards more general activation functions or training-free circumstance. Extensive experiments have confirmed the significant performance advantages of our method for various conversion cases under ultra-low time latency. To our best knowledge, this is the first work which jointly utilizes parallel spiking calculation and ANN-SNN Conversion, providing a highly promising approach for SNN supervised training.</description>

      <title>Cross-table Synthetic Tabular Data Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic tabular data is essential to prevent the distribution of false or manipulated datasets that could compromise data-driven decision-making. This study explores whether synthetic tabular data can be reliably identified ''in the wild''-meaning across different generators, domains, and table formats. This challenge is unique to tabular data, where structures (such as number of columns, data types, and formats) can vary widely from one table to another. We propose three cross-table baseline detectors and four distinct evaluation protocols, each corresponding to a different level of ''wildness''. Our very preliminary results confirm that cross-table adaptation is a challenging task.</description>

      <title>Cultivating Archipelago of Forests: Evolving Robust Decision Trees through Island Coevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in machine learning due to their simplicity and interpretability, but they often lack robustness to adversarial attacks and data perturbations. The paper proposes a novel island-based coevolutionary algorithm (ICoEvoRDF) for constructing robust decision tree ensembles. The algorithm operates on multiple islands, each containing populations of decision trees and adversarial perturbations. The populations on each island evolve independently, with periodic migration of top-performing decision trees between islands. This approach fosters diversity and enhances the exploration of the solution space, leading to more robust and accurate decision tree ensembles. ICoEvoRDF utilizes a popular game theory concept of mixed Nash equilibrium for ensemble weighting, which further leads to improvement in results. ICoEvoRDF is evaluated on 20 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in optimizing both adversarial accuracy and minimax regret. The flexibility of ICoEvoRDF allows for the integration of decision trees from various existing methods, providing a unified framework for combining diverse solutions. Our approach offers a promising direction for developing robust and interpretable machine learning models</description>

      <title>Training neural networks without backpropagation using particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are a group of neurons stacked together in multiple layers to mimic the biological neurons in a human brain. Neural networks have been trained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy for several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the backpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is optimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the manifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions matching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of local minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to select the best local minima among the search space of the loss function. The search space is limited to the instantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the best solution. In the proposed approach, we overcome the problem of gradient descent and the limitation of the PSO algorithm by training individual neurons separately, capable of collectively solving the problem as a group of neurons forming a network.
