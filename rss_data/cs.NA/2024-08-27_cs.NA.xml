      <title>On a nonlinear laplacian based filter for noise removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear filter for noise removal based on the Laplacian for 1D and 2D data. The method utilizes the solution to a fourth-order nonlinear PDE involving the Laplacian for data reconstruction. Evolution equations are introduced to solve this fourth-order nonlinear equation. Numerical experiments show that the new filter preserves discontinuities while filtering out noise. The restored data are piecewise linear and avoid the staircase effect commonly observed with total variation denoising methods.</description>

      <title>Iterative Refinement with Low-Precision Posits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13400v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates using a mixed-precision iterative refinement method using posit numbers instead of the standard IEEE floating-point format. The method is applied to solve a general linear system represented by the equation $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a large sparse matrix. Various scaling techniques, such as row and column equilibration, map the matrix entries to higher-density regions of machine numbers before performing the $O(n^3)$ factorization operation. Low-precision LU factorization followed by forward/backward substitution provides an initial estimate. The results demonstrate that a 16-bit posit configuration combined with equilibration produces accuracy comparable to IEEE half-precision (fp16), indicating a potential for achieving a balance between efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving parametric finite element method for curve diffusion based on Lagrange multiplier approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for parametric finite element methods to simulate surface diffusion of closed curves, which is also called as the curve diffusion. Several high-order temporal discretizations are proposed based on this new formulation. To ensure that the numerical methods preserve geometric structures of curve diffusion (i.e., the perimeter-decreasing and area-preserving properties), our formulation incorporates two scalar Lagrange multipliers and two evolution equations involving the perimeter and area, respectively. By discretizing the spatial variable using piecewise linear finite elements and the temporal variable using either the Crank-Nicolson method or the backward differentiation formulae method, we develop high-order temporal schemes that effectively preserve the structure at a fully discrete level. These new schemes are implicit and can be efficiently solved using Newton's method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve the desired temporal accuracy, as measured by the manifold distance, while simultaneously preserving the geometric structure of the curve diffusion.</description>

      <title>A node-conservative vorticity-preserving Finite Volume method for linear acoustics on unstructured grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instead of ensuring that fluxes across edges add up to zero, we split the edge in two halves and also associate different fluxes to each of its sides. This is possible due to non-standard Riemann solvers with free parameters. We then enforce conservation by making sure that the fluxes around a node sum up to zero, which fixes the value of the free parameter. We demonstrate that for linear acoustics one of the non-standard Riemann solvers leads to a vorticity preserving method on unstructured meshes.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error Estimates of Machine Learning Methods for Solving High Dimensional Schr\"odinger Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning method for computing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operator on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The cut-off function technique is employed to construct trial functions that precisely satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions. This approach eliminates the error caused by the standard boundary penalty method, improves the overall accuracy of the method, as demonstrated by the typical numerical examples. Under the assumption that the eigenfunctions belong to a spectral Barron space, we derive an explicit convergence rate of the generalization error of the proposed method, which does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We verify the assumption by proving a new regularity shift result for the eigenfunctions when the potential function belongs to an appropriate spectral Barron space. Moreover, we extend the generalization error bound to the normalized penalty method, which is widely used in practice.</description>

      <title>Frontal Slice Approaches for Tensor Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the row and column action methods for solving large-scale linear systems, in this work, we explore the use of frontal slices for solving tensor linear systems. In particular, this paper presents a novel approach for using frontal slices of a tensor $\mathcal{A}$ to solve tensor linear systems $\mathcal{A} * \mathcal{X} = \mathcal{B}$ where $*$ denotes the t-product. In addition, we consider variations of this method, including cyclic, block, and randomized approaches, each designed to optimize performance in different operational contexts. Our primary contribution lies in the development and convergence analysis of these methods. Experimental results on synthetically generated and real-world data, including applications such as image and video deblurring, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approaches and validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Decoupling technology for systems of evolutionary equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods of approximate solution of the Cauchy problem for coupled systems of evolution equations are considered. Separating simpler subproblems for individual components of the solution achieves simplification of the problem at a new level in time. The decoupling method, a significant approach to simplifying the problem, is based on the decomposition of the problem's operator matrix. The approximate solution is constructed based on the linear composition of solutions to auxiliary problems. The paper investigates decoupling variants based on extracting the diagonal part of the operator matrix and the lower and upper triangular submatrices. The study introduces a new decomposition approach, which involves splitting the operator matrix into rows and columns. The composition stage utilizes various variants of splitting schemes, showcasing the versatility of the approach. In additive operator-difference schemes, we can distinguish explicit-implicit schemes, factorized schemes for two-component splitting, and regularized schemes for general multicomponent splitting. The study of stability of two- and three-level decoupling composition schemes is carried out using the theory of stability (correctness) of operator-difference schemes for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The theoretical results of the decoupling technique for systems of evolution equations are illustrated on a test two-dimensional problem for a coupled system of two diffusion equations with inhomogeneous self- and cross-diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Full- and low-rank exponential Euler integrators for the Lindblad equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation is a widely used quantum master equation to model the dynamical evolution of open quantum systems whose states are described by density matrices. These solution matrices are characterized by semi-positiveness and trace preserving properties, which must be guaranteed in any physically meaningful numerical simulation. In this paper, novel full- and low-rank exponential Euler integrators are developed for approximating the Lindblad equation that preserve positivity and trace unconditionally. Theoretical results are presented that provide sharp error estimates for the two classes of exponential integration methods. Results of numerical experiments are discussed that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, beyond present state-of-the-art capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Generalized-Order Constitutive Modeling of Viscoelastic Spectra of Polyurea-Graphene Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyurea (PUa) elastomers are extensively used in a wide range of applications spanning from biomedical to defense fields due to their enabling mechanical properties. These materials can be further reinforced through the incorporation of nanoparticles to form nanocomposites. This study focuses on an IPDI-based PUa matrix with exfoliated graphene nanoplatelet (xGnP) fillers. We propose a generalized constitutive model by integrating one Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) and one Fractional Maxwell Gel (FMG) branch in a parallel configuration via introducing a new dimensionless number to bridge between these branches physically and mathematically. Through systematic local-to-global sensitivity analyses, we investigate the behavior of these nanocomposites to facilitate simulation, design, and performance prediction. Consistently, the constructed models share the same most/least influential model parameters. $\alpha_1$ and $E_{c_1}$, the power exponent and the characteristic modulus of the first branch, are found to be the most influential model parameters, while $\tau_{c_2}$ and $\tau_{c_1}$, the characteristic time-scales of each branch, are recognized as the least influential model parameters. The proposed PU nanocomposite constitutive laws can now make an impact to the design and optimization of coating and shock-absorbing coatings in a range of applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Regularization for 3D Multi-Species Tumor Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-species partial differential equation (PDE) model for tumor growth and a an algorithm for calibrating the model from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The model is designed for glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors. The modeled species correspond to proliferative, infiltrative, and necrotic tumor cells. The model calibration is formulated as an inverse problem and solved a PDE-constrained optimization method. The data that drives the calibration is derived by a single multi-parametric MRI image. This a typical clinical scenario for GBMs. The unknown parameters that need to be calibrated from data include ten scalar parameters and the infinite dimensional initial condition (IC) for proliferative tumor cells. This inverse problem is highly ill-posed as we try to calibrate a nonlinear dynamical system from data taken at a single time. To address this ill-posedness, we split the inversion into two stages. First we regularize the IC reconstruction by solving a single-species compressed sensing problem. Then, using the IC reconstruction, we invert for model parameters using a weighted regularization term. We construct the regularization term by using auxiliary 1D inverse problems. We apply our proposed scheme to clinical data. We compare our algorithm with single-species reconstruction and unregularized reconstructions. Our scheme enables the stable estimation of non-observable species and quantification of infiltrative tumor cells.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for abstract Cauchy problem with nonlinear nonlocal condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem for the first order differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient in Banach space and nonlinear nonlocal condition is considered. A numerical method is proposed and justified for the solution of this problem under assumptions that the mentioned operator coefficient $A$ is strongly positive and some existence and uniqueness conditions are fulfilled. The method is based on the reduction of the given problem to an abstract Hammerstein equation. The later one is discretized by collocation and then solved via the fixed-point iteration method. Each iteration of the method involves Sinc-based numerical evaluation of the operator exponential represented by a Dunford-Cauchy integral along hyperbola enveloping the spectrum of $A$.</description>

      <title>Structured Backward Error Analysis with Preserving Sparsity for Three-by-Three Block Saddle Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backward error (\textit{BE}) analysis emerges as a powerful tool for assessing the backward stability and strong backward stability of iterative algorithms. In this paper, we explore structured \textit{BEs} for a class of three-by-three block saddle point problems (\textit{TBSPPs}), aiming to assess the strong backward stability of iterative algorithms devised to find their solution. Our investigations preserve the inherent matrix structure and sparsity pattern in the corresponding perturbation matrices and derive explicit formulae for the structure \textit{BEs}. Moreover, we provide formulae for the structure-preserving minimal perturbation matrices for which the structured \textit{BE} is attained. Furthermore, using the obtained structured \textit{BEs}, we propose three new termination criteria for the iterative algorithms to solve the \textit{TBSPP.} Numerical experiments are performed to test the strong backward stability of various iterative algorithms, as well as the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed termination criteria.</description>

      <title>Revisiting time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations with their corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations, neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale linear equations and high dimension have been hot topics in deep learning, machine learning, control,and scientific computing. Because of special conjugate operation characteristics, time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations need to be transformed into corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations. In this paper, zeroing neural dynamic models based on complex field error (called Con-CZND1) and based on real field error (called Con-CZND2) are proposed for in-depth analysis. Con-CZND1 has fewer elements because of the direct processing of complex matrices. Con-CZND2 needs to be transformed into the real field, with more elements, and its performance is affected by the main diagonal dominance of coefficient matrices. A neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach (NHNSCAA) is innovatively proposed. Then Con-CZND1 conj model is constructed. Numerical experiments verify Con-CZND1 conj model effectiveness and highlight NHNSCAA importance.</description>

Along the way we also approximate the sign function relative to $E$ and $F$ (the fourth Zolotarev problem).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that spatially semi-discrete evolving finite element method for parabolic equations on a given evolving hypersurface of arbitrary dimensions preserves the maximal $L^p$-regularity at the discrete level. We first establish the results on a stationary surface and then extend them, via a perturbation argument, to the case where the underlying surface is evolving under a prescribed velocity field. The proof combines techniques in evolving finite element method, properties of Green's functions on (discretised) closed surfaces, and local energy estimates for finite element methods</description>

      <title>Recursive sparse LU decomposition based on nested dissection and low rank approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using finite difference or finite element methods, efficient solvers are required for handling large sparse linear systems. In this paper, a recursive sparse LU decomposition for matrices arising from the discretization of linear PDEs is proposed based on the nested dissection and low rank approximations. The matrix is reorganized based on the nested structure of the associated graph. After eliminating the interior vertices at the finest level, dense blocks on the separators are hierarchically sparsified using low rank approximations. To efficiently skeletonize these dense blocks, we split the separators into segments and introduce a hybrid algorithm to extract the low rank structures based on a randomized algorithm and the fast multipole method. The resulting decomposition yields a fast direct solver for sparse matrices, applicable to both symmetric and non-symmetric cases. Under a mild assumption on the compression rate of dense blocks, we prove an $\O(N)$ complexity for the fast direct solver. Several numerical experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A generalized skew-symmetric Lanczos bidiagonalization method for computing several extreme eigenpairs of a large skew-symmetric/symmetric positive definite matrix pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized skew-symmetric Lanczos bidiagonalization (GSSLBD) method is proposed to compute several extreme eigenpairs of a large matrix pair $(A,B)$, where $A$ is skew-symmetric and $B$ is symmetric positive definite. The underlying GSSLBD process produces two sets of $B$-orthonormal generalized Lanczos basis vectors that are also $B$-biorthogonal and a series of bidiagonal matrices whose singular values are taken as the approximations to the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of $(A,B)$ and the corresponding left and right singular vectors premultiplied with the left and right generalized Lanczos basis matrices form the real and imaginary parts of the associated approximate eigenvectors. A rigorous convergence analysis is made on the desired eigenspaces approaching the Krylov subspaces generated by the GSSLBD process and accuracy estimates are made for the approximate eigenpairs. In finite precision arithmetic, it is shown that the semi-$B$-orthogonality and semi-$B$-biorthogonality of the computed left and right generalized Lanczos vectors suffice to compute the eigenvalues accurately. An efficient partial reorthogonalization strategy is adapted to GSSLBD in order to maintain the desired semi-$B$-orthogonality and semi-$B$-biorthogonality. To be practical, an implicitly restarted GSSLBD algorithm, abbreviated as IRGSSLBD, is developed with partial $B$-reorthogonalizations. Numerical experiments illustrate the robustness and overall efficiency of the IRGSSLBD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spherical configurations and quadrature methods for integral equations of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a product integration method for the second-kind integral equation with weakly singular and continuous kernels on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. We employ quadrature rules that satisfy the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund property to construct hyperinterpolation for approximating the product of the continuous kernel and the solution, in terms of spherical harmonics. By leveraging this property, we significantly expand the family of candidate quadrature rules and establish a connection between the geometrical information of the quadrature points and the error analysis of the method. We then utilize product integral rules to evaluate the singular integral with the integrand being the product of the singular kernel and each spherical harmonic. We derive a practical $L^{\infty}$ error bound, which consists of two terms: one controlled by the best approximation of the product of the continuous kernel and the solution, and the other characterized by the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund property and the best approximation polynomial of this product. Numerical examples validate our numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Consistent machine learning for topology optimization with microstructure-dependent neural network material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13843v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing methods together with topology optimization have enabled the creation of multiscale structures with controlled spatially-varying material microstructure. However, topology optimization or inverse design of such structures in the presence of nonlinearities remains a challenge due to the expense of computational homogenization methods and the complexity of differentiably parameterizing the microstructural response. A solution to this challenge lies in machine learning techniques that offer efficient, differentiable mappings between the material response and its microstructural descriptors. This work presents a framework for designing multiscale heterogeneous structures with spatially varying microstructures by merging a homogenization-based topology optimization strategy with a consistent machine learning approach grounded in hyperelasticity theory. We leverage neural architectures that adhere to critical physical principles such as polyconvexity, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency to supply the framework with a reliable constitutive model that is dependent on material microstructural descriptors. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating consistent machine learning models with density-based topology optimization for enhancing design optimization of heterogeneous hyperelastic structures under finite deformations.</description>

      <title>Variable offsets and processing of implicit forms toward the adaptive synthesis and analysis of heterogeneous conforming microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of porous, lattice, or microstructure geometries has captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. Implicit forms, such as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) has captured a significant attention, recently, as tiles in lattices, partially because implicit forms have the potential for synthesizing with ease more complex topologies of tiles, compared to parametric forms. In this work, we show how variable offsets of implicit forms could be used in lattice design as well as lattice analysis, while graded wall and edge thicknesses could be fully controlled in the lattice and even vary within a single tile. As a result, (geometrically) heterogeneous lattices could be created and adapted to follow analysis results while maintaining continuity between adjacent tiles. We demonstrate this ability on several 3D models, including TPMS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between port-Hamiltonian and positive real descriptor systems is investigated. It is well-known that port-Hamiltonian systems are positive real, but the converse implication does not always hold. In [K. Cherifi, H. Gernandt, and D. Hinsen. The difference between port-Hamiltonian, passive and positive real descriptor systems. Math. Control Signals Systems, pages 1-32, 2023] sufficient conditions for the converse are presented. We refine these conditions and present for a completely controllable, completely observable and positive real descriptor system a necessary and sufficient condition as well as an explicit method to compute a port-Hamiltonian realization of a general positive real descriptor system.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Reduced Circuit Depths Using Trotter Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product formulae are a popular class of digital quantum simulation algorithms due to their conceptual simplicity, low overhead, and performance which often exceeds theoretical expectations. Recently, Richardson extrapolation and polynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error incurred by use of these formulae. This work provides an improved, rigorous analysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved expectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error $\epsilon$ in a simulation of time $T$ using a $p^\text{th}$-order product formula with extrapolation, circuits depths of $O\left(T^{1+1/p} \textrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)\right)$ are sufficient -- an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we achieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with $T$, and do not require fractional implementations of Trotter steps. Our results provide a more accurate characterisation of the algorithmic error mitigation techniques currently proposed to reduce Trotter error.</description>

      <title>A Derivative-Free Martingale Neural Network Soc-Martnet For The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations In Stochastic Optimal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14395v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient derivative-free version of a martingale neural network SOC-MartNet proposed in Cai et al. [2] for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs) with controls on both drift and volatility. The solution of the HJB equation consists of two steps: (1) finding the optimal control from the value function, and (2) deriving the value function from a linear PDE characterized by the optimal control. The linear PDE is reformulated into a weak form of a new martingale formulation from the original SOC-MartNet where all temporal and spatial derivatives are replaced by an univariate, first-order random finite difference operator approximation, giving the derivative free version of the SOC-MartNet. Then, the optimal feedback control is identified by minimizing the mean of the value function, thereby avoiding the need for pointwise minimization on the Hamiltonian. Finally, the optimal control and value function are approximated by neural networks trained via adversarial learning using the derivative-free formulation. This method eliminates the reliance on automatic differentiation for computing temporal and spatial derivatives, offering significant efficiency in solving high-dimensional HJB equations and SOCPs.</description>

      <title>Model Parallel Training and Transfer Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks by Domain Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be very successful in a wide range of image processing applications. However, due to their increasing number of model parameters and an increasing availability of large amounts of training data, parallelization strategies to efficiently train complex CNNs are necessary. In previous work by the authors, a novel model parallel CNN architecture was proposed which is loosely inspired by domain decomposition. In particular, the novel network architecture is based on a decomposition of the input data into smaller subimages. For each of these subimages, local CNNs with a proportionally smaller number of parameters are trained in parallel and the resulting local classifications are then aggregated in a second step by a dense feedforward neural network (DNN). In the present work, we compare the resulting CNN-DNN architecture to less costly alternatives to combine the local classifications into a final, global decision. Additionally, we investigate the performance of the CNN-DNN trained as one coherent model as well as using a transfer learning strategy, where the parameters of the pre-trained local CNNs are used as initial values for a subsequently trained global coherent CNN-DNN model.</description>

Abstract: Critical points of an invariant function may or may not be symmetric. We prove, however, that if a symmetric critical point exists, those adjacent to it are generically symmetry breaking. This mathematical mechanism is shown to carry important implications for our ability to efficiently minimize invariant nonconvex functions, in particular those associated with neural networks.</description>

      <title>The limitations of a standard phase-field model in reproducing jointing in sedimentary rock layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geological applications of phase-field methods for fracture are notably scarce. This work conducts a numerical examination of the applicability of standard phase-field models in reproducing jointing within sedimentary layers. We explore how the volumetric-deviatoric split alongside the AT1 and AT2 phase-field formulations have several advantages in simulating jointing, but also have intrinsic limitations that prevent a reliable quantitative analysis of rock fracture. The formulations qualitatively reproduce the process of joint saturation, along with the negative correlation between joint spacing and the height of the sedimentary layer. However, in quantitative comparison to alternative numerical methods and outcrop observations, the phase-field method overestimates joint spacings by a factor of 2 and induces unrealistic compressive fractures in the AT1 model, alongside premature shearing at layer interfaces for the AT2 model. The causes are identified to be intrinsic to the phase-field lengthscale and the unsuitable strength envelope arising from the Volumetric-Deviatoric split. Finally, our analysis elucidates on the phase-field lengthscale's distortion of the stress field around dilating fractures, causing the sedimentary layer to reach joint saturation prematurely, thereby stopping the nucleation of new fractures and leading to larger joint spacings than in natural examples. Decreasing the lengthscale results in gradual improvement but becomes prohibitively computationally expensive for very small lengthscales such that the limit of ``natural'' behavior was not reached in this study. Overall, our results motivate the development of constitutive phase-field models that are more suitable for geological applications and their benchmarking against geological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive stability estimates for three commonly used radial basis function (RBF) methods to solve hyperbolic time-dependent PDEs: the RBF generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method, the RBF partition of unity method (RBF-PUM) and Kansa's (global) RBF method. We give the estimates in the discrete $\ell_2$-norm intrinsic to each of the three methods. The results show that Kansa's method and RBF-PUM can be $\ell_2$-stable in time under a sufficiently large oversampling of the discretized system of equations. The RBF-FD method in addition requires stabilization of the spurious jump terms due to the discontinuous RBF-FD cardinal basis functions. Numerical experiments show an agreement with our theoretical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the stochastic asymptotical regularization (SAR) has been developed in (\emph{Inverse Problems}, 39: 015007, 2023) for the uncertainty quantification of the stable approximate solution of linear ill-posed inverse problems. In this paper, we extend the regularization theory of SAR for nonlinear inverse problems. By combining techniques from classical regularization theory and stochastic analysis, we prove the regularizing properties of SAR with regard to mean-square convergence. The convergence rate results under the canonical sourcewise condition are also studied. Several numerical examples are used to show the accuracy and advantages of SAR: compared with the conventional deterministic regularization approaches for deterministic inverse problems, SAR can quantify the uncertainty in error estimates for ill-posed problems, improve accuracy by selecting the optimal path, escape local minima for nonlinear problems, and identify multiple solutions by clustering samples of obtained approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>Stabilized Weighted Reduced Order Methods for Parametrized Advection-Dominated Optimal Control Problems governed by Partial Differential Equations with Random Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze Parametrized Advection-Dominated distributed Optimal Control Problems with random inputs in a Reduced Order Model (ROM) context. All the simulations are initially based on a finite element method (FEM) discretization; moreover, a space-time approach is considered when dealing with unsteady cases. To overcome numerical instabilities that can occur in the optimality system for high values of the P\'eclet number, we consider a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin technique applied in an optimize-then-discretize approach. We combine this method with the ROM framework in order to consider two possibilities of stabilization: Offline-Only stabilization and Offline-Online stabilization. Moreover we consider random parameters and we use a weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition algorithm in a partitioned approach to deal with the issue of uncertainty quantification. Several quadrature techniques are used to derive weighted ROMs: tensor rules, isotropic sparse grids, Monte-Carlo and quasi Monte-Carlo methods. We compare all the approaches analyzing relative errors between the FEM and ROM solutions and the computational efficiency based on the speedup-index.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following hypothesis was put forward by Goreinov, Tyrtyshnikov and Zamarashkin in \cite{GTZ1997}. For arbitrary real $n \times k$ matrix with orthonormal columns a sufficiently "good" $k \times k$ submatrix exists. "Good" in the sense of having a bounded spectral norm of its inverse. The hypothesis says that for arbitrary $k = 1, \ldots, n-1$ the upper bound can be set at $\sqrt{n}$. Supported by numerical experiments, the problem remained open for all non-trivial cases ($1 &lt; k &lt; n-1$). In this paper we will give the proof for the simplest of them ($n = 4, \, k = 2$).</description>

      <title>Exponentially Convergent Numerical Method for Abstract Cauchy Problem with Fractional Derivative of Caputo Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exponentially convergent numerical method to approximate the solution of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous fractional differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient and Caputo fractional derivative in time. The numerical method is based on the newly obtained solution formula that consolidates the mild solution representations of sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and non-zero initial data. The involved integral operators are approximated using the sinc-quadrature formulas that are tailored to the spectral parameters of $A$, fractional order $\alpha$ and the smoothness of the first initial condition, as well as to the properties of the equation's right-hand side $f(t)$. The resulting method possesses exponential convergence for positive sectorial $A$, any finite $t$, including $t = 0$ and the whole range $\alpha \in (0,2)$. It is suitable for a practically important case, when no knowledge of $f(t)$ is available outside the considered interval $t \in [0, T]$. The algorithm of the method is capable of multi-level parallelism. We provide numerical examples that confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of adding geometrically smoothed momentum to the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm, which is an instance of stochastic gradient descent on a linear least squares loss function. We prove a result about the expected error in the direction of singular vectors of the matrix defining the least squares loss.

      <title>Optimally truncated WKB approximation for the 1D stationary Schr\"odinger equation in the highly oscillatory regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the efficient numerical computation of solutions to the 1D stationary Schr\"odinger equation in the highly oscillatory regime. We compute an approximate solution based on the well-known WKB-ansatz, which relies on an asymptotic expansion w.r.t. the small parameter $\varepsilon$. Assuming that the coefficient in the equation is analytic, we derive an explicit error estimate for the truncated WKB series, in terms of $\varepsilon$ and the truncation order $N$. For any fixed $\varepsilon$, this allows to determine the optimal truncation order $N_{opt}$ which turns out to be proportional to $\varepsilon^{-1}$. When chosen this way, the resulting error of the optimally truncated WKB series behaves like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(-r/\varepsilon))$, with some parameter $r&gt;0$. The theoretical results established in this paper are confirmed by several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Geometric Multigrid Preconditioning Of Combined Newton-GMRES For Solving Phase-Field Fracture With Local Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the matrix-free solution of quasi-static phase-field fracture problems is further investigated. More specifically, we consider a quasi-monolithic formulation in which the irreversibility constraint is imposed with a primal-dual active set method. The resulting nonlinear problem is solved with a line-search assisted Newton method. Therein, the arising linear equation systems are solved with a generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), which is preconditioned with a matrix-free geometric multigrid method including geometric local mesh refinement. Our solver is substantiated with a numerical test on locally refined meshes.</description>

      <title>Computation of tensors generalized inverses under $M$-product and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces notions of the Drazin and the core-EP inverses on tensors via M-product. We propose a few properties of the Drazin and core-EP inverses of tensors, as well as effective tensor-based algorithms for calculating these inverses. In addition, definitions of composite generalized inverses are presented in the framework of the M-product, including CMP, DMP, and MPD inverse of tensors. Tensor-based higher-order Gauss-Seidel and Gauss-Jacobi iterative methods are designed. Algorithms for these two iterative methods to solve multilinear equations are developed. Certain multilinear systems are solved using the Drazin inverse, core-EP inverses, and composite generalized inverses such as CMP, DMP, and MPD inverse. A tensor M-product-based regularization technique is applied to solve the color image deblurring.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimation for an interior penalty virtual element method of Kirchhoff plates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A residual-type a posteriori error estimation is developed for an interior penalty virtual element method (IPVEM) to solve a Kirchhoff plate bending problem with inhomogeneous boundary value conditions. The computable error estimator is incorporated. We derive the reliability and efficiency of the a posteriori error bound by constructing an enriching operator and establishing some related error estimates that align with interior penalty finite element methods. As an outcome of the error estimator, an adaptive VEM is introduced by means of the mesh refinement strategy with the one-hanging-node rule. Numerical results on several benchmark tests confirm the robustness of the proposed error estimator and show the efficiency of the resulting adaptive VEM.</description>

      <title>Adaptive planning for risk-aware predictive digital twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a mathematical framework to increase the robustness to rare events of digital twins modelled with graphical models. We incorporate probabilistic model-checking and linear programming into a dynamic Bayesian network to enable the construction of risk-averse digital twins. By modeling with a random variable the probability of the asset to transition from one state to another, we define a parametric Markov decision process. By solving this Markov decision process, we compute a policy that defines state-dependent optimal actions to take. To account for rare events connected to failures we leverage risk measures associated with the distribution of the random variables describing the transition probabilities. We refine the optimal policy at every time step resulting in a better trade off between operational costs and performances. We showcase the capabilities of the proposed framework with a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle and its adaptive mission replanning.</description>

      <title>Nonreflecting Boundary Condition for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation for hyperrectangular computational domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the efficient ways of implementing the transparent boundary condition (TBC) and its various approximations for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a hyperrectangular computational domain in $\field{R}^d$ with periodic boundary conditions along the $(d-1)$ unbounded directions. In particular, we consider Pad\'e approximant based rational approximation of the exact TBC and a spatially local form of the exact TBC obtained under its high-frequency approximation. For the spatial discretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method with a boundary-adapted basis to ensure the bandedness of the resulting linear system. Temporal discretization is then addressed with two one-step methods, namely, the backward-differentiation formula of order 1 (BDF1) and the trapezoidal rule (TR). Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods where we study the stability and convergence behaviour empirically.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a L2 regularized Policy Gradient Algorithm for the Multi Armed Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) on one hand and the policy gradient approach on the other hand are among the most used frameworks of Reinforcement Learning, the theoretical properties of the policy gradient algorithm used for MAB have not been given enough attention. We investigate in this work the convergence of such a procedure for the situation when a $L2$ regularization term is present jointly with the 'softmax' parametrization. We prove convergence under appropriate technical hypotheses and test numerically the procedure including situations beyond the theoretical setting. The tests show that a time dependent regularized procedure can improve over the canonical approach especially when the initial guess is far from the solution.</description>

      <title>Optimal time sampling in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) is a extremely powerful paradigm used to solve equations encountered in scientific computing applications. An important part of the procedure is the minimization of the equation residual which includes, when the equation is time-dependent, a time sampling. It was argued in the literature that the sampling need not be uniform but should overweight initial time instants, but no rigorous explanation was provided for this choice. In the present work we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a (truncated) exponential distribution. In particular we explain when is best to use uniform time sampling and when one should not. The findings are illustrated with numerical examples on linear equation, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz system.</description>

      <title>Automatic Differentiation is Essential in Training Neural Networks for Solving Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based approaches have recently shown significant promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering, especially in scenarios featuring complex domains or the incorporation of empirical data. One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.</description>
