      <title>Modular Biframes for Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important problems in the studying of frames and its extensions is the invariance of these systems under perturbation. The current paper is concerned with the invariance of Modular biframes for operators under some class of closed range operators.</description>

      <title>Multiple operator integrals, pseudodifferential calculus, and asymptotic expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We push the definition of multiple operator integrals (MOIs) into the realm of unbounded operators, using the pseudodifferential calculus from the works of Connes and Moscovici, Higson, and Guillemin. This in particular provides a natural language for operator integrals in noncommutative geometry. For this purpose, we develop a functional calculus for these pseudodifferential operators. To illustrate the power of this framework, we provide a pertubative expansion of the spectral action for regular $s$-summable spectral triples $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D)$, and an asymptotic expansion of $\mathrm{Tr}(P e^{-t(D+V)^2})$ as $t \downarrow 0$, where $P$ and $V$ belong to the algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and $D$, and $V$ is bounded and self-adjoint.</description>

      <title>Ascent and Descent of Weighted Composition Operators on Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to detect the ascent and descent of weighted composition operators on Lorentz spaces. We investigate the conditions on the measurable transformation $T$ and the complex-valued measurable function $u$ defined on measure space $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ that cause the weighted composition operators on Lorentz space $L(p, q)$, $1 &lt; p \leq \infty, 1 \leq q \leq \infty$ to have finite or infinite ascent (descent). We also give a number of examples in support of our findings.</description>

      <title>Operator realizations of non-commutative analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A realization or linearization is a triple, $(A,b,c)$, consisting of a $d-$tuple, $A= (A _1, \cdots, A_d )$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of bounded linear operators on a separable, complex Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}$, and vectors $b,c \in \mathcal{H}$. Any such realization defines a (uniformly) analytic non-commutative (NC) function in an open neighbourhood of the origin, $0:= (0, \cdots , 0)$, of the NC universe of $d-$tuples of square matrices of any fixed size via the formula $h(X) = I \otimes b^* ( I \otimes I _{\mathcal{H}} - \sum X_j \otimes A_j ) ^{-1} I \otimes c$.
  It is well-known that an NC function has a finite-dimensional realization if and only if it is a non-commutative rational function that is defined at $0$. Such finite realizations contain valuable information about the NC rational functions they generate. By considering more general, infinite-dimensional realizations we study, construct and characterize more general classes of uniformly analytic NC functions. In particular, we show that an NC function, $h$, is (uniformly) entire, if and only if it has a jointly compact and quasinilpotent realization. Restricting our results to one variable shows that an analytic Taylor-MacLaurin series extends globally to an entire or meromorphic function if and only if it has a realization whose component operator is compact and quasinilpotent, or compact, respectively. This then motivates our definition of the set of global uniformly meromorphic NC functions as the (universal) skew field (of fractions) generated by NC rational expressions in the (semi-free ideal) ring of NC functions with jointly compact realizations.</description>

      <title>A self-improving property of Riesz potentials in BMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that for non-negative measurable functions $f$,
  \begin{align*} I_\alpha f \in BMO(\mathbb{R}^n) \text{ if and only if } I_\alpha f \in BMO^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n) \text{ for } \beta \in (n-\alpha,n].
  \end{align*} Here $I_\alpha$ denotes the Riesz potential of order $\alpha$ and $BMO^\beta$ represents the space of functions of bounded $\beta$-dimensional mean oscillation.</description>

      <title>Sign Changing Critical Points for Locally Lipschitz Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, some existence results for sign-changing critical points of locally Lipschitz functionals in real Banach space are obtained by the method combining the invariant sets of descending ow method with a quantitative deformation. First we assume the locally Lipschitz functionals to be outwardly directed on the the boundary of some closed convex sets of the real Banach space. By using the relation between the critical points on the Banach space and those of the closed convex sets, we construct a quantitative deformation lemma, and then we obtain some linking type of critical points theorems. These theoretical results can be applied to the study of the existence of sign-changing solutions for differential inclusion problems. In contrast with the related results in the literatures, the main results of this paper relax the requirement that the functional being of C1 continuous to locally Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic spectrum distance, graph limits, and the Shannon capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the Shannon capacity of graphs is a long-standing open problem in information theory, graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Over decades, a wide range of upper and lower bound methods have been developed to analyze this problem. However, despite tremendous effort, even small instances of the problem have remained open.
  In recent years, a new dual characterization of the Shannon capacity of graphs, asymptotic spectrum duality, has unified and extended known upper bound methods and structural theorems. In this paper, building on asymptotic spectrum duality, we develop a new theory of graph distance, that we call asymptotic spectrum distance, and corresponding limits (reminiscent of, but different from, the celebrated theory of cut-norm, graphons and flag algebras). We propose a graph limit approach to the Shannon capacity problem: to determine the Shannon capacity of a graph, construct a sequence of easier to analyse graphs converging to it.
  (1) We give a very general construction of non-trivial converging sequences of graphs (in a family of circulant graphs).
  (2) We construct Cauchy sequences of finite graphs that do not converge to any finite graph, but do converge to an infinite graph. We establish strong connections between convergence questions of finite graphs and the asymptotic properties of Borsuk-like infinite graphs on the circle.
  (3) We observe that all best-known lower bound constructions for Shannon capacity of small odd cycles can be obtained from a "finite" version of the graph limit approach. We develop computational and theoretical aspects of this approach and use these to obtain a new Shannon capacity lower bound for the fifteen-cycle.
  The theory of asymptotic spectrum distance applies not only to Shannon capacity of graphs; indeed, we will develop it for a general class of mathematical objects and their asymptotic properties.</description>
