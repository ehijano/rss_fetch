      <title>The operationally ready full three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) model from the Sun to Earth: COCONUT+Icarus</title>

Abstract: Solar wind modelling has become a crucial area of study due to the increased dependence of modern society on technology, navigation, and power systems. Accurate space weather forecasts can predict upcoming threats to Earth's geospace. In this study, we examine a novel full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) chain from the Sun to Earth. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the capabilities of the full MHD modelling chain from the Sun to Earth by finalising the implementation of the full MHD coronal model into the COolfluid COroNa UnsTructured (COCONUT) model and coupling it to the MHD heliospheric model Icarus. The resulting coronal model has significant advantages compared to the pre-existing polytropic alternative, as it models a more realistic bi-modal wind, which is crucial for heliospheric studies.
  In this study, only thermal conduction, radiative losses, and approximated coronal heating function were considered in the energy equation. A realistic specific heat ratio was applied. The output of the coronal model was used to onset the 3D MHD heliospheric model Icarus. A minimum solar activity case was chosen as the first test case for the full MHD model. The numerically simulated data in the corona and the heliosphere were compared to observational products. We present a first attempt to obtain the full MHD chain from the Sun to Earth with COCONUT and Icarus. The coronal model has been upgraded to a full MHD model for a realistic bi-modal solar wind configuration. The approximated heating functions have modelled the wind reasonably well, but simple approximations are not enough to obtain a realistic density-speed balance or realistic features in the low corona and farther, near the outer boundary. The full MHD model was computed in 1.06 h on 180 cores of the Genius cluster of the Vlaams Supercomputing Center, which is only 1.8 times longer than the polytropic simulation.</description>

      <title>Reduction of the downward energy flux of non-thermal electrons in the solar flare corona due to co-spatial return current losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17955</link>

Abstract: High energy electrons carry much of a solar flare's energy. Therefore, understanding changes in electron beam distributions during their propagation is crucial. A key focus of this paper is how the co-spatial return current reduces the energy flux carried by these accelerated electrons. We systematically compute this reduction for various beam and plasma parameters relevant to solar flares. Our 1D model accounts for collisions between beam and plasma electrons, return current electric-field deceleration, thermalization in a warm target approximation, and runaway electron contributions. The results focus on the classical (Spitzer) regime, offering a valuable benchmark for energy flux reduction and its extent. Return current losses are only negligible for the lowest nonthermal fluxes. We calculate the conditions for return current losses to become significant and estimate the extent of the modification to the beam's energy flux density. We also calculate two additional conditions which occur for higher injected fluxes: (1) where runaway electrons become significant, and (2) where current-driven instabilities might become significant, requiring a model that self-consistently accounts for them. Condition (2) is relaxed and the energy flux losses are reduced in the presence of runaway electrons. All results are dependent on beam and co-spatial plasma parameters. We also examine the importance of the reflection of beam electrons by the return-current electric field. We show that the interpretation of a number of flares needs to be reviewed to account for the effects of return currents.</description>

      <title>Evolution of reconnection flux during eruption of magnetic flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powerful drivers of space weather, with magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) widely regarded as their primary precursors. However, the variation in reconnection flux during the evolution of MFR during CME eruptions remains poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic model using which we explore the temporal evolution of reconnection flux during the MFR evolution using both numerical simulations and observational data. Our initial coronal configuration features an isothermal atmosphere and a potential arcade magnetic field beneath which an MFR emerges at the lower boundary. As the MFR rises, we observe significant stretching and compression of the overlying magnetic field beneath it. Magnetic reconnection begins with the gradual formation of a current sheet, eventually culminating with the impulsive expulsion of the flux rope. We analyze the temporal evolution of reconnection fluxes during two successive MFR eruptions while continuously emerging the twisted flux rope through the lower boundary. We also conduct a similar analysis using observational data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for an eruptive event. Comparing our MHD simulation with observational data, we find that reconnection flux play a crucial role in determination of CME speeds. From the onset to the eruption, the reconnection flux shows a strong linear correlation with the velocity. This nearly realistic simulation of a solar eruption provides important insights into the complex dynamics of CME initiation and progression.</description>

      <title>Polytropic Gas Effects in Parker's Solar Wind Model and Coronal Hole Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06122</link>

Abstract: A detailed and systematic investigation of polytropic gas effects in Parker's solar wind model and coronal-hole flows is given. We present a viable equation governing the acceleration of solar wind of a polytropic gas and give its exact analytical and numerical solutions and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties (i) near the sun, (ii) far away from the sun, (iii) near the Parker sonic critical point (where the wind speed is equal to the speed of sound in the wind). We proceed to give a detailed and systematic investigation of coronal-hole polytropic gas outflows which contribute to bulk of the solar wind. We will model coronal-hole outflow by considering a single radial stream tube and use phenomenological considerations to represent its rapidly-diverging flow geometry. We give analytical and numerical solutions for this outflow and deduce its asymptotic analytic properties in the three flow regimes above. We find that, in general, the polytropic effects cause the Parker sonic critical point to move closer to the sun than that for the case with isothermal gas. Furthermore, the flow acceleration is found to exhibit (even for an infinitesimal deviation from isothermality of the gas) a power-law behavior rather than an exponential-law behavior near the sun or a logarithmic-law behavior far away from the sun, thus implying a certain robustness of the power-law behavior. The Parker sonic critical point is shown to continue to be of X-type, hence facilitating a smooth transition from subsonic to supersonic wind flow through the transonic regime. Our analytical and numerical solutions show that the super-radiality of the stream tube causes the Parker sonic critical point to move further down in the corona, and the gas to become more diabatic (the polytropic exponent gamma drops further below 5/3), and the flow acceleration to be enhanced further.</description>
