      <title>An Improved Quasi-Physical Dynamic Algorithm for Efficient Circular Coverage in Arbitrary Convex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal circle coverage problem aims to find a configuration of circles that maximizes the covered area within a given region. Although theoretical optimal solutions exist for simple cases, the problem's NP-hard characteristic makes the problem computationally intractable for complex polygons with numerous circles. Prevailing methods are largely confined to regular domains, while the few algorithms designed for irregular polygons suffer from poor initialization, unmanaged boundary effects, and excessive overlap among circles, resulting in low coverage efficiency. Consequently, we propose an Improved Quasi-Physical Dynamic(IQPD) algorithm for arbitrary convex polygons. Our core contributions are threefold: (1) proposing a structure-preserving initialization strategy that maps a hexagonal close-packing of circles into the target polygon via scaling and affine transformation; (2) constructing a virtual force field incorporating friction and a radius-expansion optimization iteration model; (3) designing a boundary-surrounding strategy based on normal and tangential gradients to retrieve overflowing circles. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art methods on seven metrics across a variety of convex polygons. This work could provide a more efficient solution for operational optimization or resource allocation in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Point Vortex Dynamics on Closed Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.</description>

      <title>Scales of Fr\'echet means and Karcher quasi-arithmetic means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that any interior point of an open interval of the real line can be interpreted as Fr\'echet means with respect to corresponding metric distances, thus extending the result of [Dinh et al., Mathematical Intelligencer 47.2 (2025)] which was restricted to intervals on the positive reals by using the family of power means: Our generic construction relies on the concept of scales of means that we demonstrate with the scale of exponential means and the scale of radical means. Second, we interpret those Fr\'echet means geometrically as the center of mass of any two distinct points on the Euclidean line expressed in various coordinate systems: Namely, by interpreting the Euclidean line as a 1D Hessian Riemannian manifold, we introduce pairs of dual Fr\'echet/Karcher means related by convex duality in dual coordinate systems. This result yields us to consider squared Hessian metrics in arbitrary dimension: We prove that these squared Hessian metrics amount to Euclidean geometry with the Riemannian center of mass expressed in primal coordinate systems as multivariate quasi-arithmetic means coinciding with left-sided Bregman centroids.</description>

      <title>On Small Pair Decompositions for Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\newcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$We study the minWSPD problem of computing the minimum-size well-separated pairs decomposition of a set of points, and show constant approximation algorithms in low-dimensional Euclidean space and doubling metrics. This problem is computationally hard already $\Re^2$, and is also hard to approximate.
  We also introduce a new pair decomposition, removing the requirement that the diameters of the parts should be small. Surprisingly, we show that in a general metric space, one can compute such a decomposition of size $O( \tfrac{n}{\varepsilon}\log n)$, which is dramatically smaller than the quadratic bound for WSPDs. In $\Re^d$, the bound improves to $O( d \tfrac{n}{\varepsilon}\log \tfrac{1}{\varepsilon } )$.</description>

      <title>Fast Reconfiguration for Programmable Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of programmable matter envisions a very large number of tiny and simple robot particles forming a smart material. Even though the particles are restricted to local communication, local movement, and simple computation, their actions can nevertheless result in the global change of the material's physical properties and geometry.
  A fundamental algorithmic task for programmable matter is to achieve global shape reconfiguration by specifying local behavior of the particles. In this paper we describe a new approach for shape reconfiguration in the \emph{amoebot} model. The amoebot model is a distributed model which significantly restricts memory, computing, and communication capacity of the individual particles. Thus the challenge lies in coordinating the actions of particles to produce the desired behavior of the global system.
  Our reconfiguration algorithm is the first algorithm that does not use a canonical intermediate configuration when transforming between arbitrary shapes. We introduce new geometric primitives for amoebots and show how to reconfigure particle systems, using these primitives, in a linear number of activation rounds in the worst case. In practice, our method exploits the geometry of the symmetric difference between input and output shape: it minimizes unnecessary disassembly and reassembly of the particle system when the symmetric difference between the initial and the target shapes is small. Furthermore, our reconfiguration algorithm moves the particles over as many parallel shortest paths as the problem instance allows.</description>

      <title>Smooth Fractal Trees: Analytic Generators and Discrete Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for constructing fractal trees via analytic generator fields, replacing discrete affine transformations and symbolic rewriting rules by the integration of smooth vector fields in an internal state space. In this setting, geometric curves are obtained as projections of generator trajectories, and branching is implemented as a primitive operation through exact inheritance of generator state.
  At every finite depth, the resulting structure is a finite union of analytic curve segments that is smooth across branch events. Two structural results relate this generator-driven construction to classical discrete models of tree-based fractals. First, a combinatorial universality theorem shows that any discrete tree specification, including those arising from iterated function systems and L-systems, can be compiled into an analytic generator tree whose induced discrete scaffold is isomorphic at every finite depth. Second, under standard contractive assumptions, a canopy set equivalence theorem establishes that the accumulation set of analytic branch endpoints coincides with the attractor of the corresponding discrete construction.
  These results separate local geometric regularity from global fractal complexity, showing that fractality is determined by recursive branching and scaling rather than by local non-smoothness. The framework provides a smooth representation of tree-based fractals that preserves both their finite combinatorial structure and their asymptotic limit geometry.</description>
