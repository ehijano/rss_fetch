      <title>Resonant Multi-Scalar Production in the Generic Complex Singlet Model in the Multi-TeV Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop benchmarks for resonant di-scalar production in the generic complex singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model (SM), which contains two new scalars. These benchmarks maximize di-scalar resonant production: $pp\rightarrow h_2 \rightarrow h_1 h_1/h_1h_3/h_3h_3$, where $h_1$ is the observed SM-like Higgs boson and $h_{2,3}$ are new scalars. The decays $h_2\rightarrow h_1h_3$ and $h_2\rightarrow h_3h_3$ may be the only way to discover $h_3$, leading to a discovery of two new scalars at once. Current LHC and projected future collider (HL-LHC, FCC-ee, ILC500) constraints are used to produce benchmarks at the HL-LHC for $h_2$ masses between 250 GeV and 1 TeV and a future $pp$ collider for $h_2$ masses between 250 GeV and 12 TeV. We update the current LHC bounds on the singlet-Higgs boson mixing angle. As the mass of $h_2$ increases, certain limiting behaviors of the maximum rates are uncovered due to theoretical constraints on the parameters. These limits, which can be derived analytically, are ${\rm BR}(h_2\rightarrow h_1h_1)\rightarrow 0.25$, ${\rm BR}(h_2\rightarrow h_3h_3)\rightarrow 0.5$, and ${\rm BR}(h_2\rightarrow h_1h_3) \rightarrow 0$. It can also be shown that the maximum rates of $pp\rightarrow h_2\rightarrow h_1h_1/h_3h_3$ approach the same value. Hence, all three $h_2\rightarrow h_ih_j$ decays are promising discovery modes for $h_2$ masses below $\mathcal{O}(1 {\rm TeV})$, while above $\mathcal{O}(1 {\rm TeV})$ the decays $h_2\rightarrow h_1h_1/h_3h_3$ are more encouraging. Masses for $h_3$ are chosen to produce a large range of signatures including multi-b, multi-vector boson, and multi-$h_1$ production. The behavior of the maximum rates imply that in the multi-TeV region this model may be discovered in the Higgs quartet production mode before Higgs triple production is observed. The maximum di- and four Higgs production rates are similar in the multi-TeV range.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type are shown to admit an explicit UV completion in a QCD-like theory with a Planckian confining scale. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <title>Pressure and speed of sound in two-flavor color-superconducting quark matter at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconfined quark matter at asymptotically high densities is weakly coupled, due to the asymptotic freedom of Quantum Chromodynamics. In this weak-coupling regime, bulk thermodynamic properties of quark matter, assuming a trivial ground state, are currently known to partial next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. However, the ground state at high densities is expected to be a color superconductor, in which the excitation spectrum of (at least some) quarks exhibit a gap with a non-perturbative dependence on the strong coupling. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of color-superconducting quark matter at high densities and zero temperature at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the coupling in the presence of a finite gap. We work in the limit of two massless quark flavors, which corresponds to deconfined symmetric nuclear matter, and further assume that the gap is small compared to the quark chemical potential. In these limits, we find that the NLO corrections to the pressure and speed of sound are comparable in size to the leading-order effects of the gap, and further increase both quantities above their values for non-superconducting quark matter. We also provide a parameterization of the NLO speed of sound to guide phenomenology in the high-density region, and we furthermore comment on whether our findings should be expected to extend to the case of three-flavor quark matter of relevance to neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A closer scrutiny of cosmic ray proton energy losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The percent-level precision attained by modern cosmic ray (CR) observations motivates reaching a comparable or better control of theoretical uncertainties. Here we focus on energy-loss processes affecting low-energy CR protons ($\sim 0.1-5$ GeV), where the experimental errors are small and collisional effects play a comparatively larger role with respect to collisionless transport ones. We study three aspects of the problem: i) We quantitatively assess the role of the nuclear elastic cross-section, for the first time, providing analytical formulae for the stopping power and inelasticity. ii) We discuss the error arising from treating both elastic and pion production inelastic interactions as continuous energy loss processes, as opposed to catastrophic ones. The former is the approximation used in virtually all modern numerical calculations. iii) We consider sub-leading effects such as relativistic corrections, radiative and medium processes in ionization energy-losses. Our analysis reveals that neglecting i) leads to errors close to 1%, notably around and below 1 GeV; neglecting ii) leads to errors reaching about 3% within the considered energy range; iii) contributes to a minor effect, gauged at the level of 0.1%. Consequently, while iii) can currently be neglected, ii) warrants consideration, and we also recommend incorporating i) into computations. We conclude with some perspectives on further steps to be taken towards a high-precision goal of theoretical CR predictions regarding the treatment of energy-losses.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement and Bell non-locality in loop-induced Higgs boson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum entanglement properties of the three-body $H\to\gamma l\bar{l}$ decays (for $l=e,\mu,\tau$) within the context of the Standard Model augmented with CP-violating interactions in the lepton Yukawa sector. Our aim is to elucidate the distribution of entanglement between the final photon, lepton and antilepton across the phase-space. These rare Higgs boson decays occur at 1-loop level, presenting a unique opportunity to scrutinize quantum correlations of fundamental interactions in tripartite systems by computing concurrence measures and investigating Bell non-locality. Moreover, we explore post-decay and autodistillation phenomena. Multipartite entanglement measures have much richer structure than those in the bipartite case, thus deserve more attention in collider phenomenology. In this line, we analyze here novel observables for these three-body Higgs boson decays, which can be extended to other multiparticle systems within the high-energy regime. We found that entanglement manifests among final particles, occasionally achieving a maximally entangled state in specific kinematical configurations. Also, these decay channels are promising for Bell non-locality tests but CP-effects are suppressed by lepton masses in this kind of observables.</description>

      <title>Exact and Leading Order Radiative Effects in Semi-inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative effects in semi-inclusive hadron leptoproduction of unpolarized particles are calculated within the leading order approximation. The contributions of the infrared-free sum of the effects of real and virtual photon emission as well as the contribution of exclusive radiative tail are considered. It is demonstrated how the obtained formulae in the leading log approximation can be obtained using the standard approach of the leading log approximation as well as from the exact expressions for the radiative correction of the lowest order. The method of the electron structure function is used to calculate the higher order corrections. The results are analytically compared to the results obtained by other groups. Numeric illustrations are given in the kinematics of the modern experiments at Jefferson Laboratory.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Field Theory for the interaction of pions and rhos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Kroll-Lee-Zumino model in its particle content to include the charged rho vector mesons and the neutral pion meson. This entailed using the larger SU(2) gauge group. The masses for the vector mesons were generated via spontaneous symmetry breaking using the Higgs mechanism. The Lagrangian was then quantized and gauge fixed using the generalized class of $R_\xi$ gauges. Tree scattering lengths were calculated for pion-pion scattering and the values for the $a^0_0$ and $a^2_0$ scattering lengths are found to be comparable with experiment. The one particle irreducible diagrams that contribute to the one loop corrections to the tree scattering lengths are renormalized.</description>

      <title>Chiral Corrections to the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner Relation from QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the next-to-leading order corrections to the $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ and $SU(3)\otimes SU(3)$ Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relations. We use a pseudoscalar correlator calculated from Perturbative QCD up to five loops and use the QCD Finite Energy Sum Rules with integration kernels tuned to suppress the importance of the hadronic resonances. This leads to a substantial reduction in the systematic uncertainties from the experimentally unknown resonance spectral function. We use the method of Fixed Order and Fixed Renormalization Scale Perturbation Theory to compute the integrals. We calculate these corrections to be $\delta_\pi = 0.060 \pm 0.014$ and $\delta _K =0.64 \pm 0.24$. As a result of these new values, we predict the value of the light quark condensate $\left\langle {0|\bar qq|0} \right\rangle = - \left( {266 \pm 5{\text{ MeV}}} \right)^3$ and the Chiral Perturbation Theory low energy constant $H_2^r = - \left( {4.9 \pm 1.8} \right) \times 10^{ - 3}$.

      <title>Local quench within the Keldysh technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of quantum scalar field evolution after an instantaneous local perturbation (quench) is considered. A new approach to descriptions of a quench from an arbitrary initial state is developed in the framework of the Keldysh technique. This approach does not require the procedure of the analytical continuation, which can be ambiguous in some cases. The evolution of the energy density after local quench is calculated for a simple case, and its dependence on the interaction region width and the initial conditions is analysed.</description>

      <title>Parity doublet model for baryon octets: ground states saturated by good diquarks and the role of bad diquarks for excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity doublet model is an effective chiral model that includes the chiral variant and invariant masses of baryons. The chiral invariant mass has large impacts on the density dependence of models which can be constrained by neutron star observations. In the previous work, models of two-flavors have been considered up to a few times nuclear saturation density, but in such dense region it is also necessary to consider hyperons. With the chiral invariant masses baryons can stay massive in extreme environments (e.g., neutron stars) where the chiral symmetry restoration takes place. In this work, we generalize the previous $\mbox{SU(2)}_L \times \mbox{SU(2)}_R$ parity models of nucleons to $\mbox{SU(3)}_L \times \mbox{SU(3)}_R$ models of the baryon octet, within the linear realization of the chiral symmetry. The major problem in constructing such models has been too many candidates for the chiral representations of baryons. Motivated by the concepts of diquarks and the mended symmetry, we choose the $(3_L, \bar{3}_R) + (\bar{3}_L, 3_R)$, $(3_L, 6_R) + (6_L, 3_R)$ and $(1_L, 8_R) + (8_L, 1_R)$ representations and use quark diagrams to constrain the possible types of Yukawa interactions. The masses of the baryon octets for positive and negative baryons up to the first excitations are successfully reproduced. As expected from the diquark considerations, the ground state baryons are well dominated by $(3_L, \bar{3}_R) + (\bar{3}_L, 3_R)$ and $(1_L, 8_R) + (8_L, 1_R)$ representations, while the excited states require $(3_L, 6_R) + (6_L, 3_R)$ representations. Important applications of our model are the chiral restoration for strange quarks at large density and the continuity of diquarks from hadronic to quark matter. We also address the problem of large Yukawa couplings which are enhanced in three-flavor construction.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today. In fact, a purely kinematic triangle mechanism is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements. We also identify the type of dynamic pole structure that can be misidentified as triangle enhancement. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a single triangle singularity, and the pole-based interpretation is more favored for this signal. Lastly, we argue how our method can be used as a model-selection framework to help in classifying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

      <title>Identifying the transverse and longitudinal modes of the $K^*$ and $K_{1}$ mesons through their angular dependent decay modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing the mass shifts of chiral partners will provide invaluable insight into the role of chiral symmetry breaking in the generation of hadron masses. Because both the $K^*$ and $K_1$ mesons have vacuum widths smaller than 100 MeV, they are ideal candidates for realizing mass shift measurements. On the other hand, the different momentum dependence of the longitudinal and transverse modes smear the peak positions. In this work, we analyze the angular dependence of the two-body decays of both the $K^*$ and $K_1$. It is found that the longitudinal and transverse modes of the $K^*$ can be isolated by observing the pseudoscalar decay in either the forward or perpendicular directions, respectively. For the $K_1$ decaying into a vector meson and a pseudoscalar meson, one can accomplish the same goal by further observing the polarization of the vector meson through its angular dependence on the two pseudoscalar meson decay.</description>

      <title>The role of hidden-color components in the tetraquark mixing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiquarks can have two-hadron components and hidden-color components in their wave functions. The presence of two-hadron components in multiquarks introduces a potential source of confusion, particularly with respect to their resemblance to hadronic molecules. On the other hand, hidden-color components are essential for distinguishing between multiquarks and hadronic molecules. In this work, we study the hidden-color components in the wave functions of the tetraquark mixing model, a model that has been proposed as a suitable framework for describing the properties of two nonets in the $J^P=0^+$ channel: the light nonet [$a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (700)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$] and the heavy nonet [$a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$]. Our analysis reveals a substantial presence of hidden-color components within the tetraquark wave functions. To elucidate the impact of hidden-color components on physical quantities, we conduct computations of the hyperfine masses, $\langle V_{CS}\rangle$, for the two nonets, considering scenarios involving only the two-meson components and those incorporating the hidden-color components. We demonstrate that the hidden-color components constitute an important part of the hyperfine masses, such that the mass difference formula, $\Delta M\approx \Delta \langle V_{CS}\rangle$, which has been successful for the two nonets, cannot be achieved without the hidden-color contributions. This can provide another evidence supporting the tetraquark nature of the two nonets.</description>

      <title>A Novel Proton Decay Signature at DUNE, JUNO, and Hyper-K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton decay, although unobserved so far, is a natural expectation when attempting to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. $p\to K^+\bar{\nu}$ or $p\to K^+\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, with $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ a light exotic neutral particle, represent possible decay channels achievable in models of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the MSSM with trilinear R-parity-violating terms, or the Standard Model extended by a heavy neutral lepton. Among the decay products of these modes, the neutral fermions would typically appear as missing energy in collider searches. The present study considers how such decay modes could be differentiated in experimental settings, as the exotic $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ may further decay if it is not protected by a symmetry (such as R-parity in the MSSM). We assess the detection prospects of the proposed experiments DUNE, JUNO and Hyper-K in this context.</description>

      <title>One flow to correct them all: improving simulations in high-energy physics with a single normalising flow and a switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated events are key ingredients in almost all high-energy physics analyses. However, imperfections in the simulation can lead to sizeable differences between the observed data and simulated events. The effects of such mismodelling on relevant observables must be corrected either effectively via scale factors, with weights or by modifying the distributions of the observables and their correlations. We introduce a correction method that transforms one multidimensional distribution (simulation) into another one (data) using a simple architecture based on a single normalising flow with a boolean condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a physics-inspired toy dataset with non-trivial mismodelling of several observables and their correlations.</description>

      <title>Flavored leptogenesis from a sudden mass gain of right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to point out that in the scenario that the right-handed neutrinos suddenly gain some masses much larger than the temperature of the Universe at that time so that the washout effects for the generated lepton asymmetry can be safely neglected, the flavored leptogenesis (which crucially rely on the flavor non-universality of the washout effects) cannot work in the usual way any more. For this problem, we put forward that the flavor non-universality of the conversion efficiencies from the lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron processes may play a crucial role. And we will study if the requisite baryon asymmetry can be successfully reproduced from such a mechanism in the scenarios that the right-handed neutrino masses are hierarchical and nearly degenerate, respectively. A detailed study shows that this mechanism can be viable in both these two scenarios.</description>

      <title>The effect of cutoff dependence on heavy quark spin symmetry partners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadron spectroscopy is revealed by observing heavy resonances. Among various explanations of the internal structure of these hadronic states, hadronic molecules play a unique role. For hadronic molecules, which are associated with meson-meson or meson-baryon interactions, the $\Lambda$ cutoff is a significant factor in determining the composite states' binding energies and overall properties. The cutoff becomes important when it comes to the location of hadronic molecules' masses because it influences the predictions. From this perspective, in the light of cutoff dependency, heavy quark spin partners of near-threshold the $\chi_{c0}(3915)$, $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ resonances, which are considered as hadronic molecules, are examined.</description>

      <title>Revisit the heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the masses of heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules. Considering the $\bar QGGQ$ operators in the $(\mathbf{8}_{[\bar{Q}Q]} \otimes \mathbf{8}_{[GG]})$ color structure, we have constructed two independent interpolating currents with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and five independent currents with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$, in which the glueball operators can be symmetric $d^{rst}G^{s}_{\mu\nu}G^{t}_{\alpha\beta}$ or antisymmetric $f^{rst}G^{s}_{\mu\nu}G^{t}_{\alpha\beta}$. For the interpolating currents with antisymmetric glueball operator $f^{rst}G^{s}_{\mu\nu}G^{t}_{\alpha\beta}$, there exist non-local divergences in one kind of additional Feynman diagrams of tri-gluon condensate, which will give important contributions to the sum rule stabilities and mass predictions. We use the diagrammatic operator renormalization to cancel out such divergences. At the leading order of $\alpha_s$, the two-point correlation functions and spectral densities can be expressed in the analytic form of the generalized hypergeometric functions and Meijer's G-functions. After performing the numerical analysis, we predict the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons to be around $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. For the bottomonium systems, their masses are predicted to be $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Besides, it is possible to hunt for these charmonium $\bar{c}GGc$ hybrids in the radiative decays of $\Upsilon (nS)$ and $\chi_{bJ}$ mesons in BelleII experiment. Further investigations on these hybrid states in various theoretical and phenomenological methods are also anticipated in the future.</description>

      <title>Bridging hadronic and vacuum structure by heavy quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the central and, mostly, spin-dependent potentials in heavy quarkonia $\bar b b, \bar c c$, with two goals in mind. The first is phenomenological: using the splitting between the 1S and 2S pairs, as well as the 1P and 2P quartet masses, we obtain very accurate values of all matrix elements of the spin-depepdent potentials. The second is theoretical: using standard wave functions, we compute these matrix elements, from perturbative, nonperturbative and ``string" contributions. The model for nonperturbative effects is a ``dense instanton liquid model", in which the QCD vacuum is made of (strongly color correlated) instanton-antiinstanton pairs or "molecules". We calcuate their effect via standard Wilson lines, with or without extra powers of gauge fields. We find that this model provides a reasonable description of all central, spin-spin and spin-orbit forces at distances $r= 0-0.7 \, fm $, relevant for $\bar b b $ and $\bar c c$ quarkonia.</description>

      <title>Identifying CP Basis Invariants in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our automated framework that uses ring diagrams for classifying CP basis invariants [1], this paper broadens the application of the methodology with more extensive examples and a wider scope of theoretical frameworks. Here, we showcase its versatility through detailed analyses in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) up to dim-2n, and SMEFT with sterile neutrinos ({\nu}SMEFT) up to dimension-7. By integrating the ring-diagram technique with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we have developed a system that not only simplifies the process of identifying basic and joint invariants but also enables the automatic differentiation between CP-even and CP-odd invariants from the lowest orders. Additionally, this work presents a comparison of our results with those derived using the traditional Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and its Plethystic logarithm. While these conventional approaches primarily yield the numerical count of invariants, our framework provides a complete structure of invariants, thereby surpassing the limitations of these traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative $T$-odd contributions to the lepton angular distribution in the Drell-Yan process. Using collinear factorization, we work at the first order in QCD perturbation theory where these contributions appear, ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$, and address both $W^\pm$ and $\gamma/Z^0$ boson exchange. A major focus of our calculation is on the regime where the boson's transverse momentum $Q_T$ is much smaller than its mass $Q$. We carefully expand our results up to next-to-next-to-leading power in $Q_T/Q$. Our calculation provides a benchmark for studies of $T$-odd contributions that employ transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions. In the neutral-current case we compare our results for the $T$-odd structure functions to available ATLAS data.</description>

      <title>Rindler Fluids from Gravitational Shockwaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between gravitational shockwave geometry and its fluid description near a Rindler horizon in Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the Petrov classification that describes algebraic symmetries for Lorentzian spaces, we establish an explicit mapping between a potential fluid and the shockwave metric perturbation, where the Einstein equation for the shockwave geometry is equivalent to the incompressibility condition of the fluid, augmented by a shockwave source. Then we consider an Ansatz of a stochastic quantum source for the potential fluid, which has the physical interpretation of shockwaves created by vacuum energy fluctuations. Under such circumstance, the Einstein equation, or equivalently, the incompressibility condition for the fluid, becomes a stochastic differential equation. By smearing the quantum source on a stretched horizon in a Lorentz invariant manner with a Planckian width (similarly to the membrane paradigm), we integrate fluctuations near the Rindler horizon to find an accumulated effect of the variance in the round-trip time of a photon traversing the horizon of a causal diamond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for computing multi-loop scattering amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory. It extends the Generalized Unitarity method by constraining not only the integrand of the amplitude but also its full integrated form. Our approach exploits the relation between cuts and discontinuities of the amplitude. Explicitly, by the virtue of analyticity and unitarity of the S-matrix, the amplitude can be expressed in terms of lower-loop on-shell amplitudes dispersively integrated along cuts. As both cuts and discontinuities can be computed systematically in dimensional regularization, we validated our method by reproducing the four-gluon amplitude in two-loop massless Quantum Chromodynamics. Moreover, since our approach improves the performance of the calculation, we provide a new result for the four-loop four-point massless planar ladder Feynman integral. It is expressed in terms of Harmonic Polylogarithms with letters 0 and 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly interacting massive particles, which may aggregate into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies, forming dense spikes. Employing Schwarzschild geometry, we assess the density and velocity distribution of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in the density profile of DM and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves (GWs) generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes. Our findings uncover phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing significant insights for the GW-based detection of DM in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>The SZ effect with anisotropic distributions and high energy electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect promise ever improving measurements in terms of both sensitivity and angular resolution. As such, it is increasingly relevant to model `higher-order' contributions to the SZ effect. This work examines the effects of high-energy non-thermal electron distributions and those of anisotropic electron and photon distributions on the SZ signals. Analytic forms of the anisotropic scattering kernels for photons and electrons have been derived and investigated. We present a method for determining the anisotropic contributions through a spherical harmonic decomposition to arbitrary angular multipoles, and discuss the behaviour of these scattering kernels. We then carry out an exploration of various simplistic models of high energy non-thermal electron distributions, and examine their anisotropic behaviour. The kinematic SZ in the relativistic regime is studied using the kernel formulation allowing us to clarifying the role of kinematic corrections to the scattering optical depth. We finally present a release of an updated and refined version of SZpack including a new integrated Python interface and new modules for the calculation of various SZ signals, including those described in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the accretion process in a thin disk surrounding a supermassive black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity by using the Novikov-Thorne model. Our exploration focuses on understanding the impact of the model parameter on various physical properties of the disk. The results reveal that as the dilaton parameter $r_2$ increases, the energy flux, radiation temperature, spectra luminosity, and conversion efficiency of the disk all increase. By narrowing down the dilaton parameter range to $0\leqslant r_2\leqslant0.4$ M, we discover that in the high-frequency region, the Kerr-Sen black hole demonstrates higher energy output compared to the Kerr black hole. This facilitates a more straightforward examination of the observational results for two black holes.</description>

      <title>Cavity Detection of Gravitational Waves: Where Do We Stand?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

Abstract: In this talk, we study a scalar $O(N)$ model with a so-called moat regime -- a regime with negative bosonic wave function renormalization -- using lattice field theory. For negative bare wave function renormalization, inhomogeneous condensates are solutions of the classical equations of motions. Using hybrid Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate how bosonic quantum fluctuations disorder the inhomogeneous condensate. Instead, one finds a so-called Quantum Pion Liquid, where bosonic correlation functions are spatially oscillating, but also exponentially decaying.</description>

      <title>Late-forming black holes and the antiproton, gamma-ray, and anti-helium excesses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes long-lived enough to be the dark matter have temperatures below the MeV. Since Hawking evaporation is a quasi-thermal process, no GeV emission is predicted to be produced by black holes if they are part, or all, of the cosmological dark matter. However, black holes could be ``spawned'' at late times with masses that correspond to short lifetimes, and as such be significantly hotter and produce particles well in excess of the GeV. Here, we show that such late-forming black holes could, at once, explain the tantalizing excesses found in the gamma radiation from the Galactic center, in the flux of cosmic-ray antiproton, and in the few tentative antihelium events reported by the anti-matter spectrometer AMS-02. We compute accurate predictions for the anti-deuteron, high-energy neutrino, and positron fluxes if this scenario is realized in nature. We find that while the neutrino and positron fluxes are too small compared to the expected background, a significant number of anti-deuteron events is expected both at AMS-02 and at the future General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-threshold $p\bar\Lambda$ mass spectra for the reactions $e^+e^- \to K^- p\bar\Lambda$ and $J/\psi \to K^- p\bar\Lambda$ are investigated with an emphasis on the role played by the interaction in the $p\bar\Lambda$ system. As guideline for the $p\bar\Lambda$ interaction a variety of $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ potential models is considered that have been established in the analysis of data on $p\bar p\to \Lambda\bar\Lambda$ in the past. Arguments why the properties of the $p\bar\Lambda$ and $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ interactions can be expected to be very similar are provided. It is shown that the near-threshold enhancement in the invariant mass observed for the $e^+e^-$ reaction can be reproduced quantitatively by the assumed $p\bar\Lambda$ final-state interaction in the partial wave suggested by an amplitude analysis of the experiment. The effect of the $p\bar\Lambda$ final-state interaction in other decays is explored, including the recently measured reactions $B^- \to J/\psi\, \bar p \Lambda$ and $B^+ \to J/\psi\, p \bar\Lambda$. It is found that the final-state interaction improves the description of the measured invariant mass near threshold in most cases.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs). We consider hadronic matter modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model based on the neutron decay anomaly. We study the non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters and NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.</description>

      <title>Probing high scale seesaw and PBH generated dark matter via gravitational waves with multiple tilts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scenario where a high scale seesaw origin of light neutrino mass and gravitational dark matter (DM) in MeV-TeV ballpark originating from primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation can be simultaneously probed by future observations of stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background with multiple tilts or spectral breaks. A high scale breaking of an Abelian gauge symmetry ensures the dynamical origin of the seesaw scale while also leading to the formation of cosmic strings responsible for generating stochastic GW background. The requirement of a correct DM relic in this ballpark necessitates the inclusion of a diluter as PBH typically leads to DM overproduction. This leads to a second early matter dominated epoch after PBH evaporation due to the long-lived diluter. These two early matter dominated epochs, crucially connected to the DM relic, lead to multiple spectral breaks in the otherwise scale-invariant GW spectrum formed by cosmic strings. We find interesting correlations between DM mass and turning point frequencies of GW spectrum which are within reach of several near future experiments like LISA, BBO, ET, CE, etc.</description>

      <title>Predicting Neutrino Mixing Angles Using Group Presentations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By assuming there exist three massive non-degenerate Majorana neutrinos, it is possible to describe neutrino mixing with a residual, unbroken discrete Klein subgroup of a larger spontaneously broken flavor symmetry group. Motivated by forthcoming measurements of leptonic CP violation, we revisit this framework by applying group presentation rules to it. We develop a method that is able to reproduce all previous results in the literature and may also hint at a possible group theoretical origin of CP violation in the Klein symmetry elements. This is due to the explicit appearance of a phase in them. However, for the cases considered in this analysis, it turns out that this phase can be removed. Still, this new method warrants further study.</description>

      <title>Parametric resonance in abelian and non-abelian gauge fields via space-time oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of abelian $U(1)$ electromagnetic as well as non-abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields, in the presence of space-time oscillations. Analysis of the time evolution of abelian gauge fields shows the presence of parametric resonance in spatial modes. A similar analysis in the case of non-abelian gauge fields, in the linear approximation, shows the presence of the same resonant spatial modes. The resonant modes induce large fluctuations in physical observables including those that break the $CP-$symmetry. We also carry out time evolution of small random fluctuations of the gauge fields, using numerical simulations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. These simulations help to study non-linear effects in the case of non-abelian gauge theories. Our results show that there is an increase in energy density with the coupling, at late times. These results suggest that gravitational waves may excite non-abelian gauge fields more efficiently than electromagnetic fields. Also, gravitational waves in the early Universe and from the merger of neutron stars, black holes etc. may enhance $CP-$violation and generate an imbalance in chiral charge distributions, magnetic fields etc.</description>

      <title>The complex heavy-quark potential with the Gribov-Zwanziger action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gribov-Zwanziger prescription in Yang-Mills theory improves the infrared dynamics. In this work, we study the static potential of a heavy quark-antiquark pair with the HTL resummed perturbation method within the Gribov-Zwanziger approach at finite temperature. The real and imaginary parts of the heavy quark complex potential are obtained from the one-loop effective static gluon propagator. The one-loop effective gluon propagator is obtained by calculating the one-loop gluon self-energies containing the quark, gluon, and ghost loop. The gluon and ghost loops are modified in the presence of the Gribov parameter. We also calculate the decay width from the imaginary part of the potential. We also discuss the medium effect of heavy quark potential with the localized action via auxiliary fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elastic pion-proton and pion-pion scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Taking into account the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, which are described by the Reggeized $2^{++}$ glueball and vector meson propagator respectively, the total and differential cross sections are calculated. The adjustable parameters involved in the model are determined with the experimental data of the pion-proton total cross sections. The differential cross sections can be predicted without any additional parameters, and it is shown that our predictions are consistent with the data. The energy dependence of the Pomeron and Reggeon contribution is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Interpreting the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set as Early Universe Gravitational Waves Produced by ALP Induced Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a possible early universe source for the recent observation of a stochastic gravitational wave background at the NANOGrav pulsar timing array. The source is a tachyonic instability in a dark gauge field induced by an axion-like particle (ALP), a known source for gravitational waves. We find that relative to the previous analysis with the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, the current 15-year data set favors parameter space with a relatively larger axion mass and decay constant. This favored parameter space is heavily constrained by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and overproduction of ALP dark matter. While there are potential mechanisms for avoiding the second problem, evading the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint remains highly challenging. In particular, we find that the gravitational wave magnitude is significantly suppressed with respect to the gauge boson dark radiation, which implies that successfully explaining the NANOGrav observation requires a large additional dark radiation, violating the cosmological constraints. Satisfying the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint will limit the potential contribution from this mechanism to the observed signal to at most a percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient approach for the general reduction of one-loop integrals. Our method employs the introduction of an auxiliary vector and the identification of the tensor structure as an auxiliary propagator. This key insight allows us to express a wide range of one-loop integrals, encompassing both tensor structures and higher poles, in the Baikov representation. By establishing an integral-by-parts (IBP) relation, we derive a recursive formula that systematically solves the one-loop reduction problem, even in the presence of various degenerate cases. Our proposed strategy is characterized by its simplicity and effectiveness, offering a significant advancement in the field of one-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>A Leptonic ALP Portal to the Dark Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the leptonic ALP portal as a simple scenario that connects observed discrepancies in anomalous magnetic moments to the Dark Matter relic abundance. In this framework an axion-like particle in the multi-MeV range couples to SM leptons and a DM fermion, with mass above the ALP mass but below a GeV. The ALP contributes to $(g-2)_\mu$ and $(g-2)_e$ dominantly through 2-loop Barr-Zee diagrams, while the DM abundance is generated by $p$-wave annihilation to ALP pairs. Constraints from beam-dump experiments, colliders and CMB probes are very stringent, and restrict the viable parameter space to a rather narrow region that will be tested in the near future.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization and spin alignment from quantum kinetic theory with self-energy corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the quantum kinetic theory for massive fermions with collision terms and self-energy corrections based on quantum field theory. We adopt an effective power counting scheme with $\hbar$ expansion to obtain the leading-order perturbative solutions of the vector and axial Wigner functions and the corresponding kinetic equations. We observe that both the onshell relation and the structure of Wigner functions, along with the kinetic equations, are modified due to the presence of self-energies and their space-time gradients. We further apply our formalism to investigate the spin polarization phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions and derive the modification to the spin polarization spectrum of massive quarks. We find that the gradient of vector self-energy plays a similar role to the background electromagnetic fields, which induces a more dominant contribution than the collisional effects by a naive power counting in the gradient expansion and weak coupling. Our findings could further modify the spin polarization of strange quarks and spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons beyond local thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Incoherent ${\rm J}/\psi$ production at large $|t|$ identifies the onset of saturation at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict that the onset of gluon saturation can be uniquely identified using incoherent ${\rm J}/\psi$ production in Pb$\unicode{x2013}$Pb collisions at currently accessible energies of the LHC. The diffractive incoherent photo-production of a ${\rm J}/\psi$ vector meson off a hadron provides information on the partonic structure of the hadron. Within the Good-Walker approach it specifically measures the variance over possible target configurations of the hadronic colour field. For this process then, gluon saturation sets in when the cross section reaches a maximum, as a function of the centre-of-mass energy of the photon-hadron system ($W$), and then decreases. We benchmark the energy-dependent hot-spot model against data from HERA and the LHC and demonstrate a good description of the available data. We show that the study of the energy dependence of the incoherent production of ${\rm J}/\psi$ allows us to pinpoint the onset of saturation effects by selecting the region of Mandelstam-$t$ around 1 GeV$^2$ where the contribution of hot spots is dominant. We predict the onset of saturation in a Pb target to occur for $W$ around a few hundred GeV. This can be measured with current data in ultra-peripheral Pb$\unicode{x2013}$Pb collisions at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: Current measurement of the $h\to Z\gamma$ signal strength invite us to speculate about possible new physics interactions that exclusively affect $\mu_{Z\gamma}$ without altering the other signal strengths. Additional consideration of tree-unitarity enables us to correlate the nonstandard values of $\mu_{Z\gamma}$ with an upper limit on the scale of new physics. We find that even when $\mu_{Z\gamma}$ deviates from the SM value by only $20\%$, the scale of new physics should be well within the reach of the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an optically active medium, such as a plasma that contains a neutrino background, the left-handed and right-handed polarization photon modes acquire different dispersion relations. We study the propagation of photons in such a medium, which is otherwise isotropic, within the framework of the covariant collissionless Boltzmann equation incorporating a term that parametrizes the optical activity. Using the linear response approximation, we obtain the formulas for the components of the photon polarization tensor, expressed in terms of integrals over the momentum distribution function of the background particles. The main result here is the formula for the P- and CP-breaking component of the photon polarization tensor in terms of the parameter involved in the new term we consider in the Boltzmann equation to describe the effects of optical activity. We discuss the results for some particular cases, such as long-wavelength and non-relativistic limits, for illustrate purposes. We also discuss the generalizations of the P- and CP-breaking term we included in the Boltzmann equation. In particular we consider the application to a plasma with a neutrino background and establish contact with calculations of the photon self-energy in those systems in the framework of Thermal Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Hypercharge Anapole Dark Matter in All Spin Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a combined analysis to investigate dark matter (DM) with hypercharge anapole moments, focusing on scenarios where Majorana DM particles with spin 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 interact exclusively with Standard Model particles through U(1)$_{Y}$ hypercharge anapole terms for the first time. For completeness, we construct general effective U(1) gauge-invariant three-point vertices. These enable the generation of hypercharge gauge-invariant interaction vertices for both a virtual photon $\gamma$ and a virtual $Z$ boson with two identical massive Majorana particles of any non-zero spin $s$, after the spontaneous breaking of electroweak gauge symmetry. For complementarity, we adopt effective operators tailored to each dark matter spin allowing crossing symmetry. We calculate the relic abundance, analyze current constraints and future sensitivities from dark matter direct detection and collider experiments, and apply the conceptual naive perturbativity bound. Our estimations based on a generalized vertex calculation demonstrate that the scenario with a higher-spin DM is more stringently constrained than a lower-spin DM, primarily due to the reduced annihilation cross-section and/or the enhanced rate of LHC mono-jet events. As a remarkable outcome, the spin-2 anapole DM scenario is almost entirely excluded, while the high-luminosity LHC exhibits high sensitivities in probing spin-1 and 3/2 scenarios, except for a tiny parameter range of DM mass around 1 TeV. A significant portion of the remaining parameter space in the spin-1/2 DM scenario can be explored through upcoming Xenon experiments, with more than 20 ton-year exposure equivalent to approximately 5 years of running the XENONnT experiment.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Solar Chameleons in the Earth's Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chameleon dark energy models are a popular alternative to the standard cosmological constant model. These models consist of a new light degree of freedom, called chameleon, with a density dependent mass and a non-trivial coupling to both matter and photons. Owing to these couplings, chameleons can be produced inside the sun. However due to their density dependent mass, the chameleons produced in the solar core are screened and cannot escape whereas those produced outside the solar core, such as in the \textit{tachocline} region with energies of the order of few a keV, can escape from the sun and travel all the way towards Earth. Hence the Earth is expected to receive a flux of \textit{solar chameleons}. In this work we propose a \textit{light shining through wall} (LSW) type of experiment in which the Earth itself acts as a wall. Both photons and chameleons are incident on the light side of the Earth. While all the photons are stopped by the Earth, only a fraction of the chameleons are stopped by the earth due to screening. Those chameleons which are not screened by the earth pass directly through the Earth and exit the night side. Here these chameleons interact with the geomagnetic field and convert into X-ray photons. A space based X-ray telescope orbiting the Earth can detect these X-ray photons, while passing through the night side, thereby acting as a detector in this LSW type experiment. We show that such a kind of setup can be complementary to other terrestrial experiments looking for chameleons.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electromagnetic properties including the M1 radiative decay widths and the magnetic moments of the isoscalar $\Xi_{c c} D^{(*)}$, $\Xi_{cc}D_{1}$, and $\Xi_{cc}D_{2}^{*}$ triple-charm molecular-type pentaquark candidates, where we adopt the constituent quark model and consider both the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect. Our numerical results suggest that the M1 radiative decay widths and the magnetic moments of the isoscalar $\Xi_{c c} D^{(*)}$, $\Xi_{cc}D_{1}$, and $\Xi_{cc}D_{2}^{*}$ triple-charm molecular-type pentaquark candidates can reflect their inner structures, and the study of the electromagnetic properties is the important step to construct the family of the triple-charm molecular-type pentaquarks. With the accumulation of the experimental data during the high-luminosity phase of LHC, we expect that the present work combined with the corresponding mass spectrum information can encourage the experimental colleagues at LHCb to focus on the isoscalar $\Xi_{c c} D^{(*)}$, $\Xi_{cc}D_{1}$, and $\Xi_{cc}D_{2}^{*}$ triple-charm molecular-type pentaquark candidates.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare the methods of our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.011 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.055$. However, as first noted in [1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and lightly supervised learning in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the main applications of machine learning models that are not fully supervised in particle physics, i.e., clustering, anomaly detection, detector simulation, and unfolding. Unsupervised methods are ideal for anomaly detection tasks -- machine learning models can be trained on background data to identify deviations if we model the background data precisely. The learning can also be partially unsupervised when we can provide some information about the anomalies at the data level. Generative models are useful in speeding up detector simulations -- they can mimic the computationally intensive task without large resources. They can also efficiently map detector-level data to parton-level data (i.e., data unfolding). In this review, we focus on interesting ideas and connections and briefly overview the underlying techniques wherever necessary.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Affleck-Dine mechanism for primordial black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a primordial black hole (PBH) formation scenario based on the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism and investigate two PBH mass regions: $M \sim 30 M_\odot$ motivated by the LIGO-Virgo observations of the binary black hole mergers and $M \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$ motivated by the observations of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. In the previous studies, it has been considered that the inhomogeneous AD baryogenesis generates regions with a large baryon asymmetry, some of which collapse into PBHs. In this paper, we show that this scenario is severely constrained due to the baryon asymmetry remaining outside PBHs, which would spoil the success of the big bang nucleosynthesis. Then, we propose an alternative scenario where the AD leptogenesis results in the inhomogeneous formation of Q-balls with lepton charges, which collapse into PBHs. As a result, we find that our scenario can explain the favorable PBH abundance without conflicting with the observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of quantum black and white hole horizons in an improved dynamic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum geometric effects near the locations where classical black hole horizons used to appear in Einstein's classical theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.</description>

      <title>Constraining the onset density for the QCD phase transition with the neutrino signal from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark matter phase transition at high baryon densities is investigated in astrophysical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, to decipher yet incompletely understood properties of the dense matter equation of state (EOS) using neutrinos from such cosmic events. It is found that the emission of a nonstandard second neutrino burst, dominated by electron antineutrinos, is not only a measurable signal for the appearance of deconfined quark matter but also reveals information about the state of matter at extreme conditions encountered at the supernova (SN) interior. To this end, a large set of spherically symmetric SN models is investigated, studying the dependence on the EOS and the stellar progenitor. General relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics is employed featuring three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic hadron-quark hybrid matter EOS class. Therefore, the DD2 relativistic mean-field hadronic model is employed, and several variations of it, and the string-flip model for the description of deconfined quark matter. The resulting hybrid model covers a representative range of onset densities for the phase transition and latent heats. This facilitates the direct connection between intrinsic signatures of the neutrino signal and properties of the EOS. In particular, a set of linear relations has been found empirically. These potentially provide a constraint for the onset density of a possible QCD phase transition from the future neutrino observation of the next galactic core-collapse SN, if a millisecond electron anti-neutrino burst is present around or less than 1s.</description>

      <title>Searches for axion-like particles via $\gamma \gamma$ fusion at future $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Opportunities for searches for axion-like particles (ALPs) coupling to photons in $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collisions at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) and International Linear Collider (ILC) are investigated. We perform a study of the photon-fusion production of ALPs decaying into two photons, $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^- \overset{\gamma \gamma}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{e}^{+}\;a(\gamma \gamma)\;\mathrm{e}^{-}$, over the light-by-light continuum background, for the planned FCC-ee and ILC center-of-mass energies and integrated luminosities. An analysis of the feasibility measurements is presented using parametrized simulations for two types of detectors. Upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the cross section for ALP production, $\sigma(\gamma \gamma \to a \to \gamma \gamma)$, and on the ALP-photon coupling are obtained over the $m_a \approx 0.1$--1000 GeV ALP mass range, and compared to current and future collider searches. Production cross sections down to $\sigma(\gamma \gamma \to a \to \gamma \gamma) \approx 1$ fb (1 ab) will be probed at $m_a\approx 1$ (300) GeV, corresponding to constraints on the axion-photon coupling as low as $g_\mathrm{a\gamma \gamma} \approx 2\cdot10^{-3}$ TeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for compact stars with exotic degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of the highly dense matter inside the supernova remnant compact star is not constrained by terrestrial experiments and hence modeled phenomenologically to accommodate the astrophysical observations from compact stars. The observable properties of the compact stars are highly sensitive to the microscopic model of highly dense matter. However, some universal relations exist between some macroscopic properties of compact stars independent of the matter model. We study the universal relation including the stars containing exotic degrees of freedom such as heavier strange and non-strange baryons, strange quark matter in normal and superconducting phases, etc. We examine the universal relations for quantities moment of inertia - tidal love number - quadrupole moment. We also study the correlation of non-radial f-mode and p-mode frequencies with stellar properties. We find the f-mode frequency observes the universal relation with dimensionless tidal deformability but the p-mode frequency does not show a good correlation with stellar properties. The p-mode frequency is sensitive to the composition of the matter. We find that universal relation is also applicable for stars with exotic matter in the core of the star with several models of exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Baryon electric charge correlation as a magnetometer of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation between net baryon number and electric charge, $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$, can serve as a magnetometer of QCD. This is demonstrated by lattice QCD computations using the highly improved staggered quarks with physical pion mass of $M_\pi=135~$MeV on $N_\tau=8$ and 12 lattices. We find that $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$ along the transition line starts to increase rapidly with magnetic field strength $eB\gtrsim 2M_\pi^2$ and by a factor 2 at $eB\simeq 8M_\pi^2$. Furthermore, the ratio of electric charge chemical potential to baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$, shows significant dependence on the magnetic field strength and varies from the ratio of electric charge to baryon number in the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions. These results can provide baselines for effective theory and model studies, and both $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$ and $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ could be useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments as compared with corresponding results from the hadron resonance gas model.</description>

      <title>Observables from classical black hole scattering in Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity from worldline quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit. We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some analytical results using stationary phase approximation. Interestingly, we also show that the $\lambda_4 \varphi^4$ interaction vertex does not contribute to the radiation by showing that the integral has no non-zero finite value.</description>

      <title>Tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation and find that the bispectrum peaks in the squeezed configuration, which is different from that of gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations re-entering the horizon in the radiation-dominated era. Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during inflation from that generated after inflation.</description>
