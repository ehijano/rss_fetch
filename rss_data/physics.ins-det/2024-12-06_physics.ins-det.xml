      <title>Development of decay energy spectroscopy for radio impurity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of a decay energy spectroscopy (DES) method for the analysis of radioactive impurities using magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs). The DES system was designed to analyze radionuclides, such as Ra-226, Th-228, and their daughter nuclides, in materials like copper, commonly used in rare-event search experiments. We tested the DES system with a gold foil absorber measuring 20x20x0.05 mm^3, large enough to accommodate a significant drop of source solution. Using this large absorber and an MMC sensor, we conducted a long-term measurement over ten days of live time, requiring 11 ADR cooling cycles. The combined spectrum achieved an energy resolution of 45 keV FWHM, sufficient to identify most alpha and DES peaks of interest. Specific decay events from radionuclide contaminants in the absorber were identified. This experiment confirms the capability of the DES system to measure alpha decay chains of Ra-226 and Th-228, offering a promising method for radio-impurity evaluation in ultra-low background experiments.</description>

      <title>Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (BBCEAS) Coupled with an Interferometer for On-Band and Off-Band Detection of Glyoxal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glyoxal CHOCHO is a trace gas in the atmosphere, often used as an indicator of biogenic emissions. It is frequently compared to formaldehyde concentrations, which serve as indicators of anthropogenic emissions, to gain insights into the characteristics of the environmental source. This study employed broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy to detect gaseous CHOCHO, methylglyoxal, and $\mathrm{NO_2}$. Two different detection methods are compared. Spectrograph and CCD Detection: This approach involves coupling the system to a spectrograph with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. It achieved a 1 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limit of $2.5 \times 10^8$ molecules/cm$^3$, or 10 parts per trillion (ppt). Methylglyoxal and $\mathrm{NO_2}$ achieved 1 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limits of 34 ppt and 22 ppt, respectively. Interferometer and PMT Detection: In this method, an interferometer is used in conjunction with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. It resulted in a 2 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limit of $1.5 \times 10^{10}$ molecules/cm$^3$, or 600 ppt. The $\mathrm{NO_2}$ 2 min 1-$\sigma$ detection limit was determined to be 900 ppt. Concentrations of methylglyoxal were difficult to determine using this method, as they appeared to be below the detection limit of the instrument. This study discusses the advantages and limitations of each of these detection methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the properties of strongly-interacting matter at high relative baryon densities is one of the key scientific goals of the MPD (Multi-Purpose Detector) experiment at the NICA accelerator complex. The performance of measuring the azimuthal collective flow of identified charged hadrons at the MPD facility in fixed-target mode is studied in this work.</description>

      <title>Modification on thermal motion in Geant4 for neutron capture simulation in Gadolinium loaded water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron tagging is a fundamental technique for electron anti-neutrino detection via the inverse beta decay channel. A reported discrepancy in neutron detection efficiency between observational data and simulation predictions prompted an investigation into neutron capture modeling in Geant4. The study revealed that an overestimation of the thermal motion of hydrogen atoms in Geant4 impacts the fraction of captured nuclei. By manually modifying the Geant4 implementation, the simulation results align with calculations based on evaluated nuclear data and show good agreement with observables derived from the SK-Gd data.</description>

      <title>Studies of Cherenkov Photon Production in PbF$_2$ Crystals using Proton Beams at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future lepton colliders such as the FCC-ee, CEPC, ILC, or a muon collider will collect large data samples that allow precision physics studies with unprecedented accuracy, especially when the data is collected by innovative state-of-the-art detectors. An electromagnetic calorimeter based on scintillating crystals, designed to separately record Cherenkov and scintillation light, can achieve precision measurements of electrons and photons without sacrificing jet energy resolution, given adequate light collection efficiency and separation. This paper presents initial measurements from a program aimed at developing such a calorimeter system for future colliders. We focus on using PbF2 crystals to enhance the understanding of Cherenkov light collection, marking the first step in this endeavor.</description>

      <title>A Transition Edge Sensor Operated in Coincidence with a High Sensitivity Athermal Phonon Sensor for Photon Coupled Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental searches for axions or dark photons that couple to the standard model photon require photosensors with low noise, broadband sensitivity, and near zero backgrounds. Here, we introduce an experimental architecture, in which a small photon sensor, in our case a Transition Edge Sensor (TES) with a photon energy resolution $\sigma_\gamma = 368.4 \pm 0.4$ meV, is colocated on the same substrate as a large high sensitivity athermal phonon sensor (APS) with a phonon energy resolution $\sigma_\mathrm{phonon} = 701 \pm 2$ meV. We show that single 3.061 eV photons absorbed in the photon-sensing TES deposit $\sim$35\% of their energy in the electronic system of the TES, while $\sim$26\% of the photon energy leaks out of the photon-sensing TES during the downconversion process and becomes absorbed by the APS. Backgrounds, which we associate with the broadly observed ``low energy excess'' (LEE), are observed to be largely coupled to either the TES (``singles'' LEE), or phonon system, (``shared'' LEE). At high energies, these backgrounds can be efficiently discriminated from TES photon absorption events, while at low energies, their misidentification as photon events is well modeled. With significant sensitivity improvements to both the TES and APS, this coincidence technique could be used to suppress backgrounds in bosonic dark matter searches down to energies near the superconducting bandgap of the sensor.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and low-energy ionization signatures of relativistic particles in silicon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state detectors with a low energy threshold have several applications, including searches of non-relativistic halo dark-matter particles with sub-GeV masses. When searching for relativistic, beyond-the-Standard-Model particles with enhanced cross sections for small energy transfers, a small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we calculate the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We consider the full material response including the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, including collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and upscattered dark-matter particles. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.</description>
