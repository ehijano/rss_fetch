      <title>BioCube: A Multimodal Dataset for Biodiversity Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biodiversity research requires complete and detailed information to study ecosystem dynamics at different scales. Employing data-driven methods like Machine Learning is getting traction in ecology and more specific biodiversity, offering alternative modelling pathways. For these methods to deliver accurate results there is the need for large, curated and multimodal datasets that offer granular spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work, we introduce BioCube, a multimodal, fine-grained global dataset for ecology and biodiversity research. BioCube incorporates species observations through images, audio recordings and descriptions, environmental DNA, vegetation indices, agricultural, forest, land indicators, and high-resolution climate variables. All observations are geospatially aligned under the WGS84 geodetic system, spanning from 2000 to 2020. The dataset will become available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BioDT/BioCube while the acquisition and processing code base at https://github.com/BioDT/bfm-data.</description>

      <title>VenusX: Unlocking Fine-Grained Functional Understanding of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro, BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation for future research. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ai4protein/VenusX.</description>

      <title>Variational Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Single Network, Least Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering the dynamics from a few snapshots of a high-dimensional system is a challenging task in statistical physics and machine learning, with important applications in computational biology. Many algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem, based on frameworks such as optimal transport and the Schr\"odinger bridge. A notable recent framework is Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (RUOT), which integrates both stochastic dynamics and unnormalized distributions. However, since many existing methods do not explicitly enforce optimality conditions, their solutions often struggle to satisfy the principle of least action and meet challenges to converge in a stable and reliable way. To address these issues, we propose Variational RUOT (Var-RUOT), a new framework to solve the RUOT problem. By incorporating the optimal necessary conditions for the RUOT problem into both the parameterization of the search space and the loss function design, Var-RUOT only needs to learn a scalar field to solve the RUOT problem and can search for solutions with lower action. We also examined the challenge of selecting a growth penalty function in the widely used Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and proposed a solution that better aligns with biological priors in Var-RUOT. We validated the effectiveness of Var-RUOT on both simulated data and real single-cell datasets. Compared with existing algorithms, Var-RUOT can find solutions with lower action while exhibiting faster convergence and improved training stability.</description>

      <title>mCLM: A Function-Infused and Synthesis-Friendly Modular Chemical Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties. In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make in the lab. To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language. However, LLMs are currently limited by encoding molecules from atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks. By reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in block-based chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled manner. In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining drug potentials. More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and improve the FDA-rejected drugs (``fallen angels'') over multiple iterations to greatly improve their shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Active Learning on Synthons for Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exhaustive virtual screening is highly informative but often intractable against the expensive objective functions involved in modern drug discovery. This problem is exacerbated in combinatorial contexts such as multi-vector expansion, where molecular spaces can quickly become ultra-large. Here, we introduce Scalable Active Learning via Synthon Acquisition (SALSA): a simple algorithm applicable to multi-vector expansion which extends pool-based active learning to non-enumerable spaces by factoring modeling and acquisition over synthon or fragment choices. Through experiments on ligand- and structure-based objectives, we highlight SALSA's sample efficiency, and its ability to scale to spaces of trillions of compounds. Further, we demonstrate application toward multi-parameter objective design tasks on three protein targets - finding SALSA-generated molecules have comparable chemical property profiles to known bioactives, and exhibit greater diversity and higher scores over an industry-leading generative approach.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Sample-and Back-Focal-Plane (BFP) Imaging. Pt. I: Instrument and acquisition parameters affecting BFP images and their analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The back-focal plane (BFP) of a high-numerical aperture objective contains the fluoro-phore radiation pattern, which encodes information about the axial fluorophore position, molecular orientation and the local refractive index of the embedding medium. BFP image acquisition and analysis are common to conoscopy, k-space imaging, supercritical-angle fluorescence (SAF) and single-molecule detection, but they are rarely being used in biological fluorescence. This work addresses a critical gap in quantitative microscopy by enabling reliable, real-time BFP imaging under low-light conditions and/or short exposure times, typical of biological experiments. By systematically analyzing how key parameters - such as Bertrand lens position, defocus, pixel size, and binning - affect BFP image quality and SAF/UAF ratios, we provide a robust framework for accurate axial fluorophore localization and near-membrane refractive-index measurements. The described hardware- and software integration allows for multi-dimensional image-series and online quality control, reducing experimental error and enhancing reproducibility. Our contributions lay the foundation for standardized BFP imaging across laboratories, expanding its application to dynamic biological systems, and opening the door to machine learning-based analysis pipelines. Ultimately, this work transforms BFP imaging from an expert-dependent technique into a reproducible and scalable tool for surface-sensitive fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, \emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Driven Dynamical Model for Axonal Extension on Parallel Micropatterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.</description>

      <title>Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment, which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis. Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

      <title>A Simple Voltage-Modulated Markov Chain Model for the Piezo1 Ion Channel to Investigate Electromechanical Pacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piezo1 ion channels are voltage-modulated, stretch-activated ion channels involved in a variety of important physiological and pathophysiological processes, as for example cardiovascular development and homeostasis. Since its discovery, it has been known that this type of ion channel desensitizes when exposed to stretch. However, recent experiments on Piezo1 ion channels have uncovered that their stretch response is qualitatively different when exposed to positive electrochemical driving forces, where the desensitization is reset. In this work, we propose a novel voltage-modulated mathematical model of Piezo1 based on a continuous-time Markov chain. We show that our Piezo1 model is able to quantitatively reproduce a wide range of experimental observations. Furthermore, we integrate our new ion channel model into the Mahajan-Shiferaw ventricular cardiomyocyte model to study the effect of electromechanical pacing at the cellular scale. This integrated cell model is able to qualitatively reproduce some aspects of the experimental observations regarding the rate-dependence of electromechanical pacing protocols. Our studies suggest that the Piezo1 ion channel is an important component that significantly contributes to the electromechanical coupled response of cardiomyocytes.</description>

      <title>NaFM: Pre-training a Foundation Model for Small-Molecule Natural Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural products, as metabolites from microorganisms, animals, or plants, exhibit diverse biological activities, making them crucial for drug discovery. Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, mapping interactions between genes within cellular systems is a crucial early step. Such maps are not only foundational for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying disease biology but also pivotal for formulating hypotheses about potential targets for new medicines. Recognizing the need to elevate the construction of these gene-gene interaction networks, especially from large-scale, real-world datasets of perturbed single cells, the CausalBench Challenge was initiated. This challenge aimed to inspire the machine learning community to enhance state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing better utilization of expansive genetic perturbation data. Using the framework provided by the CausalBench benchmark, participants were tasked with refining the current methodologies or proposing new ones. This report provides an analysis and summary of the methods submitted during the challenge to give a partial image of the state of the art at the time of the challenge. Notably, the winning solutions significantly improved performance compared to previous baselines, establishing a new state of the art for this critical task in biology and medicine.</description>

Abstract: Clinical trials remain critical in cardiac drug development but face high failure rates due to efficacy limitations and safety risks, incurring substantial costs. In-silico trial methodologies, particularly generative models simulating drug-induced electrocardiogram (ECG) alterations, offer a potential solution to mitigate these challenges. While existing models show progress in ECG synthesis, their constrained fidelity and inability to characterize individual-specific pharmacological response patterns fundamentally limit clinical translatability. To address these issues, we propose a novel Drug-Aware Diffusion Model (DADM). Specifically, we construct a set of ordinary differential equations to provide external physical knowledge (EPK) of the realistic ECG morphology. The EPK is used to adaptively constrain the morphology of the generated ECGs through a dynamic cross-attention (DCA) mechanism. Furthermore, we propose an extension of ControlNet to incorporate demographic and drug data, simulating individual drug reactions. Compared to the other eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) ECG generative models: 1) Quantitative and expert evaluation demonstrate that DADM generates ECGs with superior fidelity; 2) Comparative results on two real-world databases covering 8 types of drug regimens verify that DADM can more accurately simulate drug-induced changes in ECGs, improving the accuracy by at least 5.79% and recall by 8%. In addition, the ECGs generated by DADM can also enhance model performance in downstream drug-effect classification tasks.</description>
