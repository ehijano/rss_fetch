      <title>The focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with power-type growth nonlinearities in the radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with a coupled system of focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations involving general power-type nonlinearities in the energy-critical setting for dimensions $3\leq d\leq 5$ in the radial setting. Our aim is to demonstrate the scattering versus blow-up dichotomy in the radial case. To achieve this, we first prove the existence of ground state solutions using the concentration-compactness method combined with variational techniques. We then establish finite-time blow-up through a convexity argument and prove scattering by applying the concentration-compactness and rigidity method.</description>

      <title>Global existence of weak solutions to a two-phase diffuse interface model of ferrofluids dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrofluids are a class of materials that exhibit both fluid and magnetic properties. We consider a two-phase diffuse interface model for the dynamics of ferrofluids on a bounded domain. One phase is assumed to be magnetic, the other phase can be magnetic or non-magnetic. We derive a coupled system of partial differential equations consisting of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, an evolution equation for the magnetization, the magnetostatics equations for the magnetic field and the Cahn-Hilliard equations for the evolution of the phase field variable, which are all coupled through various source terms and parameters. In contrast to similar models in the literature, the system in this work formally satisfies an energy balance which remains meaningful even in singular limits such as a limit of zero relaxation time. However, the formal derivation of this balance requires a delicate cancellation of several highly non-linear terms, making it challenging to ensure similar cancellations for approximating systems. Our first main result is to prove the existence of global weak solutions for our ferrofluid system based on a carefully constructed sequence of approximation steps. Additionally, we also study the relaxation towards the quasi-equilibrium, in which case the magnetization equation degenerates to a linear relation between the magnetic field and the magnetization. As our second main result, we prove the rigorous convergence to this limiting system.</description>

      <title>Unconditional wave decay in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Burq's logarithmic decay rate [Bur98] to general compactly supported scatterers in dimension two. The main novelty is using recent results on low-frequency expansions to remove the requirement that the spectrum be regular at zero. This allows us to include, among other examples, arbitrary smooth obstacles with variable boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solution of 3D ferrohydrodynamic equations with transport noise: Bloch-Torrey regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a stochastic ferrohydrodynamic system which describes the Bloch-Torrey regularization of the motion of an electrically conducting ferrofluids driven by transport noise filling a 3D bounded domain with a smooth boundary. We prove the global existence of a probabilistic weak solution of the stochastic system by making use of the combination of Galerkin method and compactness method. The system under study is basically a coupling of the Navier-Stokes equations with internal rotation, the Maxwell equations and the ferromagnetization equations. Thus, our result can be seen as a modest generalization of the existing results on the global existence of weak solutions of stochastic Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), Navier-Stokes and Bloch type equations on 3D bounded domain.</description>

      <title>From random matrices to systems of particles in interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of these expository notes is to give an introduction to random matrices for non-specialist of this topic focusing on the link between random matrices and systems of particles in interaction. We first recall some general results about the random matrix theory that create a link between random matrices and systems of particles through the knowledge of the law of the eigenvalues of certain random matrices models. We next focus on a continuous in time approach of random matrices called the Dyson Brownian motion. We detail some general methods to study the existence of system of particles in singular interaction and the existence of a mean field limit for these systems of particles. Finally, we present the main result of large deviations when studying the eigenvalues of random matrices. This method is based on the fact that the eigenvalues of certain models of random matrices can be viewed as log gases in dimension 1 or 2.</description>

      <title>Normalised solutions for $p$-Laplacian equations with $L^p$-supercritical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $N\ge 3$ and $2&lt;p&lt;N$, we find normalised solutions to the equation \begin{align*} -\Delta_p u+(1+V(x))|u|^{p-2}u+\lambda u&amp;=|u|^{q-2}u\qquad\text{in $\mathbb{R}^N$}\\ \|u\|_2&amp;=\rho \end{align*} in the mass supercritical and Sobolev subcritical case, that is $q\in(p\frac{N+2}{N},\frac{Np}{N-p})$, at least if $\rho&gt;0$ is small enough. The function $V\in L^{N/p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$, which plays the role of potential, is assumed to be non-positive and vanishing at infinity. Moreover, we will prove the compactness of the embedding of the space of radial functions $W^{1,p}_{rad}(\mathbb{R}^N)\subset L^q(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for $p\in(1,N)$ and $q\in(p\frac{N+2}{N},\frac{Np}{N-p})$.</description>

      <title>Long-time behaviour and bifurcation analysis of a two-species aggregation-diffusion system on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stationary states, including their existence and stability, in a class of nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations with linear diffusion and symmetric nonlocal interactions. For the scalar case, we extend previous results by showing that key model features, such as existence, regularity, bifurcation structure, and stability exchange, continue to hold under a mere bounded variation hypothesis. For the corresponding two-species system, we carry out a fully rigorous bifurcation analysis using the bifurcation theory of Crandall &amp; Rabinowitz. This framework allows us to classify all solution branches from homogeneous states, with particular attention given to those arising from the self-interaction strength and the cross-interaction strength, as well as the stability of the branch at a point of critical stability. The analysis relies on an equivalent classification of solutions through fixed points of a nonlinear map, followed by a careful derivation of Fr\'echet derivatives up to third order. An interesting application to cell-cell adhesion arises from our analysis, yielding stable segregation patterns that appear at the onset of cell sorting in a modelling regime where all interactions are purely attractive.</description>

Abstract: We present a method of solving partial differential equations on the $n$-dimensional unit sphere using methods based on the continuous wavelet transform derived from approximate identities. We give an explicit analytical solution to the Poisson equation and to the Helmholtz equations. For the first one and for some special values of the parameter in the latter one, we derive a closed formula for the generalized Green function.</description>

      <title>On a phenotype-structured phase-field model of nutrient-limited tumour growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field models of tumour growth have proved useful as theoretical tools to investigate cancer invasion. A key implicit assumption underlying mathematical models of this type which have so far been proposed, though, is that cells in the tumour are identical. This assumption ignores both the fact that cells in the same tumour may express different characteristics to different extents, exhibiting heterogeneous phenotypes, and the fact that cells may undergo phenotypic changes, with their characteristics evolving over time. To address such a limitation, in this paper we incorporate inter-cellular phenotypic heterogeneity and the evolution of cell phenotypes into the phase-field modelling framework. This is achieved by formulating a phenotype-structured phase-field model of nutrient-limited tumour growth. For this model, we first establish a well-posedness result under general assumptions on the model functions, which encompass a wide spectrum of biologically relevant scenarios. We then present a sample of numerical solutions to showcase key features of spatiotemporal and evolutionary cell dynamics predicted by the model. We conclude with a brief overview of modelling and analytical research perspectives.</description>

      <title>On least energy solutions for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with $K$-wise interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish existence and properties of minimal energy solutions for the weakly coupled system $$ \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_i + \lambda_i u_i = \mu_i|u_i|^{Kq-2}u_i + \beta|u_i|^{q-2}u_i\prod_{j\neq i}|u_j|^q &amp; \text{in }\mathbb{R}^d, \qquad
  u_i \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^d), \end{cases}\qquad i=1,\dots, K, $$ characterized by $K$-wise interaction (namely the interaction term involves the product of all the components). We consider both attractive ($\beta&gt;0$) and repulsive cases ($\beta&lt;0$), and we give sufficient conditions on $\beta$ in order to have least energy fully non-trivial solutions, if necessary under a radial constraint. We also study the asymptotic behavior of least energy fully non-trivial radial solutions in the limit of strong competition $\beta \to -\infty$, showing partial segregation phenomena which differ substantially from those arising in pairwise interaction models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weak solutions $(u,\pi):\mathbb{R}^n\supset\Omega\to\ \mathbb{R}^n\times\ \mathbb{R}$ to stationary $p$-Stokes systems of the type \[  \begin{cases} -\mathrm{div} (a(\mathcal{E} u))+\nabla\pi=f  \\ \mathrm{div}(u)=0, \end{cases} \] in $\Omega,$ where the function $a(\xi)$ satisfies $p$-growth conditions in $\xi$. By $\mathcal{E} u$ we denote the symmetric part of the gradient $Du$. In this setting, we establish results on the fractional higher differentiability of both the symmetric part of the gradient $ D u$ and of the pressure $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions with higher regularity to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in the half-plane under a slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global existence of weak solutions to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum in the half-plane under a slip boundary condition provided the bulk viscosity coefficient is properly large. In particular, the initial data can be arbitrarily large and the regularity of solutions is stronger than Lions-Feireisl's weak solutions with general finite-energy initial data. Our method relies on a Desjardins-type logarithmic interpolation inequality and some new techniques based on the effective viscous flux.</description>

      <title>Incompressible limit for the 3D compressible FENE dumbbell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the global-in-time incompressible limit of the compressible FENE dumbbell model on the three-dimensional torus T^3, where the incompressible limit is driven by large volume viscosity. To establish this limit, we develop time-weighted a priori estimates that yield decay rates for strong solutions. A key challenge arises from the fact that increasing the volume viscosity suppresses the decay of high-frequency components, thereby weakening the dissipation of the density and complicating the derivation of uniform-in-time decay estimates. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel momentum-based estimate and show that the incompressible component of the momentum decays faster in time than the velocity itself. Exploiting this enhanced decay, we successfully close the a priori estimates and establish a time-decreasing convergence rate toward the incompressible limit.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for stochastic porous media equations via regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a priori bounds for solutions of singular stochastic porous media equations with multiplicative noise in their natural $L^1$-based regularity class. We consider the first singular regime, i.e.~noise of space-time regularity $\alpha-2$ for $\alpha\in(2/3,1)$, and prove modelledness of the solution in the sense of regularity structures with respect to the solution of the corresponding linear stochastic heat equation. The proof relies on the kinetic formulation of the equation and a novel renormalized energy inequality. A careful analysis allows to balance the degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient against sufficiently strong damping of the multiplicative noise for small values of the solution.</description>

      <title>Steklov vs. Steklov: A Fourth-Order Affair Related to the Babu\v{s}ka Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss two fourth-order Steklov problems and highlight a Babu\v{s}ka paradox appearing in their approximations on convex domains via sequences of convex polygons. To do so, we prove that the eigenvalues of one of the two problems depend with continuity upon domain perturbation in the class of convex domains, extending a result known in the literature for the first eigenvalue. This is obtained by examining in detail a nonlocal, second-order problem for harmonic functions introduced by Ferrero, Gazzola, and Weth. We further review how this result is connected to diverse variants of the classical Babu\v{s}ka paradox for the hinged plate and to a degeneration result by Maz'ya and Nazarov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Navier--Stokes--Voigt system in the whole four-dimensional space is considered. Although we do not know any physical reasons to consider this system in space dimension four, the attractors theory for this case becomes especially simple and elegant and nothing similar happens when the space dimension is different than four. These notes are devoted to developing this theory, including well-posedness, dissipativity, existence of a global attractor and estimates for its dimension.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic self-similarity of the damped compressible Euler equations in parabolic scaling variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to the compressible Euler equations with frictional damping in the whole space, where we prescribe direction-dependent values for the density at spatial infinity. To this end, we transform the system into parabolic scaling variables and derive a relative entropy inequality, which allows to conclude the convergence of the density towards a self-similar solution to the porous medium equation while the associated limit momentum is governed by Darcy's law. Moreover, we obtain convergence rates that explicitly depend on the flatness of the limit profile. While we focus on weak solutions in the one-dimensional case, we extend our results to energy-variational solutions in the multi-dimensional setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a bounded domain of class $C^{2+\alpha}$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. We show that if $u$ is the maximal solution of $\Delta u = 4\exp(2u)$, which tends to $+\infty$ as $(x,y)\to\partial\Omega$, then the hyperbolic radius $v=\exp(-u)$ is of class $C^{2+\alpha}$ up to the boundary. The proof relies on new Schauder estimates for Fuchsian elliptic equations.</description>

      <title>Second order estimates for a free boundary phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that minimizers of the Allen-Cahn-type functional
  \[
  J_\epsilon(u):=\int_\Omega\frac{\epsilon|\nabla u|^2}{2}+\frac{W(u)}{\epsilon},
  \]
  where $W$ is a double-well potential, resemble minimal surfaces in the sense that their level sets converge to a minimal surface as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. In this work, we consider the indicator potential $W(t)=\chi_{(-1,1)}(t)$, which leads to the Bernoulli-type free-boundary problem
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  \Delta u=0&amp;\quad\textrm{ in }\{|u|&lt;1\}
  |\nabla u|=\epsilon^{-1}&amp;\textrm{ on }\partial \{|u|&lt;1\}.
  \end{cases}
  \]
  We provide a short proof that the transition layers are uniformly $C^{2,\alpha}$ regular, up to the free boundary. In addition to the uniform $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimate, we also obtain improved interior $C^\alpha$ mean curvature bound that decays in algebraic rate of $\epsilon$. We develop a framework to interpret the family of level surfaces as a geometric flow, where the notion of the time coincides with the level. This results in an simple elliptic equation for the surface velocity $\sigma=1/|\nabla u|$, from which uniform estimates readily follow.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of solutions of degenerate elliptic equations with lower order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a Dirichlet problem
  \[ \begin{cases} Lu = f + v^{-1}\text{Div}(v{\bf e} h), &amp; x \in \Omega;
  u = 0, &amp; x \in \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases}\]
  where $L$ is a degenerate, linear, second order elliptic operator with lower order terms. We assume very weak hypotheses, in terms of the coefficients of the equation, and we also assume the existence of degenerate Sobolev and Poincar\'e inequalities. One notable feature of our result is that we show that we can assume significantly weaker versions of the Sobolev inequality if we in turn assume stronger integrability conditions on the coefficients. Our theorems generalize a number of results in the literature on degenerate elliptic equations.</description>

      <title>On the Regularity of Navier-Stokes Equations in Critical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations in critical space. Let $ u(x,t) $ and $ p(x,t) $ denote suitable weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in $Q_T=\mathbb{R}^3\times(-T, 0)$. We prove that if $u(x,t)$ is in the scaling invariant spaces $L_t^{\infty}L_{x_3}^{p_1}L_{x_h}^{p_2}(Q_T)$ , where $ \frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{2}{p_2}=1 $ , $p_1\geq 2$ and $ x_h = (x_1, x_2) $ , then $ u $ is a smooth solution in $ Q_T $ and doesn't blow up at $ t = 0 $. In particular, if $ u(x,t) \in L_t^{\infty}L_{x_3}^{\infty}L_{x_h}^{2}(Q_T)$, then $u(x,t)$ is a smooth solution in $ Q_T $ and regular up to $ t = 0 $.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Euler-Poisson flows with nonzero vorticity in convergent nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns supersonic flows with nonzero vorticity governed by the steady Euler-Poisson system, under the coupled effects of the electric potential and the geometry of a convergent nozzle. By the coordinate rotation, the existence of radially symmetric supersonic flows is proved. We then establish the structural stability of these background supersonic flows under multi-dimensional perturbations of the boundary conditions. One of the crucial ingredients of the analysis is the reformulation of the steady Euler-Poisson system into a deformation-curl-Poisson system and several transport equations via the deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition. Another one is to obtain the well-posedness of the boundary value problem for the associated linearized hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system, which is achieved through a delicate choice of multiplier to derive a priori estimates. The result indicates that the electric field force in compressible flows can counteract the geometric effects of the convergent nozzle and thereby stabilize key physical features of the flow.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dissipation for the N-Dimensional elastic FENE dumbbell model near an equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-dimensional FENE dumbbell model without velocity dissipation, focusing on the stability and decay of perturbations near the steady solution $(0,\psi_\infty)$. Due to the lack of velocity dissipation, the above problems are highly challenging. In fact, without coupling, the corresponding $N$-dimensional Euler equation is well known to be unstable. To overcome this difficulty, we investigate two types of enhanced dissipation associated with the system governing the perturbations near this steady state, one due to the equilibrium and one due to the coupling and interaction. These enhanced dissipation mechanisms enable us to establish the global stability in the $H^s$-type Sobolev norms. Also, we highlight the critical role of enhanced dissipation in the decay estimates of the elastic FENE dumbbell model. By combining this property with the Fourier splitting method, we derive the decay rate which is identical to that of the general FENE dumbbell with velocity dissipation.</description>

Abstract: The asymptotic stability of the black and dark solitons of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation was proved by B\'ethuel, Gravejat and Smets (Ann. Sci. \'Ec. Norm. Sup\'er. 48 (2015)) and Gravejat and Smets (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. 111 (2015)), using a rigidity property in the vicinity of solitons. We provide an alternate proof of the Liouville theorems in the above articles using a factorization identity for the linearized operator which trivializes the spectral analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate bound states with prescribed angular momentum and mass for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (NLS) with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity in dimensions three. We demonstrate that there exist three solutions for the double constrained problem: a local minimizer, a mountain pass type solution, and a global minimizer. Moreover, by means of the minimax method, we construct a new mountain pass path and further obtain the geometric link among the three solutions as well as a comparison of their energy levels. This seems to be the first paper concerning three solutions, with the method also being applicable to the single constraint problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the two-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes equations between two infinite parallel isothermal walls, where the upper wall is moving with a horizontal velocity, while the lower wall is stationary, and there allows a temperature difference between the two walls. It is shown that if the initial state is close to the Couette flow with a temperature gradient, then the global strong solutions exist, provided that the Reynolds and Mach numbers are low and the temperature difference between the two walls is small. The low Mach number limit of the global strong solutions is also shown for the case that both walls maintain the same temperature.</description>

      <title>Regularity of velocity averages in kinetic equations with heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the regularity of kinetic equations with spatial heterogeneity. Recent progress has shown that velocity averages of weak solutions $h$ in $L^p$ ($p&gt;1$) are strongly $L^1_{\text{loc}}$ compact under the natural non-degeneracy condition. We establish regularity estimates for equations with an $\boldsymbol{x}$-dependent drift vector $\mathfrak{f} = \mathfrak{f}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{\lambda})$, which satisfies a quantitative version of the non-degeneracy condition. We prove that $(t,\boldsymbol{x}) \mapsto \int \rho(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) h(t,\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\lambda})\, d\boldsymbol{\lambda}$, for any sufficiently regular $\rho(\cdot)$, belongs to the fractional Sobolev space $W_{\text{loc}}^{\beta,r}$, for some regularity $\beta\in (0,1)$ and integrability $r \geq 1$ exponents. While such estimates have long been known for $\boldsymbol{x}$-independent drift vectors $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{f}(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$, this is the first quantitative regularity estimate in a general heterogeneous setting. As an application, we obtain a regularity estimate for entropy solutions to heterogeneous conservation laws with nonlinear flux and $L^\infty$ initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of ground state normalized solution of the following Schr\"{o}dinger equation: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u+V(x)u+\lambda u=f(x,u), &amp; x\in\mathbb{Z}^d \\ \Vert u\Vert_2^2=a \end{cases} \end{equation*}
  where $V(x)$ is trapping potential or well potential, $f(x,u)$ satisfies Berestycki-Lions type condition and other suitable conditions. We show that there always exists a threshold $\alpha\in[0,\infty)$ such that there do not exist ground state normalized solutions for $a\in (0,\alpha)$, and there exists a ground state normalized solution for $a\in(\alpha,\infty)$. Furthermore, we prove sufficient conditions for the positivity of $\alpha$ that $\alpha=0$ if $f(x,u)$ is mass-subcritical near 0, and $\alpha&gt;0$ if $f(x,u)$ is mass-critical or mass-supercritical near 0.</description>

Abstract: This article establishes the existence of weak solutions for a class of mixed local-nonlocal problems with pure and perturbed singular nonlinearities. A key novelty is the treatment of variable singular exponents alongside measure-valued data. Notably, both source terms may be measures, with the singular component modeled by both a singular and non-singular measure. Our main focus is on the singular measure data, which appears to be new, even for constant exponents.</description>

      <title>Fractional Infinity Laplacian with Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the obstacle problem for the fractional infinity Laplacian with nonhomogeneous term $f(u)$, where $f:\mathbb{R}^+ \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$: $$\begin{cases} L[u]=f(u) &amp;\qquad in \{u&gt;0\}\\ u \geq 0 &amp;\qquad in\, \Omega\\ u=g &amp;\qquad on\, \partial \Omega\end{cases},$$ with $$L[u](x)=\sup_{y\in \Omega,\,y\neq x}\dfrac{u(y)-u(x)}{|y-x|^{\alpha}}+\inf_{y\in \Omega,\,y\neq x} \dfrac{u(y)-u(x)}{|y-x|^\alpha},\qquad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1.$$ Under the assumptions that $f$ is a continuous and monotone function and that the boundary datum $g$ is in $C^{0,\beta}(\partial\Omega)$ for some $0&lt;\beta&lt;\alpha$, we prove existence of a solution $u$ to this problem. Moreover, this solution $u$ is $\beta-$H\"olderian on $\overline{\Omega}$. Our proof is based on an approximation of $f$ by an appropriate sequence of functions $f_\varepsilon$ where we prove using Perron's method the existence of solutions $u_\varepsilon$, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Then, we show some uniform H\"older estimates on $u_\varepsilon$ that guarantee that $u_\varepsilon \rightarrow u$ where this limit function $u$ turns out to be a solution to our obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Local/global well-posedness analysis of time-space fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the $\phi(-\Delta)$-type operator studied by Kim \cite[\emph{Adv. Math.}]{Kim2}, where $\phi$ is the Bernstein function, this paper investigates a class of nonlinear time-space fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations that exhibit nonlocal effects in both time and space. The time part is derived from the model proposed by Narahari Achar, and the space part is a $\phi(-\Delta)$-type operator. Due to nonlocal effects, this invalidates the classical Strichartz estimate. Combining the asymptotic behavior of Mittag-Leffler functions, H\"{o}rmander multiplier theory and other methods of harmonic analysis, we establish the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality in the $\phi$-Triebel-Lizorkin space studied by Mikulevi\v{c}ius \cite[\emph{Potential Anal.}]{Mikulevicius} and obtain some Sobolev estimates for the solution operator, thus establishing the global/local well-posedness of the equations in some Banach space. In particular, our results are complementary to those of Su \cite[\emph{J. Math. Anal. Appl.}]{Su}, and the methods are quite different.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of the principal eigenvalue of elliptic operators for large advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limit of the principal eigenvalue $\lambda(s)$ as $s\to+\infty$ for the following elliptic equation
  \begin{align*} -\Delta\varphi(x)-2s\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\varphi(x)+c(x)\varphi(x)=\lambda(s)\varphi(x), \quad x\in \Omega
  \end{align*} in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d (d\geq 1)$ with the Neumann boundary condition. Previous studies have shown that under certain conditions on $\mathbf{v}$, $\lambda(s)$ converges as $s\to\infty$ (including cases where $\lim\limits_{s \to\infty }\lambda(s)=\pm\infty$). This work constructs an example such that $\lambda(s)$ is divergent as $s\to+\infty$. This seems to be the first rigorous result demonstrating the non-convergence of the principal eigenvalue for second-order linear elliptic operators with some strong advection. As an application, we demonstrate that for the classical advection-reaction-diffusion model with advective velocity field $\mathbf{v}=\nabla m$, where $m$ is a potential function with infinite oscillations, the principal eigenvalue changes sign infinitely often along a subsequence of $s\to\infty$. This leads to solution behaviors that differ significantly from those observed when $m$ is non-oscillatory.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of time-space fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the well-posedness of a class of time-space fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations introduced by Naber. In contrast to the classical Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the solution operator here exhibits derivative loss and lacks the structure of a semigroup, which makes the classical Strichartz estimates inapplicable. By using harmonic analysis tools -- including the smoothing effect theory of Kenig and Ponce for Korteweg-de Vries equations \cite[\emph{Commun.~Pure Appl.~Math.}]{Kenig}, real interpolation techniques, and the Van der Corput lemma -- we establish novel dispersive estimates for the solution operator. These estimates generalize Ponce's regularity results \cite[\emph{J.~Funct.~Anal.}]{Ponce} for oscillatory integrals and enable us to address the derivative loss in the Schr\"{o}dinger kernel. For the cases $\beta&lt;2$~(in one space dimension) and $\beta&gt;2$~(in higher dimensions), we prove local and global well-posedness in Sobolev and Lorentz-type spaces, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of solutions and demonstrate the existence of self-similar solutions under homogeneous initial data. The results highlight the interplay between fractional derivatives, dispersive properties, and nonlinear dynamics, extending the understanding of nonlocal evolution equations in quantum mechanics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Characterising buried objects in metal detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current mathematical models for identifying highly conducting buried objects in metal detection assume that the soil is non-conducting and has the same permeability as free space. However, although the electrical conductivity of soil is low, it is not negligible and depends on factors such as soil type and salinity. Moreover, the magnetic permeability of soil varies with its iron content and is often described as uncooperative. Depending on the ground conditions, these soil's properties can influence the induced voltages in the measurement coils of metal detectors and becomes of increasing importance as the frequency of the exciting current source is increased. In this work, we develop a new asymptotic expansion for the perturbed magnetic field due to the presence of a highly conducting magnetic buried object as its size tends to zero, which takes account of the ground conditions. The leading order term of this expansion can be expressed in terms of a complex symmetric rank-2 magnetic polarizability tensor, which characterises the object, can assist in its identification, and we provide conditions under which this tensor's coefficients can be computed independently of the ground conditions. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of our new result, which takes account of the ground conditions, over the situation where the soil's conductivity and permeability are not considered.</description>

      <title>Non-radial minimizers for Hardy--Sobolev inequalities in non-convex cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry breaking is obtained for Neumann problems driven by $p$-Laplacian in certain non-convex cones. These problems are generated by the Hardy--Sobolev inequalities. In the case of the Sobolev inequality for the ordinary Laplacian this problem was investigated in (Ciraolo, Pacella, Polvara, 2024).
  Such problems have obvious radial solutions -- Talenti--Bliss type functions of $|x|$. However, under a certain restriction on the first Neumann eigenvalue $\lambda_1(D)$ of the Beltrami--Laplace operator on the spherical cross-section $D$ of the cone we prove this radial solution cannot be an extremal function, therefore minimizer must be non-radial. This leads to multiple solutions for the corresponding Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions to a large class of elliptic equations on bounded domains with general boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by adapting the perturbation method, we study the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
  $$
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u = \lambda u + f(u)\quad &amp; \text{in } \Omega,
  \mathcal{B}_{\alpha,\zeta,\gamma}u = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial \Omega,
  \int_{\Omega} |u|^2\,dx = \mu,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \leqno{(P)^\mu_{\alpha,\zeta,\gamma}}
  $$
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N \geq 1$) is a smooth bounded domain, $\mu&gt;0$ is prescribed, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is a part of the unknown which appears as a Lagrange multiplier, $f,g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions satisfying some technical conditions. The boundary operator $\mathcal{B}_{\alpha,\zeta,\gamma}$ is defined by
  $$
  \mathcal{B}_{\alpha,\zeta,\gamma}u=\alpha u+\zeta \frac{\partial u}{\partial \eta }-\gamma g(u),
  $$ where $\alpha,\zeta,\gamma \in \{0,1\}$ and $\eta$ denotes the outward unit normal on $\partial\Omega$. Moreover, we highlight several further applications of our approach, including the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with critical exponential growth in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with magnetic fields, the biharmonic equations, and the Choquard equations, among others.</description>

      <title>Multi-vortices and lower bounds on the attractor dimensions for 2D Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a principally new method, which is not based on the Kolmogorov flows, for obtaining the lower bounds for the attractors dimensions of the equations related with hydrodynamics and apply it to the classical 2D Navier--Stokes equations in a bounded domain as well as for the Navier--Stokes equations with Ekman damping in the whole plane. In the case of bounded domains, we give the lower bounds, which are similar to the well-known estimate on a torus and sphere and in the case of the whole plane our estimate is sharp. Note that no lower bounds for these two cases were known before. \par We suggest to use the so-called multi-vortex, which consists of a well-separated Vishik vortices (i.e., spectrally unstable localized in space flows constructed by M.M. Vishik), as the analogue of the Kolmogorov flows. Note also that this method reproduces the known result on the torus and that it is applicable to many other equations of hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Perimeter on a manifold, with applications to partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perimeter of a measurable subset of $\mathbb R^N$ is the total variation of its characteristic function. We generalize this notion to a subset $E$ of a closed Riemannian manifold. We show that the perimeter of $E$ is the limit of the hear kernel regularization of its characteristic function. A generalization of the isoperimetric inequality and of the Fleming-Rishel formula follow. These results are applied to a quasilinear elliptic problem in $\mathbb R^N$ for which the usual symmetrization methods fail. It will be tackled successfully by introducing a symmetrization method on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Global strong solution of the 3D compressible liquid crystal flows with density-dependent viscosity and large velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the Cauchy problem of three-dimensional compressible liquid crystal flows with density-dependent viscosity. When the viscosity coefficients $\mu_1(\rho),\mu_2(\rho)$ are power functions of the density with the power larger than $1$, it is proved that the system exists a unique global strong solution as long as the initial density is sufficiently large and $L^3$-norm of the derivative of the initial director is sufficiently small. This is the first result concerning the global strong solution for three-dimensional compressible liquid crystal flows without smallness of velocity.</description>

      <title>Direct reconstruction of general elastic inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse problem of linear elasticity is to determine the Lam\'e parameters, which characterize the mechanical properties of a domain, from pairs of pressure activations and the resulting displacements on its boundary. This work considers the specific problem of reconstructing inclusions that manifest themselves as deviations from the background Lam\'e parameters.
  The monotonicity method is a direct reconstruction method that has previously been considered for domains only containing positive (or negative) inclusions with finite contrast. That is, all inclusions have previously been assumed to correspond to a finite increase (or decrease) in both Lam\'e parameters compared to their background values. We prove the general outer approach of the monotonicity method that simultaneously allows positive and negative inclusions, of both finite and extreme contrast; the latter refers to either infinitely stiff or perfectly elastic materials.</description>

Our approach is variational, and our proof is based on a symmetric variant of the Mountain Pass theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the irregular double-phase evolution equation \[ u_t-\operatorname{div} \left( a(z)|\nabla u|^{p(z)-2} \nabla u + b(z)|\nabla u|^{q(z)-2} \nabla u\right)=f(z),\quad z=(x,t)\in Q_T:=\Omega\times (0,T),
  \] where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$, $N \geq 2$ is a bounded domain, $T&gt;0$, The non-differentiable coefficients $a(z)$, $b(z)$, the free term $f$, and the variable exponents $p$, $q$ are given functions. The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative, bounded, satisfy the inequality \[ a(z)+b(z)\geq \alpha \quad \text{in} \ Q_T, \quad \text{and} \quad |\nabla a|, |\nabla b|, a_t, b_t \in L^d(Q_T) \] for some constant $\alpha&gt;0$, and with $d&gt;2$ depending on $\sup p(z)$, $\sup q(z)$, $N$, and the regularity of initial data $u(x,0)$. The free term $f$ and initial data $u(x,0)$ satisfy \[ f\in L^\sigma(Q_T) \ \text{with} \ \sigma&gt;2 \quad \text{and} \quad |\nabla u(x,0)|\in L^{r}(\Omega) \ \text{with} \ r\geq \max \bigg\{2,\sup_{Q_T}p(z),\sup_{Q_T}q(z)\bigg\}. \] The variable exponents $p,q \in C^{0,1}(\overline{Q}_T)$ satisfy the balance condition \[ \frac{2N}{N+2} &lt; p(z), q(z)&lt; +\infty \ \text{in} \ \overline Q_T \quad \text{and} \quad \max\limits_{\overline Q_T}|p(z)-q(z)|&lt; \dfrac{2}{N+2}. \] Under the above assumptions, we establish the existence of a solution, which is obtained as the limit of classical solutions to a family of regularized problems and preserves initial temporal integrability: \[
  |\nabla u(\cdot, t)| \in L^r(\Omega) \ \text{for a.e.} \ t \in (0,T), \] gains global higher integrability: \[ |\nabla u|^{\min\{p(z), q(z)\} + s +r} \in L^1(Q_T) \ \text{for any} \ s \in \left(0, \frac{4}{N+2}\right), \] and attains second-order regularity: \[ a(z) |\nabla u|^{\frac{p+r-2}{2}}+b(z) |\nabla u|^{\frac{q+r-2}{2}}\in L^2(0,T;W^{1,2}(\Omega)). \]</description>

      <title>Notes on $L^2$-estimates in linear elliptic equations with general coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an explicit $L^2$-estimate for weak solutions $u$ to linear elliptic equations in divergence form with general coefficients and external source term $f$, stating that the $L^2$-norm of $u$ over $U$ is bounded by a constant multiple of the $L^2$-norm of $f$ over $U$. In contrast to classical approaches based on compactness arguments, the proposed method, which employs a divergence-free transformation method, provides a computable and explicit constant $C&gt;0$. The $L^2$-estimate remains robust even when there is no zero-order term, and the analysis further demonstrates that the constant $C&gt;0$ decreases as the diffusion coefficient or the zero-order term increases. These quantitative results provide a rigorous foundation for applications such as a posteriori error estimates in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), where explicit error bounds are essential.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy Problem for Symmetric Hyperbolic Systems with Nonlocal Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the initial value problem for symmetric hyperbolic systems on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds with potentials that are both nonlocal in time and space. When the potential is retarded and uniformly bounded in time, we establish well-posedness of the Cauchy problem on a time strip, proving existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions. If the potential is not retarded but has only short time range, we show that strong solutions still exist, under the additional assumptions that the uniform bound in time is sufficiently small compared to the range in time and that its kernel decays sufficiently fast in time with respect to the zero-order terms of the system. Furthermore, we present a counterexample demonstrating that when the uniform bound is too large compared to the time range, solutions may fail to exist. As an application, we discuss Maxwell's equations in linear dispersive media on ultrastatic spacetimes, as well as the Dirac equation with nonlocal potential naturally arising in the theory of causal fermion systems. Our paper aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study for the Cauchy problem for the semiclassical Einstein equations.</description>

      <title>The Landau equation and Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository note (submitted to Notices of the AMS) we present the ideas used in our recent work ruling out blow up for the Landau equation with Coulomb potential. Blow up is ruled out by the discovery that the Fisher information is not increasing in time along a solution. This monotonicity is established by means of a new ``lifted equation'' which is an auxiliary linear equation in double the number of variables that encodes the nonlinear nonlocal collision operator. For the Landau equation in particular this lifted equation amounts to a family of heat equations over the sphere. Some background on kinetic equations and the Fisher information, and connections to Bakry-Emery theory is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A PINNs approach for the computation of eigenvalues in elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for computing eigenvalues of elliptic problems using Deep Learning techniques. A key feature of our approach is that it is independent of the space dimension and can compute arbitrary eigenvalues without requiring the prior computation of lower ones. Moreover, the method can be easily adapted to handle nonlinear eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>On the non-convexity issue in the radial Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It is generally believed that it leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is riddled with bad local minimums. This has motivated the development of reconstruction methods based on convex optimization, one recent contribution being the nonlinear convex semidefinite programming approach of Harrach (2023). In this work, we investigate the computational viability of this convex approach in a simple setting where the conductivities are piecewise constant and radial. We implement this convex reconstruction method and compare it extensively to the least squares approach. Our experiments suggest that this convex programming approach only allows to accurately estimate the unknown for problems with a very small size. Moreover, surprisingly, it is consistently outperformed by Newton-type least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements. We revisit the issue of nonconvexity in this piecewise constant radial setting and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no local minimums in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption.</description>

      <title>Carnot-Carath\'eodory Balls on Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nagel, Stein, and Wainger introduced a detailed quantitative study of Carnot--Carath\'eodory balls on a smooth manifold without boundary. Most importantly, they introduced scaling maps adapted to Carnot--Carath\'eodory balls and H\"ormander vector fields. Their work was extended by many authors and has since become a key tool in the study of the interior theory of subelliptic PDEs; in particular, the study of maximally subelliptic PDEs. We introduce a generalization of this quantitative theory to manifolds with boundary, where we have scaling maps both on the interior and on the part of the boundary which is non-characteristic with respect to the vector fields. This is the first paper in a forthcoming series devoted to studying maximally subelliptic boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>Hilbert manifold structures on path spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Floer theory one has to deal with two-level manifolds like for instance the space of $W^{2,2}$ loops and the space of $W^{1,2}$ loops. Gradient flow lines in Floer theory are then trajectories in a two-level manifold. Inspired by our endeavor to find a general setup to construct Floer homology we therefore address in this paper the question if the space of paths on a two-level manifold has itself the structure of a Hilbert manifold. In view of the two topologies on a two-level manifold it is unclear how to define the exponential map on a general two-level manifold. We therefore study a different approach how to define charts on path spaces of two-level manifolds. To make this approach work we need an additional structure on a two-level manifold which we refer to as tameness. We introduce the notion of tame maps and show that the composition of tame is tame again. Therefore it makes sense to introduce the notion of a tame two-level manifold. The main result of this paper shows that the path spaces on tame two-level manifolds have the structure of a Hilbert manifold.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and stability analysis of a third-order multiclass traffic flow model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic flow modeling spans a wide range of mathematical approaches, from microscopic descriptions of individual vehicle dynamics to macroscopic models based on aggregate quantities. A fundamental challenge in macroscopic modeling lies in the closure relations, particularly in the specification of a traffic hesitation function in second-order models like Aw-Rascle-Zhang. In this work, we propose a third-order hyperbolic traffic model in which the hesitation evolves as a driver-dependent dynamic quantity. Starting from a microscopic formulation, we relax the standard assumption by introducing an evolution law for the hesitation. This extension allows to incorporate hysteresis effects, modeling the fact that drivers respond differently when accelerating or decelerating, even under identical local traffic conditions. Furthermore, various relaxation terms are introduced. These allow us to establish relations to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model and other traffic flow models.</description>

      <title>An explicit formulation of the learned noise predictor $\epsilon_{\theta}({\bf x}_t, t)$ via the forward-process noise $\epsilon_{t}$ in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law on Lipschitz domains, which appears to be the first quantitative estimate for the remainder of Weyl's law since Weyl's seminal work in the year 1911. We also provide in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, a class of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Kernels of trace operators via fine continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study traces of elements of fractional Sobolev spaces $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ on closed subsets $\Gamma$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, given as the supports of suitable measures $\mu$. We prove that if these measures satisfy localized upper density conditions, then quasi continuous representatives vanish quasi everywhere on $\Gamma$ if and only if they vanish $\mu$-almost everywhere on $\Gamma$. We use this result to characterize the kernel of the trace operator mapping from $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into the space of $\mu$-equivalence classes of functions on $\Gamma$ as the closure of $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \Gamma)$ in $H_p^\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)$. The measures do not have to satisfy a doubling condition. In particular, the set $\Gamma$ may be a finite union of closed sets having different Hausdorff dimensions. We provide corresponding results for fractional Sobolev spaces $H_p^\alpha(\Omega)$ on domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying the measure density condition.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we investigate the effects of metric perturbations of closed surfaces on the number of nodal domains. In particular, we show that the nodal domain count for Laplace eigenfunctions is (locally) maximised for non-generic metrics. We also investigate localised perturbations and showcase some interesting applications regarding Courant sharp metrics on closed surfaces and associated boundary nodal-data prescription problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to unifying the framework used to derive the Wiener--Hopf equations arising from some discrete and continuous wave diffraction problems.The main tools are the discrete Green's identity and the appropriate notion of discrete normal derivative. The resulting formal analogy between the Wiener--Hopf equations allows one to effortlessly move between the discrete and continuous formulations. The validity of this novel analogy is illustrated through several famous two-dimensional canonical diffraction problems and extended to three-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Transport for Discrete Multi-Dimensional Schr\"odinger Operators With Decaying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with a decaying potential, in arbitrary lattice dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}^*$, where $\Delta$ is the standard discrete Laplacian and $V_n = o(|n|^{-1})$ as $|n| \to \infty$. We prove that the unitary evolution $e^{-i tH}$ exhibits ballistic transport in the sense that, for any $r &gt; 0$, the weighted $\ell^2-$norm $$\|e^{-i tH}u\|_r:=\left(\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d} (1+|n|^2)^{r} |(e^{-i tH}u)_n|^2\right)^\frac12 $$ grows at rate $\simeq t^r$ as $t\to \infty$, provided that the initial state $u$ is in the absolutely continuous subspace and satisfies $\|u\|_r&lt;\infty$.
  The proof relies on commutator methods and a refined Mourre estimate, which yields quantitative lower bounds on transport for operators with purely absolutely continuous spectrum over appropriate spectral intervals. Compactness arguments and localized spectral projections are used to extend the result to perturbed operators, extending the classical result for the free Laplacian to a broader class of decaying potentials.</description>

      <title>On a parabolic curvature lower bound generalizing Ricci flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport plays a major role in the study of manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below. Some results in this setting have been extended to super Ricci flows, revealing a unified approach to analysis on Ricci nonnegative manifolds and Ricci flows. However we observe that the monotonicity of Perelman's functionals ($\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{W}$, reduced volume), which hold true for Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, cannot be strictly generalized to super Ricci flows. In 2010 Buzano introduced a condition which still generalizes Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, and on which Perelman's monotonicities do hold. We provide characterizations of this condition using optimal transport and understand it heuristically as Ricci nonnegativity of the space-time. This interpretation is consistent with its equivalence to Ricci nonnegativity on Perelman's infinite dimensional manifold.
  More precisely, we prove that for smooth evolutions of Riemannian manifolds, this condition is equivalent to a Bochner inequality (resembling Perelman's Harnack inequality but for the forward heat flow), a gradient estimate for the heat flow, a Wasserstein contraction along the adjoint heat flow, the convexity of a modified entropy along Wasserstein geodesics, and an Evolutionary Variational Inequality (EVI). The optimal transport statements use Perelman's $L$ distance as cost, as first studied on Ricci flows by Topping and by Lott. We also consider dimensionally improved and weighted versions of these conditions. The dimensional Bochner inequality and all gradient estimates for the forward heat equation, along with the EVIs, appear to be new even for general Ricci flows, and are related to the Hamiltonian perspective on the $L$ distance. Most of our proofs do not use tensor calculus or Jacobi fields, suggesting the possibility of future extensions to more singular settings.</description>

Abstract: We introduce three biharmonic Steklov problems on differential forms with Neumann boundary conditions and show that they are elliptic. We prove the existence of a discrete spectrum for each of those problems and give associated variational characterizations for their eigenvalues. We establish eigenvalue estimates known as Kuttler-Sigillito inequalities, relating the eigenvalues of these problems with the eigenvalues of the Steklov, Dirichlet and Neumann standard problems as well as the biharmonic Steklov problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on differential forms.</description>

      <title>One sided orthogonal polynomials and a pointwise convergence result for $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on a connection between the $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series and sequences of left and right orthogonal polynomials for complex measures on the unit circle. We show a convergence result for the associated reproducing kernel. This is a universality type result in the vein of Mate-Nevai-Totik, which turns out to be much simpler in the $SU(2)$ case than in the $SU(1,1)$ case. We then relate a.e. pointwise convergence of the product of left and right polynomials and their squares with both behavior of their zeros as well as behavior of some local parameters for these polynomials. We conclude by proving almost everywhere convergence along lacunary sequences of the functional $(a_n ^* +b_n)(a_n - b_n ^*)$ of the partial $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series $(a_n, b_n)$ under the assumption that the nonlinear Fourier series $(a,b)$ itself satisfies both $\|b\|_{L^{\infty} (\mathbb{T})} &lt; 2^{- \frac 1 2}$ and $a^*$ is outer.</description>

      <title>Lojasiewicz inequalities for almost harmonic maps near simple bubble trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.05527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Lojasiewicz inequalities for the harmonic map energy for maps from surfaces of positive genus into general analytic target manifolds which are close to simple bubble trees and as a consequence obtain new results on the convergence of harmonic map flow and on the energy spectrum of harmonic maps with small energy.
  Our results and techniques are not restricted to particular targets or to integrable settings and we are able to lift general Lojasiewicz-Simon inequalities valid near harmonic maps $\hat \omega:S^2\to N$ to the singular setting whenever the bubble $\hat \omega$ is attached at a point which is not a branch point.</description>

      <title>Variational convergence for an irreversible exchange-driven stochastic particle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the variational convergence of an irreversible Markov jump process describing a finite stochastic particle system to the solution of a countable infinite system of deterministic time-inhomogeneous quadratic differential equations known as the exchange-driven growth model, which has two conserved quantities. As a bounded perturbation of the reversible kernel, the variational formulation is a generalization of the gradient flow formulation of the reversible process and can be interpreted as the large deviation functional of the Markov jump process. As a consequence of the variational convergence result, we show the propagation of chaos of the Markov processes to the limiting equation and the $\Gamma$-convergence of the energy functional. The latter convergence is consistent with related results for reversible coagulation-fragmentation equations and reveals the connection of stochastic processes to the long-time condensation phenomena in the limit equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal global $BV$ regularity for 1-Laplace type BVP's with singular lower order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a complete characterization of the regularity properties of the solutions associated to the homogeneous Dirichlet problem \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle - \Delta_1 u= h(u)f &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\ \newline
  u=0 &amp; \text{on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary, $f \in L^m(\Omega)$ with $m\geq 1$ is a nonnegative function and $h\colon \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{R}^+$ is continuous, possibly singular at the origin and bounded at infinity.
  Without any growth restrictions on $h$ at zero, we prove existence of global finite energy solutions in $BV(\Omega)$ under sharp conditions on the summability of $f$ and on the behaviour of $h$ at infinity. Roughly speaking, the faster $h$ goes to zero at infinity, the less regularity is required on $f$. In contrast to the $p$-Laplacian case ($p&gt;1$), we show that the behaviour of $h$ at the origin plays essentially no role.
  The main result contains an extension of the celebrated one of Lazer-McKenna (\cite{lm}) to the case of the $1$-Laplacian as principal operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to construct non-trivial steady-state weak solutions of the three dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics equations in the class of $H^s(\mathbb T^3)$ for some small $s &gt; 0$. By exploiting the formulation of the stationary EMHD equations one can treat them as generalized Navier-Stokes equations with half Laplacian. Therefore with convex integration scheme we obtained such stationary weak solutions, which is not yet realizable in the case of classical 3D Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

Abstract: The infinitesimal forms of the $L_{p}$-Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for variational functionals, such as the $q$-capacity, the torsional rigidity, and the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator, are investigated for $p \geq 0$. These formulations yield Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities related to these functionals. As an application, the $L_{p}$-Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for torsional rigidity with $0 \leq p &lt; 1$ are confirmed for small $C^{2}$-perturbations of the unit ball.</description>

      <title>Multi-component phase separation and small deformations of a spherical biomembrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the derivation and analysis of a model for multi-component phase separation occurring on biological membranes, inspired by observations of lipid raft formation. The model integrates local membrane composition with local membrane curvature, describing the membrane's geometry through a perturbation method represented as a graph over an undeformed Helfrich minimising surface, such as a sphere. The resulting energy consists of a small deformation functional coupled to a Cahn-Hilliard functional. By applying Onsager's variational principle, we obtain a multi-component Cahn-Hilliard equation for the vector $\boldsymbol\varphi$ of protein concentrations coupled to an evolution equation for the small deformation $u$ along the normal direction to the reference membrane. Then, in the case of a constant mobility matrix, we consider the Cauchy problem and we prove that it is (globally) well posed in a weak setting. We also demonstrate that any weak solution regularises in finite time and satisfies the so-called "strict separation property". This property allows usto show that any weak solution converges to a single stationary state by a suitable version of the Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet Problem For the Logarithmic p-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian $L_{\Delta_p}$, which emerges from the formal derivative of the fractional $p$-Laplacian $(-\Delta_p)^s$ at $s=0$. This operator is nonlocal, has logarithmic order, and is the nonlinear version of the newly developed logarithmic Laplacian operator. We present a variational framework to study the Dirichlet problems involving the $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains. This allows us to investigate the connection between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the fractional $p$-Laplacian and the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian. As a consequence, we deduce a Faber-Krahn inequality for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. We discuss maximum and comparison principles for $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains and demonstrate that the validity of these depends on the sign of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. In addition, we prove that the first Dirichlet eigenfunction of $L_{\Delta_p}$ is bounded. Furthermore, we establish a boundary Hardy-type inequality for the spaces associated with the weak formulation of the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: We study the advection equation along vector fields singular at the initial time. More precisely, we prove that for divergence-free vector fields in $L^1_{loc}((0, T ]; BV (\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^2((0, T ) \times\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d)$, there exists a unique vanishing diffusivity solution. This class includes the vector field constructed by Depauw, for which there are infinitely many distinct bounded solutions to the advection equation.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is no relaxation gap between a quasi-dissipative nonlinear evolution equation in a Hilbert space and its linear Liouville equation reformulation on probability measures. In other words, strong and generalized solutions of such equations are unique in the class of measure-valued solutions. As a major consequence, non-convex numerical optimization over these non-linear partial differential equations can be carried out with the infinite-dimensional moment-SOS hierarchy with global convergence guarantees. This covers in particular all reaction-diffusion equations with polynomial nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Existence and orbital stability of standing-wave solutions of the NLS-log equation on a tadpole graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to study some dynamical aspects of the nonlinear logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation (NLS-log) on a tadpole graph, namely, a graph consisting of a circle with a half-line attached at a single vertex. By considering Neumann-Kirchhoff boundary conditions at the junction we show the existence and the orbital stability of standing wave solutions with a profile determined by a positive single-lobe state. Via a splitting-eigenvalue method, we identify the Morse index and the nullity index of a specific linearized operator around a positive singlelobe state. To our knowledge, the results contained in this paper are the first to study the (NLS-log) on tadpole graphs. In particular, our approach has the prospect of being extended to study stability properties of other bound states for the (NLS-log) on a tadpole graph or other non-compact metric graph such as a looping-edge graphs.</description>

We prove that for a small gap $q-p$, a solution is locally or globally Lipschitz continuous. We also prove that a given H\"older continuous solution is Lipschitz continuous under improved bounds for the gap. These gap conditions are similar to those required for the regularity of double phase problems in divergence form.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of compactly supported solutions of the inviscid incompressible 2D Boussinesq equation with $C^{1,\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}-1-\varepsilon}\cap L^{2}$ force that develop a singularity in finite time. Importantly, the force preserves this regularity at the blow-up time. Moreover, the forces in the vorticity and density equations have compact support. The mechanism behind the blow-up is an accumulated hysteresis effect on the vorticity caused by an infinite chain of "degenerate" pendula and flickering density.</description>

Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we revisit the observability of the Schr\"odinger equation on the two-dimensional torus. In contrast to the Schr\"odinger operator with a purely electric potential, for which any non-empty open set guarantees observability, the presence of a magnetic potential introduces an additional obstruction. We establish a sufficient and almost necessary geometric condition for the observability of electromagnetic Schr\"odinger operators. This condition incorporates the magnetic potential, which can also be characterized by a geometric control condition for the corresponding magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Infinite concentration and oscillation estimates for supercritical semilinear elliptic equations in discs. I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our series of papers, we establish infinite concentration and oscillation estimates for supercritical semilinear elliptic equations in discs. Especially, we extend the previous result by the author (N. arXiv:2404.01634) to the general supercritical case. Our growth condition is related to the one introduced by Dupaigne-Farina (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 12: 855--882, 2010) and admits two types of supercritical nonlinearities, the Trudinger-Moser type growth $e^{u^p}$ with $p&gt;2$ and the multiple exponential one $\exp{(\cdots(\exp{(u^m)})\cdots)}$ with $m&gt;0$. In this first part, we carry out the analysis of infinite concentration phenomena on any blow-up solutions. As a result, we classify all the infinite concentration behaviors into two types which in particular shows a new behavior for the multiple exponential case. More precisely, we detect an infinite sequence of concentrating parts on any blow-up solutions via the scaling and pointwise techniques. The precise description of the limit profile, energy, and position of each concentration is given via the Liouville equation with two types of the energy recurrence formulas. This leads us to observe two types of supercritical behaviors. The behavior for the latter growth is new and can be understood as the limit case of the former one. Our concentration estimates lead to the analysis of infinite oscillation phenomena, including infinite oscillations of bifurcation diagrams, discussed in the second part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the latter part of our series concerning infinite concentration and oscillation phenomena on supercritical semilinear elliptic equations in discs. Our supercritical setting admits two types of nonlinearities, the Trudinger-Moser type $e^{u^p}$ with $p&gt;2$ and the multiple exponential one $\exp{(\cdots(\exp{(u^m)}))}$ with $m&gt;0$. In the first part, we accomplished the analysis of infinite concentration phenomena on any blow-up solutions. In this second part, we proceed to the study of infinite oscillation phenomena based on concentration estimates obtained in the first part. As a result, we provide a precise description of the asymptotic shapes of the graphs of blow-up solutions near the origin. Two types of oscillation and intersection properties are observed here depending on the choice of the growth. Moreover, it allows us to show several oscillation behaviors around singular solutions with a suitable asymptotic behavior. This leads to a natural sufficient condition for infinite oscillations of bifurcation diagrams which ensure the existence of infinitely many solutions. We successfully apply this condition to certain classes of nonlinearities including the two types mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Weak KAM theory in higher-dimensional holonomic measure flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.08181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a weak KAM theory for parameterized cobordisms and their relaxation, holonomic measures. We find a weak kam solution in that context, and we show that in many cases it corresponds to an exact form that satisfies a version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Along the way, we give a characterization of minimizable Lagrangians, as well as some abstract weak KAM machinery.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation and Adaptive Solution of the Leray-Burgers Equation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate the practical range of the characteristic wavelength parameter(referred to as the smoothing parameter) $\alpha$ in the Leray-Burgers equation. The Leray-Burgers equation, a regularization of the inviscid Burgers equation, incorporates a Helmholtz filter with a characteristic wavelength $\alpha$ to replace the usual convective velocity, inducing a regularized convective velocity. The filter bends the equation's characteristics slightly and makes them not intersect each other, leading to a global solution in time. By conducting computational experiments with various initial conditions, we determine the practical range of $\alpha &gt;0$ that closely approximates the solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation. Our findings indicate that the value of $\alpha$ depends on the initial data, with the practical range of $\alpha$ being between 0.01 and 0.05 for continuous initial profiles and between 0.01 and 0.03 for discontinuous initial profiles. The Leray-Burgers equation captures shock and rarefaction waves within the temporal domain for which training data exists. However, as the temporal domain extends beyond the training interval, data-driven forward computation demonstrates that the predictions generated by the PINN start to deviate from the exact solutions. This study also highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the Leray-Burgers equation in real practical problems, specifically Traffic State Estimation.</description>

      <title>On constant mean curvature 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Bryant on constant mean curvature (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into the hyperbolic space H^3 and after the results of Tarantello (2023), we pursue a possible parametrization for the moduli space of (CMC) 1-immersions of a surface S (closed, orientable and of genus &gt;1) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Those immersions enter as "critical" object in our analysis. In fact, they can be attained only as limits of the (CMC) c-immersions (as c tends to 1), obtained in Huang-Lucia-Tarantello (2022), for |c|&lt;1. However, such passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena, so that the pullback metrics of the (CMC) c-immersions may yield (at the limit) to a singular metric with conical singularities at finitely many points (the blow-up points). In case of genus g=2, blow up can occur only at a single point, and in Tarantello (2023) it was shown how it could be prevented and the passage to the limit ensured in terms of the Kodaira map. In this note we sharpen this result and for genus g=2, we obtaina condition (we believe sharp) which involves only the Kodaira map on the six Weierstrass points. In addition we tackle the case of higher genus, where multiple blow-up points occur. In this case, we need to identify a suitable replacement of the Kodaira map, now defined on the space of non-zero effective divisors. More importantly, we need to improve in a substantial way the asymptotic analysis of Tarantello (2023) limited to the case of "blow-up" with minimal mass. In this direction we give a contribution which best applies to the case of genus g=3, but also provides a relevant step and a convincing indication on what should happen in the general case.</description>

      <title>Sequential bi-level regularized inversion with application to hidden reaction law discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop and present a novel regularization scheme for ill-posed inverse problems governed by nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In our recent work, we introduced a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequentially initializing the lower-level problem, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. Moreover, by collecting the lower-level trajectory, we uncover an interesting connection to the incremental load method. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. We moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality for intrinsic volumes and the $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Consistency of augmentation graph and network approximability in contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning leverages data augmentation to develop feature representation without relying on large labeled datasets. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of contrastive learning remain incomplete, with many essential guarantees left unaddressed, particularly the realizability assumption concerning neural approximability of an optimal spectral contrastive loss solution. In this work, we overcome these limitations by analyzing pointwise and spectral consistency of the augmentation graph Laplacian. We establish that, under specific conditions for data generation and graph connectivity, as the augmented dataset size increases, the augmentation graph Laplacian converges to a weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the natural data manifold. These consistency results ensure that the graph Laplacian spectrum effectively captures the manifold geometry. Consequently, they give way to a robust framework for establishing neural approximability, directly resolving the realizability assumption in a current paradigm.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous and isotropic elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ray transform $L$ over null (light) rays in the pseudo-Euclidean space with signature $(n',n'')$, $n'\ge2$, $n''\ge2$. We analyze the normal operator $L'L$, derive an inversion formula, and prove stability estimates. We show that the symbol $p(\xi)$ is elliptic but singular at the light cone. We analyze $L$ as an Fourier Integral Operator as well. Finally, we compare this to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Learned enclosure method for experimental EIT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.</description>
