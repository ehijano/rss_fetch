      <title>Feature importance of socio-economic parameters in Tuberculosis modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of modeling epidemic outbreaks in different regions with a common model, that uses additional information about these regions to adjust its parameters and relieve us of mundanity of data collecting, and inverse problem solving for each region separately. To that end, we study tuberculosis and HIV dynamics in regions of Russian Federation from 2009 to 2023 in connection with number of socio-economic parameters. SIR-like model was taken and modified as a dynamic model for tuberculosis-HIV co-infection and inverse problem of transfer rates between compartments was solved, based on statistical data of diseases incidence. To shorten the list of socio-economic parameters we make use of Shapley vector that allows us to estimate importance of these parameters in reconstruction of differential model parameters using regression algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales [Di Bari et al., PNAS 121, e2406807121 (2024)]. In analogy with other disordered systems, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven epistatic landscape. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions inspired by statistical physics, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the ancestral protein sequence from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.</description>

      <title>Hybrid metapopulation agent-based epidemiological models for efficient insight on the individual scale: a contribution to green computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging infectious diseases and climate change are two of the major challenges in 21st century. Although over the past decades, highly-resolved mathematical models have contributed in understanding dynamics of infectious diseases and are of great aid when it comes to finding suitable intervention measures, they may need substantial computational effort and produce significant CO2 emissions. Two popular modeling approaches for mitigating infectious disease dynamics are agent-based and population-based models. Agent-based models (ABMs) offer a microscopic view and are thus able to capture heterogeneous human contact behavior and mobility patterns. However, insights on individual-level dynamics come with high computational effort that scales with the number of agents. On the other hand, population-based models using e.g. ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are computationally efficient even for large populations due to their complexity being independent of the population size. Yet, population-based models are restricted in their granularity as they assume a (to some extent) homogeneous and well-mixed population. To manage the trade-off between computational complexity and level of detail, we propose spatial- and temporal-hybrid models that use ABMs only in an area or time frame of interest. To account for relevant influences to disease dynamics, e.g., from outside, due to commuting activities, we use population-based models, only adding moderate computational costs. Our hybridization approach demonstrates significant reduction in computational effort by up to 98% -- without losing the required depth in information in the focus frame. Concluding, hybrid epidemiological models can provide insights on the individual scale where necessary, using aggregated models where possible, thereby making a contribution to green computing.</description>

      <title>The influence of chromosomal inversions on genetic variation and clinal patterns in genomic data of Drosophila melanogaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations resulting in the reversal of the gene order along the corresponding genomic region. Due to their influence on recombination patterns, they can have a major influence on genetic variation and the evolutionary process. Accordingly, inversions can act as supergenes that keep together co-adapted gene complexes that form the genetic basis of many complex phenotypes in diverse organisms. In this book chapter, I will present an analysis pipeline to investigate the influence of two common cosmopolitan inversion, In(2L)t and In(3R)Payne, on genome-wide genetic variation and differentiation in world-wide populations of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. We will use single-individual and pooled resequencing data in combination with population genomics analysis tools to explore the impact of these two inversions on genetic variation, population structure, and clinal variation in natural populations.</description>
