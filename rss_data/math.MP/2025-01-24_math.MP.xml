      <title>v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state density of any non-interacting Schr\"odinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. This result together with recent results from [Sutter el al (2024), J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 475202] provides a complete characterization of the set of non-interacting v-representable densities on the torus. Moreover, we prove that, for said class of non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground-state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities. These results contribute to establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the Kohn-Sham scheme in this simplified setting.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

      <title>The Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>RTT presentation of coideal subalgebra of quantized enveloping algebra of type CI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pair consisting of a quantum group and its corresponding coideal subalgebra, known as a quantum symmetric pair, was developed independently by M. Noumi and G. Letzter through different approaches. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, for symmetric pairs $(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n},\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, we construct a coideal subalgebra $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ of the quantized enveloping algebra of type CI using the $R$-matrix presentation, based on the work of Noumi. Second, we derive a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt(PBW) basis for $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ by the $\mathbb{A}$-form approach. As a consequence of the isomorphism btween $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and the $\imath$quantum group $\mathcal{U}^{\imath}$, our method also yields the PBW basis for the $\imath$quantum group of type CI. Finally, as an application of the $R$-matrix presentation, we construct a Poisson algebra $\mathcal{P}_n$ associated with $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, and explicitly describe the action of the braid group $\mathcal{B}_n$ on the elements of $\mathcal{P}_n$.</description>

      <title>Physics on manifolds with exotic differential structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A given topological manifold can sometimes be endowed with inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers using inequivalent differential structures. Specifically, that means that one observer will say that this is a smooth function while the other observer will say it is not smooth. On the other hand, the notion of a continuous function is the same for both, defined by the common topology. In this paper, we examine the import of inequivalent differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation on the 7-sphere. The 7-sphere was the first, celebrated example, found by Milnor, of a topological manifold that can be endowed with a finite number, 28, of inequivalent differential structures. We find that the spectra of these operators are dependent on the choice of differential structure and hence the identical topological manifolds have different physical laws.</description>

      <title>Linear extrapolation for the graph of function of single variable based on walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk was introduced as a quantum counterpart of the random walk and has been intensively studied since around 2000. Its applications include topological insulators, radioactive waste reduction, and quantum search. The first author in 2019 defined a time-series model based on the measure of the ``discrete-time" and ``discrete-space" quantum walk in one dimension. Inspired by his model, this paper proposes a new model for the graph of a function of a single variable determined by the measure which comes from the weak limit measure of a ``continuous-time or discrete-time" and ``discrete-space" walk. The measure corresponds to a ``continuous-time" and ``continuous-space" walk in one dimension. Moreover, we also presents a method of a linear extrapolation for the graph by our model.</description>

      <title>Grover algorithm and absolute zeta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grover algorithm is one of the most famous quantum algorithms. On the other hand, the absolute zeta function can be regarded as a zeta function over $\mathbb{F}_{1}$ defined by a function satisfying the absolute automorphy. In this study, we show the property of the Grover algorithm and present a relation between the Grover algorithm and the absolute zeta function. We focus on the period of the Grover algorithm, because if the period is finite, then we are able to get an absolute zeta function explicitly by Kurokawa's theorem. In addition, whenever the period is finite or not, an expansion of the absolute zeta function can be obtained by a direct computation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Naked and truly naked rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, it was noticed that in some space-times with Killing horizons some curvature components, responsible for tidal forces, small or even zero in the static frame, become enhanced from the viewpoint of a falling observer. This leads to the notion of so-called naked black holes. If some components in the frame attached to a free-falling observer formally diverge, although scalar invariants remain finite, such space-times was named "truly naked black holes" (in mathematical language, one can speak about non-scalar singularity). Previous results included static spherically symmetric or distorted static metrics. In the present work, we generalized them to include rotation in consideration. We also scrutiny how the algebraic type can change in the vicinity of the horizon due to local Lorentz boost. Our approach essentially uses the Newman-Penrose formalism, so we analyze the behavior of Weyl scalar for different kinds of observers.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to Dynamical Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate integrals of non-holomorphic modular functions over the fundamental domain of the torus with modular parameter $\tau$ analytically. It proceeds in two steps: first the integral is transformed to a Lorentzian contour by the same strategy that leads to the Lorentzian inversion formula in CFT, and then we apply a two-dimensional version of the Rademacher expansion. This computes the integral in terms of an expansion sensitive to the singular behaviour of the integrand near all the Lorentzian cusps $\tau \to i \infty$, $\bar{\tau} \to x \in \mathbb{Q}$. We apply this technique to a variety of examples such as the evaluation of string one-loop partition functions, where it leads to the first analytic formula for the cosmological constants of the bosonic string and the $\mathrm{SO}(16) \times \mathrm{SO}(16)$ string.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Scalar field source Teleparallel Robertson-Walker F(T)-gravity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a scalar field source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case added by a scalar field to find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For $k=0$, we find an easy-to-compute $F(T)$ solution formula applicable for any scalar field source. Then, we obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F(T)$ solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values and well-determined scalar field cases. We can find by those computations a large number of analytical teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions independent of any scalar potential $V(\phi)$ expression. The $V(\phi)$ independence makes the FE solving and computations easier. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom models of physical processes.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Simulation via Stochastic Zassenhaus Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the stochastic Zassenhaus expansions (SZEs), a class of ancilla-free quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation. These algorithms map nested Zassenhaus formulas onto quantum gates and then employ randomized sampling to minimize circuit depths. Unlike Suzuki-Trotter product formulas, which grow exponentially long with approximation order, the nested commutator structures of SZEs enable high-order formulas for many systems of interest. For a 10-qubit transverse-field Ising model, we construct an 11th-order SZE with 42x fewer CNOTs than the standard 10th-order product formula. Further, we empirically demonstrate regimes where SZEs reduce simulation errors by many orders of magnitude compared to leading algorithms.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the quantum entropy (QE) of a system increases due to measurements, it leads to the loss of certain information, part of which may be recoverable. We define Information Loss (IL) as a function of the density matrix through quantum entropy to effectively represent this relationship between gain and loss. For example, if the quantum entropy of a system increases from zero to 2ln2, its information loss rises from zero to 75 percent. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it acquires the highest possible gain in entropy and the maximal loss of information. We analyze the QE and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, multi-qubit systems such as in quantum teleportation, GHZ and W states, as well as the two-qubit Werner mixed states, focusing on their dependence on parameters like polarization bias. We notice that the data exchange between the two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information even years later, indicating that the associated quantum entropy can be removed years later, which implies a possible explanation linked to quantum non-locality. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner state yields the same minimal entropy gain (ln2) and an equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <title>Scattering of Dirac Fields in the Interior of Kerr-Newman(-Anti)-de Sitter Black Holes via Comparison and Symmetry Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a scattering theory for the massive and charged Dirac fields in the interiors of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman(-anti)-de Sitter black holes. More precisely, we show existence, uniqueness and asymptotic completeness of scattering data for such Dirac fields from the event horizon of the black hole to the Cauchy horizon. Our approach relies on constructing the wave operators where the Hamiltonian of the full dynamics is time-dependent. To prove asymptotic completeness, we use two methods. The first involves a comparison operator, while for the second we introduce and employ a symmetry operator of the Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

Abstract: Rietsch constructed a candidate $T$-equivariant mirror LG model for any flag variety $G/P$. In this paper, we prove the following mirror symmetry prediction: the small $T\times\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant quantum cohomology of $G/P$ equipped with quantum $\hslash$-connection is isomorphic as $D_{\hslash}$-modules to the Brieskorn lattice associated to the LG model equipped with Gauss-Manin $\hslash$-connection.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for quad equations II: tetrahedron and octahedron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present four types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form associated to the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. These include the triangle Lagrangian that has traditionally been used in the Lagrangian multiform description of ABS equations, the trident Lagrangian that was central to Part I of this paper, and two Lagrangians that have not been studied in the multiform setting. Two of the Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations and one produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the well-established Lagrangian 2-form for these equations, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations).
  We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>

Abstract: I give an expression for the correlation function of disorder insertions on the edges of the critical Ising model on a cylinder as a function of the aspect ratio (rescaled in the case of anisotropic couplings). This is obtained from an expression for the finite size scaling term in the free energy on a cylinder in periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in terms of Jacobi theta functions.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow in initial data sets and applications to General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math. 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Spatial curvature in coincident gauge $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature for the symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity, giving the first presentation of their coincident gauge form. Our approach explicitly starts with the cosmological Killing vectors and constructs the coincident gauge coordinates adapted to these Killing vectors. We then obtain three distinct spatially flat branches and a single spatially curved branch. Contrary to some previous claims, we show that all branches can be studied in this gauge-fixed formalism, which offers certain conceptual advantages. We also identify common flaws that have appeared in the literature regarding the coincident gauge. Using this approach, we find that both the flat and spatially curved solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity can be seen as equivalent to the metric teleparallel $f(T)$ models, demonstrating a deeper connection between these theories. This is accomplished by studying the connection equation of motion, which can be interpreted as a consistency condition in the gauge-fixed approach. Finally, we discuss the role of diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance in these geometric modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>

      <title>Peierls substitution and Hall motion in exotic Carroll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The particle with first-order dynamics proposed by Dunne, Jackiw and Trugenberger (DJT) to justify the ``Peierls substitution" is obtained by reduction from both of the planar two-parameter centrally extended Galilean and Carroll systems. In the latter case the extension parameters $\kappa_{exo}$ and $\kappa_{mag}$ generate non-commutativity of the coordinates resp. behave as an internal magnetic field. The position and momentum follow uncoupled anomalous Hall motions. Consistently with partial immobility, one of the Carroll boost generators is broken but the other remains a symmetry. Switching off $\kappa_{exo}$, the immobility of unextended Carroll particles is recovered. The Carroll system is dual to an uncharged anyon on the horizon of a black hole which exhibits the spin-Hall effect. Physical applications are shortly reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to an intrinsic geometrical classification of three-mirror telescopes. The problem is formulated as the study of the connected components of a semi-algebraic set. Under first order approximation, we give the general expression of the transfer matrix of a reflexive optical system. Thanks to this representation, we express the semi-algebraic set for focal telescopes and afocal telescopes as the set of non-degenerate real solutions of first order optical conditions. Then, in order to study the topology of these sets, we address the problem of counting and describe their connected components. In a same time, we introduce a topological invariant which encodes the topological features of the solutions. For systems composed of three mirrors, we give the semi-algebraic description of the connected components of the set and show that the topological invariant is exact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of hybridised bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Volume, Polyakov Anomaly and Orbifold Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2310.17536, two of the authors studied the function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}} = S_{\boldsymbol{m}} - \pi \sum_{i=1}^n (m_i - \tfrac{1}{m_i}) \log \mathsf{h}_{i}$ for orbifold Riemann surfaces of signature $(g;m_1,...,m_{n_e};n_p)$ on the generalized Schottky space $\mathfrak{S}_{g,n}(\boldsymbol{m})$. In this paper, we prove the holographic duality between $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ and the renormalized hyperbolic volume $V_{\text{ren}}$ of the corresponding Schottky 3-orbifolds with lines of conical singularity that reach the conformal boundary. In case of the classical Liouville action on $\mathfrak{S}_{g}$ and $\mathfrak{S}_{g,n}(\boldsymbol{\infty})$, the holography principle was proved in arXiv:hep-th/0005106v2 and arXiv:1508.02102, respectively. Our result implies that $V_{\text{ren}}$ acts as K\"ahler potential for a particular combination of the Weil-Petersson and Takhtajan-Zograf metrics that appears in the local index theorem for orbifold Riemann surfaces arXiv:1701.00771. Moreover, we demonstrate that under the conformal transformations, the change of function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ is equivalent to the Polyakov anomaly, which indicates that the function $\mathscr{S}_{\boldsymbol{m}}$ is a consistent height function with a unique hyperbolic solution. Consequently, the associated renormalized hyperbolic volume $V_{\text{ren}}$ also admits a Polyakov anomaly formula. The method we used to establish this equivalence may provide an alternative approach to derive the renormalized Polyakov anomaly for Riemann surfaces with punctures (cusps), as described in arXiv:0909.0807.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by (perturbative) quantum observables in Lorentzian signature we define a new operad: the operad of causally disjoint disks. In order to describe this operad we use the orthogonal categories of Benini, Schenkel, and Woike and the prefactorization functor of Benini, Carmona, Grant-Stuart, and Schenkel. Along the way we extend these constructions to the topological setting, i.e., (multi-)categories enriched over spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the semisimplification of the full karoubian subcategory generated by the irreducible finite dimensional representations of the algebraic supergroup $GL(m|n)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. This semisimplification is equivalent to the representations of a pro-reductive group $H_{m|n}$. We show that there is a canonical decomposition $H_{m|n} \cong GL(m\!-\! n) \times H_{n|n}$, thereby reducing the determination of $H_{m|n}$ to the equal rank case $m\! =\! n$ which was treated in a previous paper.</description>

Abstract: Considered in this work is the Yang-Mills field in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, a physically motivated mathematical model introduced by Bizo\'n and Kahl. The kink is a fundamental, strongly unstable stationary solution in this non-perturbative, variable coefficients model, with a polynomial tail and no explicit form. In this paper, we introduce and extend several virial techniques, adapt them to the inhomogeneous medium setting, and construct a finite codimensional manifold of the energy space where the kink is asymptotically stable. In particular, we handle, using virial techniques, the emergence of a weak threshold resonance in the description of the stable manifold.</description>
