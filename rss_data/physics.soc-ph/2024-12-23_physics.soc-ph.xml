      <title>Do the unvaccinated disproportionately harm the vaccinated in a respiratory pandemic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parameter $\psi$ was recently defined and introduced into the epidemiological modelling scientific literature, and is being accepted. The said parameter was used to argue that there was a disproportionate risk of infection incurred by vaccinated persons due to contacts with unvaccinated persons during the declared COVID-19 pandemic. Opposing published results show that, in general, there is virtually never a disproportionate risk to the vaccinated from the unvaccinated during a respiratory pandemic. Here, we show that the newly introduced vaccinology parameter $\psi$ is incorrectly defined and that the conclusions of disproportionate risk are not valid. Specifically, we prove that the originating authors Fisman et al. (2022, 2024) incorrectly defined and applied the parameter $\psi$. Their application would imply that the said risk increases with increasing segregation from the unvaccinated (up to complete segregation), increases with increasing vaccination coverage (up to complete coverage) and increases with increasing vaccine efficacy (up to perfect vaccine efficacy), which is impossible. Use of the erroneous parameter $\psi$ has the potential to encourage unnecessarily aggressive public health policies and interventions.</description>

      <title>What Leads to Administrative Bloat? A Dynamic Model of Administrative Cost and Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a quantitative, dynamic model that captures how environmental change, alignment with the environment, managerial decisions, and resource constraints interact to give rise to administrative bloat in organizations, resulting in organizational failure. Inspired by empirical findings, we model codified processes that, while initially useful, become obsolete as conditions change, consuming resources until actively removed. Our model predicts a critical threshold in management decision parameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and the propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative burden. This threshold determines two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium, where administrative costs stabilize below resource limits, and runaway administrative bloat, where costs -- dominated by obsolete processes -- grow to resource capacity. The threshold worsens with faster environmental changes. A short-term environmental shock exceeding a critical threshold can push organizations from sustainability into bloat cycles, highlighting the risks posed by events like technological upheaval. Importantly, process creation and pruning propensities have asymmetrical impacts on outcomes. Avoiding administrative bloat requires carefully balancing codified and ad-hoc solutions, weighing error costs, and anticipating future process obsolescence. Finally, We also discuss how our model may be applied to generate insight from existing and future data.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Structure and Resilience of the Brazilian Federal Road Network Through Network Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how transportation networks work is important for improving connectivity, efficiency, and safety. In Brazil, where road transport is a significant portion of freight and passenger movement, network science can provide valuable insights into the structural properties of the infrastructure, thus helping decision makers responsible for proposing improvements to the system. This paper models the federal road network as weighted networks, with the intent to unveil its topological characteristics and identify key locations (cities) that play important roles for the country through 75,000 kilometres of roads. We start with a simple network to examine basic connectivity and topology, where weights are the distance of the road segment. We then incorporate other weights representing number of incidents, population, and number of cities in-between each segment. We then focus on community detection as a way to identify clusters of cities that form cohesive groups within a network. Our findings aim to bring clarity to the overall structure of federal roads in Brazil, thus providing actionable insights for improving infrastructure planning and prioritising resources to enhance network resilience.</description>

      <title>Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach based on the use of complex networks to analyze the structure and content of curricula. We analyze the concept network built from the final year of a particular high school Physics curriculum, as well as that of Mathematics. We examine the most central nodes in each case, the community structures (coherent units or groupings), and the changes that occurred when the network was considered in isolation or integrated with Mathematics. The results show that the integrated Physics and Mathematics network has a higher average degree compared to the individual networks, driven by numerous interdisciplinary connections. The modularity analysis indicates similarities with the original curriculum layout, but also interesting differences that may suggest alternative ways of organizing the content. The differences between separated and integrated networks also highlights the prominence of certain key concepts.</description>

      <title>Predicting human cooperation: sensitizing drift-diffusion model to interaction and external stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As humans perceive and actively engage with the world, we adjust our decisions in response to shifting group dynamics and are influenced by social interactions. This study aims to identify which aspects of interaction affect cooperation-defection choices. Specifically, we investigate human cooperation within the Prisoner's Dilemma game, using the Drift-Diffusion Model to describe the decision-making process. We introduce a novel Bayesian model for the evolution of the model's parameters based on the nature of interactions experienced with other players. This approach enables us to predict the evolution of the population's expected cooperation rate. We successfully validate our model using an unseen test dataset and apply it to explore three strategic scenarios: co-player manipulation, use of rewards and punishments, and time pressure. These results support the potential of our model as a foundational tool for developing and testing strategies aimed at enhancing cooperation, ultimately contributing to societal welfare.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale reconstruction of large supply networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the supply chain network has important implications for modelling economic systems, from growth trajectories to responses to shocks or natural disasters. However, reconstructing firm-to-firm networks from available information poses several practical and theoretical challenges: the lack of publicly available data, the complexity of meso-scale structures, and the high level of heterogeneity of firms. With this work we contribute to the literature on economic network reconstruction by proposing a novel methodology based on a recently developed multi-scale model. This approach has three main advantages over other methods: its parameters are defined to maintain statistical consistency at different scales of node aggregation, it can be applied in a multi-scale setting, and it is computationally more tractable for very large graphs. The consistency at different scales of aggregation, inherent to the model definition, is preserved for any hierarchy of coarse-grainings. The arbitrariness of the aggregation allows us to work across different scales, making it possible to estimate model parameters even when node information is inconsistent, such as when some nodes are firms while others are countries or regions. Finally, the model can be fitted at an aggregate scale with lower computational requirements, since the parameters are invariant to the grouping of nodes. We assess the advantages and limitations of this approach by testing it on two complementary datasets of Dutch firms constructed from inter-client transactions on the bank accounts of two major Dutch banking institutions. We show that the model reliably predicts important topological properties of the observed network in several scenarios of practical interest and is therefore a suitable candidate for reconstructing firm-to-firm networks at scale.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the impact of persuasiveness, cautiousness and prior beliefs in (mis)information sharing on online social networks using Drift Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misleading newsletters can shape individuals' perceptions, and pose a threat to societies; as we witnessed by lowering the severity of follow-up stay-at-home orders and burdening a significant challenge to the fight against COVID-19. In this research, we study (mis)information spreading, reanalyzing behavioral data on online sharing, and analyzing decision-making mechanisms using the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM). We find that subjects display an increased instinctive inclination towards sharing misleading news, but rational thinking significantly curbs this reaction, especially for more cautious and older individuals. On top of network structures with similar characteristics as X, Mastodon, and Facebook, we use an agent-based model to expand this individual knowledge to a large scale where individuals are exposed to (mis)information through friends and share (or not) content with probabilities driven by DDM. We found that the natural shape of these social online networks provides a fertile ground for any news to rapidly become viral. Yet we have found that, for the case of X, limiting the number of followers of the most connected users proves to be an appropriate and feasible containment strategy.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Modelling of Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this tutorial, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation, in the presence of noise, in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM), and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the behaviour of the quantum players (or, \textit{qubits}) in the thermodynamic limit, and for QuPD, we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighbouring quantum players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \textit{Quantum} and the \textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this tutorial demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behaviour in an infinite-player one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.</description>
