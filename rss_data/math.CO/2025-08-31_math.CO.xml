      <title>The Edge-Distinguishing Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a graph coloring game called the Edge-Distinguishing Game (EDGe). The edge-distinguishing chromatic number of a graph is used to determine the moves each player can make. We determine which player has a winning strategy for particular graphs and graph families. Additionally, utilizing principles from game theory as well as previous work on a computational solution for the Game of Cycles.</description>

      <title>A Note on Distance-Fall Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say a proper coloring of a graph is distance-$k$ fall if every vertex is within distance $k$ of at least one vertex of every color. We show that if $G$ is a connected graph of order at least $3$ that is $3$-colorable, thenit has a distance-2 fall 3-coloring. Further, for every integer $k\ge 2$, if $T$ is a tree of order at least $k$, then $T$ has a $k$-coloring such that every vertex is within distance $k-1$ of every color. This proves an old conjecture of Beineke and Henning that every tree of order $n$ has an independent distance-$d$-dominating set of size at most $n/(d + 1)$.</description>

      <title>Sylvester--Gallai configurations on algebraic curves in C^2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sylvester-Gallai theorem says that for any finite set of non-collinear points in $\R^2$, there is some line passing through exactly two points of the set. Over the complex numbers, this theorem fails: there are finite configurations with the property that any line through two points also passes through a third. Only one infinite class of examples (the Fermat configurations) is known, and it is a folklore conjecture that this is the only infinite class of examples. We prove this conjecture in the ``99\% structure'' case where we assume most of the points lie on a low degree algebraic curve.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds on Diffsequences with Gaps in Powers of 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a set of positive integers. A $D$-diffsequence of length $k$ is a sequence of positive integers $a_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; a_k$ such that $a_{i+1}-a_i\in D$ for $i=1,\ldots,k-1$. For $D=\{2^i\mid i\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}\}$, it is known that there exists a minimum integer $n$, denoted by $\Delta(D,k)$, such that every $2$-coloring of $\{1,\ldots n \}$ admits a monochromatic $D$-diffsequence of length $k$. In this work, we prove a new lower bound for $\Delta(D,k)$ to $\Delta(D,k)\ge \left(\sqrt{\frac{8k-5}{12}}-\frac12\right)2^{\left(\sqrt{\frac{8k-5}{3}}-3\right)}$, asymptotically improving the exponential constant in the bound proved by Clifton.</description>

      <title>Matrix Apportionment: General Cases and Apportionment Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matrix is apportionable if it is similar to a matrix whose entries have equal moduli. This paper shows that all nilpotent matrices and all matrices with rank at most half their order are apportionable. General results are established and applied to classify all apportionable matrices of order 2 and partially those of order 3. Additionally, the study of the set of apportionment constants for matrices is initiated.</description>

      <title>Signed counting of partition matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the signed counting (with respect to the parity of the ``$\operatorname{inv}$'' statistic) of partition matrices equals the cardinality of a subclass of inversion sequences. In the course of establishing this result, we introduce an interesting class of partition matrices called improper partition matrices. We further show that a subset of improper partition matrices is equinumerous with the set of Motzkin paths. Such an equidistribution is established both analytically and bijectively.</description>

      <title>On tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex-stabilizers of trivalent edge-transitive graphs have been classified by Tutte, Goldschmidt and some others in several previous papers. Tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs form an important class of tetravalent edge-transitive graphs. Maru\v{s}i\v{c} and Nedela (2001) initiated the study of the problem of classifying vertex-stabilizers of tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs, which has received extensive attention and considerable effort in the literature. In this paper, we solve this problem by proving that a group is the vertex-stabilizer of a connected tetravalent half-arc-transitive graph if and only if it is a non-trivial concentric group. Note that a characterization of concentric groups has been given by Maru\v{s}i\v{c} and Nedela in 2001. Furthermore, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs with automorphism group isomorphic to $A_{2^n}\wr \mathbb{Z}_2$ and vertex-stabilizers isomorphic to $(D_8^2\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n-6})^2$ for $n\geq7$. These are the first known family of basic tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs of bi-quasiprimitive type.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Path Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A path system in a graph $G$ is a collection of paths, with exactly one path between any two vertices in $G$. A path system is said to be consistent if it is intersection-closed. We show that the number of consistent path systems on $n$ vertices is $n^{\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))}$, whereas the number of consistent path systems which are realizable as the unique geodesics w.r.t. some metric is only $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$.
  In addition, these insights allow us to improve known bounds on the face-count of the metric cone as well as on the number of maximum-VC-classes.</description>

      <title>Nice vertices in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subgraph $G'$ of a graph $G$ is nice if $G-V(G')$ has a perfect matching. Nice subgraphs play a vital role in the theory of ear decomposition and matching minors of matching covered graphs. A vertex $u$ of a cubic graph is nice if $u$ and its neighbors induce a nice subgraph. D. Kr\'{a}l et al. (2010) [9] showed that each vertex of a cubic brick is nice. It is natural to ask how many nice vertices a matching covered cubic graph has. In this paper, using some basic results of matching covered graphs, we prove that if a non-bipartite cubic graph $G$ is 2-connected, then $G$ has at least 4 nice vertices; if $G$ is 3-connected and $G\neq K_4$, then $G$ has at least 6 nice vertices. We also determine all the corresponding extremal graphs.
  For a cubic bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(A,B)$, a pair of vertices $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ is called a nice pair if $a$ and $b$ together with their neighbors induce a nice subgraph. We show that a connected cubic bipartite graph $G$ is a brace if and only if each pair of vertices in distinct color classes is a nice pair. In general, we prove that $G$ has at least 9 nice pairs of vertices and $K_{3,3}$ is the only extremal graph.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Combinatorially Symmetric Sign Patterns Requiring a Unique Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sign pattern is a matrix whose entries belong to the set $\{+,-,0\}$. A sign pattern requires a unique inertia if every real matrix in its qualitative class has the same inertia. Symmetric tree sign patterns requiring a unique inertia has been studied extensively in \cite{2001, 2001a, 2018}. Necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the symmetric minimal and maximal rank, as well as conditions depending on the position and sign of the loops in the underlying graph of such patterns has been used to characterize inertia of symmetric tree sign patterns. In this paper, we consider combinatorially symmetric sign patterns with a $0$-diagonal and identify some such patterns with interesting combinatorial properties, which does not require a unique inertia. Initially, we begin with combinatorially symmetric tree sign patterns with a $0$-diagonal, with a special focus on tridiagonal sign patterns. We then consider patterns whose underlying undirected graph contain cycles but no loops, and we derive necessary conditions based on the sign of the edges and the distance between the cycles in the underlying graph for such patterns to require a unique inertia.</description>

      <title>On the isolation number of graphs with minimum degree four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolating set in a graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices such that removing $S$ and its neighborhood leaves no edge. The isolation number $\iota(G)$ of $G$ (also known as the vertex-edge domination number) is the minimum size among all isolating sets of $G$. We provide a technique for proving upper bounds on this parameter for graphs with a given minimum degree. For example, we show that if $G$ has order~$n$ and minimum degree at least~$4$, then $\iota(G) \le 13n/41$, and if $G$ is also triangle-free, then $\iota(G) \le 3n/10$.</description>

      <title>When Many Trees Go to War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that any two trees on the same $n$ leaves can be displayed by a network with $n-2$ reticulations, and there are two trees that cannot be displayed by a network with fewer reticulations. But how many reticulations are needed to display multiple trees? For any set of $t$ trees on $n$ leaves, there is a trivial network with $(t - 1)n$ reticulations that displays them. To do better, we have to exploit common structure of the trees to embed non-trivial subtrees of different trees into the same part of the network. In this paper, we show that for $t \in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there is a set of $t$ trees with virtually no common structure that could be exploited. More precisely, we show for any $t\in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there are $t$ trees such that any network displaying them has $(t-1)n - o(n)$ reticulations. For $t \in o(\lg n)$, we obtain a slightly weaker bound. We also prove that already for $t = c\lg n$, for any constant $c &gt; 0$, there is a set of $t$ trees that cannot be displayed by a network with $o(n \lg n)$ reticulations, matching up to constant factors the known upper bound of $O(n \lg n)$ reticulations sufficient to display \emph{all} trees with $n$ leaves. These results are based on simple counting arguments and extend to unrooted networks and trees.</description>

      <title>Irreversible $k$-Threshold Conversion Number of Corona Product and Double Corona Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the irreversible $k$-threshold process on graphs, where a vertex becomes colored if at least $k$ neighbors are colored and remains colored indefinitely. We investigate vertex sets that, when initially colored, lead to a completely colored graph. The graphs under initial consideration are constructed using the corona product of cyclic graphs and complete graphs. We then introduce and explore double corona product graphs (of cyclic graphs and complete graphs) to study more complex topologies and their impact on the coloring propagation. We further extend the theory by introducing a probabilistic approach to the coloring dynamics. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between graph structure and saturation dynamics by extending the theory to new families of graphs and introducing a probabilistic approach with potential applications in epidemiology and social influence modeling.</description>

      <title>The sandglass conjecture beyond cancellative pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sandglass conjecture, posed by Simonyi, states that if a pair $(A, B)$ of families of subsets of $[n]$ is recovering then $|A| |B| \leq 2^n$. We improve the best known upper bound to $|A| |B| \leq 2.2543^n$. To do this we overcome a significant barrier by exponentially separating the upper bounds on recovering pairs from cancellative pairs, a related notion.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino Conjecture in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the 1978 Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino Conjecture regarding the maximum singularity of $\mathcal{H}=\mathrm{Hilb}^{l}(\mathbb{A}^3)$, where $l$ is a tetrahedral number, by refining the work of Ramkumar-Sammartano in \cite{Ramkumar-Sammartano}. This also immediately implies the conjectural necessary condition for a point of $\mathcal{H}$ to have the maximal singularity, suggested by the second-named author in \cite{Rezaee-23-Conjectures}. In a sequel to this article, \cite{Mackenzie-Rezaee2}, we prove a generalized version of this conjecture for certain non-tetrahedral $l$, via proving the conjectural necessary condition.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-saturation for stable graphs and Littlestone classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any Littlestone class, or stable graph, has finite sets which function as ``virtual elements'': these can be seen from the learning side as representing hypotheses which are expressible as weighted majority opinions of hypotheses in the class, and from the model-theoretic side as an approximate finitary version of realizing types. We introduce and study the epsilon-saturation of a Littlestone class, or stable graph, which is essentially the closure of the class under inductively adding all such virtual elements. We characterize this closure and prove that under reasonable choices of parameters, it remains Littlestone (or stable), though not always of the same Littlestone dimension. This highlights some surprising phenomena having to do with regimes of epsilon and the relation between Littlestone/stability and VC dimension.</description>

      <title>Diagonal operators, $q$-Whittaker functions and rook theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the problem posed by Bender, Coley, Robbins and Rumsey of enumerating the number of subspaces which have a given profile with respect to a linear operator over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We solve this problem in the case where the operator is diagonalizable. The solution leads us to a new class of polynomials $b_{\mu\nu}(q)$ indexed by pairs of integer partitions. These polynomials have several interesting specializations and can be expressed as positive sums over semistandard tableaux. We present a new correspondence between set partitions and semistandard tableaux. A close analysis of this correspondence reveals the existence of several new set partition statistics which generate the polynomials $b_{\mu\nu}(q)$; each such statistic arises from a Mahonian statistic on multiset permutations. The polynomials $b_{\mu\nu}(q)$ are also given a description in terms of coefficients in the monomial expansion of $q$-Whittaker symmetric functions which are specializations of Macdonald polynomials. We express the Touchard--Riordan generating polynomial for chord diagrams by number of crossings in terms of $q$-Whittaker functions. We also introduce a class of $q$-Stirling numbers defined in terms of the polynomials $b_{\mu\nu}(q)$ and present connections with $q$-rook theory in the spirit of Garsia and Remmel.</description>

      <title>Shifted and Threshold Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the class of threshold matroids by the structure of their defining bases. We also give an example of a shifted matroid which is not threshold, answering a question of Deza and Onn. We conclude by exploring consequences of our characterization of threshold matroids: We give a formula for the number of isomorphism classes of threshold matroids on a ground set of size n. This enumeration shows that almost all shifted matroids are not threshold. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to check if a matroid is threshold and provide alternative and simplified proofs of some of the main results of Deza and Onn.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proof of identities involving partitions with distinct even parts and 4-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Andrews and Bachraoui proved identities relating certain restricted partitions into distinct even parts with restricted 4-regular partitions by the theory of basic hypergeometric series. They also posed a question regarding combinatorial proofs for these results. In this paper, we establish bijections to provide combinatorial proofs for these results.</description>

      <title>Diameter bounds for distance-regular graphs via long-scale Ollivier Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive new sharp diameter bounds for distance regular graphs, which better answer a problem raised by Neumaier and Penji\' c in many cases. Our proof is built upon a relation between the diameter and long-scale Ollivier Ricci curvature of a graph, which can be considered as an improvement of the discrete Bonnet-Myers theorem. Our method further leads to significant improvements of existing diameter bounds for amply regular graphs and $(s,c,a,k)$-graphs.</description>

      <title>A Host--Kra ${\mathbf F}_2^\omega$-system of order $5$ that is not Abramov of order $5$, and non-measurability of the inverse theorem for the $U^6({\mathbf F}_2^n)$ norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Bergelson, Tao, and Ziegler \cite{btz} that every Host--Kra $\F_p^\omega$-system of order $k$ is an Abramov system of order $k$. This conjecture has been verified for $k \leq p+1$. In this paper we show that the conjecture fails when $k=5, p=2$. We in fact establish a stronger (combinatorial) statement, in that we produce a bounded function $f: \F_2^n \to \C$ of large Gowers norm $\|f\|_{U^6(\F_2^n)}$ which (as per the inverse theorem for that norm) correlates with a non-classical quintic phase polynomial $e(P)$, but with the property that all such phase polynomials $e(P)$ are ``non-measurable'' in the sense that they cannot be well approximated by functions of a bounded number of random translates of $f$. A simpler version of our construction can also be used to answer a question of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy \cite{CGSS}.</description>

Abstract: We present short proofs of Tverberg-type theorems for cell complexes by S. Hasui, D. Kishimoto, M. Takeda, and M. Tsutaya. One of them states that for any prime power $r$, any complex $X$ topologically homeomorphic to $S^{(d+1)(r-1)-1}$, and any continuous map $f:X\to\mathbb R^d$ there are pairwise disjoint faces $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_r$ of $X$ such that $f(\sigma_1)\cap\ldots f(\sigma_r)\ne\emptyset$.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for the Number of Absent Subsequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A {\em subsequence} of a word $w$ is a word $u$ that can be obtained by deleting some letters from $w$ while maintaining the relative order of the remaining letters, e.g., $\mathtt{lala}$ is a subsequence of $\mathtt{alfalfa}$. A word, over some alphabet $\Sigma$, which has all possible words of length $\iota$ over $\Sigma$ as subsequences is called $\iota$-universal, and the largest $\iota$ for which this holds is called the universality index of $w$, and denoted $\iota(w)$. Moreover, words that are not subsequences of $w$ are called absent subsequences (AS) of $w$, and their investigation was started in (Kosche et al., 2022). In this paper, we present tight bounds on the number of AS of a given length $k$ among all words with the same universality index $\iota$. For both the lower and upper bound, we construct words that have, respectively, a minimal and maximal number of absent subsequences of the respective length $k$, and, in the case of the lower bound, we provide the exact number of missing subsequences as a closed form. Finally, we present efficient enumeration algorithms for the set of subsequences of given length of a word: we give a novel, optimal enumeration algorithm with output linear delay of this set of subsequences, with preprocessing time $O(|w|)$, which is further improved to an incremental enumeration algorithm with $O(1)$ delay of this set of subsequences, with preprocessing time $O(|w|)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong Gelfand pair $(G,H)$ is a finite group $G$ together with a subgroup $H$ such that every irreducible character of $H$ induces to a multiplicity-free character of $G$. We classify the strong Gelfand pairs of the finite symplectic groups ${\rm Sp}_4(q)$ for even $q$.</description>
