      <title>On the efficiency of pairwise Hamiltonian control to desynchronize the higher-order Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is observed in many natural and engineered systems and emerges due to the interactions within the system. It can be both beneficial, e.g., in power grids, and harmful, e.g., in epileptic seizures. In the latter case, efficient control methods to desynchronize the systems are crucial. Recent studies have shown that interactions are not always pairwise, but higher-order, i.e., many-body, and this greatly affects the dynamics. For instance, higher-order interactions increase the linear stability of synchronized states but simultaneously shrink their attraction basin, with potentially opposite effects on control methods. Here, we use a minimally invasive pairwise control based on Hamiltonian control theory, and investigate its efficiency on phase oscillators with higher-order interactions. We show that, if the initial phases are close to the synchronized state, higher-order interactions make desynchronization more difficult to achieve. Otherwise, a non-monotonic effect appears: intermediate strengths of higher-order interactions impede desynchronization while larger ones facilitate it. In all cases, the control can desynchronize the system with a sufficient number of controlled nodes and intensity.</description>

      <title>Finding the Edge of Chaos in a Ferromagnet: Quantifying the "Complexity" of 2D Ising Phase Transitions with Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data-driven characterization of the ``complexity'' present in dynamical systems remains an open problem with broad applications across the physical sciences. We investigate the ``structural complexity'' of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, a paradigmatic system exhibiting a second-order phase transition at a certain critical temperature which is often cited as a canonical example of complex morphology. We define a quantitative metric for this structural complexity, $\mathcal C_s$, through the lens of algorithmic information theory by approximating the Kolmogorov complexity of lattice configurations via standard lossless image compression algorithms. We regularize our proposed metric, $\mathcal C_s$, by comparing the compressibility of a configuration to that of its pixel-wise sorted and randomly shuffled counterparts. We arrive at a definition of $\mathcal C_s$ as a product of two components representing the systems departure from perfect order and disorder respectively which we then plot as a function of temperature. Our numerical simulations reveal a distinct peak in $\mathcal C_s$ at the known critical temperature $T_c$. This result demonstrates that such information-theoretic measures can act as sensitive, model-agnostic indicators of criticality, directly quantifying the emergence of complex structure at the boundary between order and chaos, opening the door to data-driven applications in domains where analytic solutions are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Neural Networks Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are strongly over-parameterized, often containing far more weights than required for their task. Although such redundancy can aid optimization, it leads to inefficient deployment and high computational cost, motivating model compression techniques. Among these, network pruning provides a clear and effective route to sparsity. We study pruning from a statistical-physics perspective, interpreting performance degradation under weight removal as a phase transition. Focusing on magnitude-based pruning with fine-tuning, we show that deep networks undergo a sharp transition from a cooperative, functional phase to a disordered phase with collapsed performance. This transition is characterized by scaling laws consistent with second-order critical behavior, with connectivity as the control parameter. Our findings suggest universal pruning-induced criticality across architectures and datasets. Finally, we show that there exists a large class of subnetworks sharing the same nodes' degrees with similar learning ability, thus linking model performance to its topological properties.</description>

      <title>Finte-size induced random switching of chimeras in a deterministic two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for interacting populations of phase oscillators exhibits chimera states whereby one population is synchronised, and the other is desynchronised. Which of the two populations is synchronised depends on the initial conditions. We show that this deterministic model exhibits random switches of their chimera states, alternating between which of the two populations is synchronised and which is not. We show that these random switches are induced by the finite size of the network. We provide numerical evidence that the switches are governed by a Poisson process and that the time between switches grows exponentially with the system size, rendering switches unobservable for all practical purposes in sufficiently large networks. We develop a reduced stochastic model for the synchronised population, based on a central limit theorem controlling the collective effect of the desynchronised population on the synchronised one, and show that this stochastic model well reproduces the statistical behaviour of the full deterministic model. We further determine critical fluctuation sizes capable of inducing switches and provide estimates for the mean switching times from an associated Kramers problem.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulated annealing optimization with entropy-based cooling rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a modified simulated annealing method with a dynamical choice of the cooling temperature. The latter is determined via a closed-loop control and is proven to yield exponential decay of the entropy of the particle system. The analysis is carried out through kinetic equations for interacting particle systems describing the simulated annealing method in an extended phase space. Decay estimates are derived under the quasi-invariant scaling of the resulting system of Boltzmann-type equations to assess the consistency with their mean-field limit. Numerical results are provided to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>
